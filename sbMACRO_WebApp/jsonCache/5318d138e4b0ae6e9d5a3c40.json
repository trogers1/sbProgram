The PDSI and PHDI are published weekly and aggregated into a monthly dataset by NOAA, at the climate divisional level. Although several drought indices are available; which captures somewhat different aspects of drought conditions (Heim 2000), the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI; Palmer 1965) and Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI; Karl 1986) are commonly used, highly regarded, and readily available metrics. The PDSI, a weekly index of long-term moisture conditions, is produced by NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center and is calibrated to \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 conditions for its own subset of a state known as a climate division, with 0.0 representing average soil moisture conditions at that climate division for that time of year. Positive values represent above-normal moisture conditions for that location and negative values suggest below-normal soil moisture. Because the water balance calculations for PDSI include lags to take into account deep soil moisture conditions, PDSI is often considered in many applications a reasonable and versatile index of medium-term moisture. For evaluating longer-term hydrological conditions, the PHDI may prove more useful, because it's even longer-lagged response to changes in moisture conditions may better reflect the changes in groundwater availability and reservoir supplies that would be characteristic of drought impacts on communities\u2019 long-term water supply and demand (Guttman 1991). These two indices remain the most widely used and cited measures of drought. The versatility and availability of the PDSI and PHDI on a near-real-time basis make these two indices most desirable for use by environmental planners. For the study, these monthly data are extracted for the 45 climate divisions in the five-state region over the 1975-2010 period.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=582a1085e4b01fad8725485c"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -89.0218, "maxY": 37.0015, "minX": -109.0513, "minY": 25.8456}}, "summary": "Drought is a natural hazard that inflicts costly damage to the environment and human communities.

The study region will include all the counties in New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. The varying degrees of drought exposure in these four states provide an ideal setting for comparison. The research will collect and analyze three types of data: county-level data on drought hazards, damages, and socioeconomic variables; drought indices that need to be converted to the county level for analysis, and household surveys of selected counties.

regions in North America: annual agricultural production is valued at more than $44 billion dollars. However, as climate conditions change, the region is experiencing more frequent and severe droughts, with significant impacts on agriculture and broader consequences for land management. For example, in 2011 drought caused an estimated $7.6 billion in agricultural losses in Texas and an additional $1.6 billion in Oklahoma. Although there are many drought monitoring tools available, most of these tools were developed without input from the stakeholders, such as farmers and ranchers, who are intended to use them. The goal of this project is to assess the information needs of farmers, ranchers, and local land managers in the South Central region and to develop drought monitoring tools that are effective and responsive to their needs. The results of this project will be directly and immediately applicable to land management decisions in the region.

"}, {"type": "Technical Summary", "value": "Background: Fire science and fire weather predictions have become a heightened priority following numerous extreme fire episodes during the past decade. The rate and intensity of drought development and the variability in ground-surface conditions that facilitate fire development results from more than simple lack of precipitation or specific wind speeds over a specified period of time. Rather, these major environmental events are emergent properties governed by how soils store and release heat and dry out litter as a consequence of precipitation patterns, soil type, and land-use. Objectives: To develop better predictive models of drought development and thereby increase the accuracy of fire weather forecasting we plan to determine: 1) the rates at which soils across the region gain and store heat as a consequence of rainfall patterns and magnitudes, 2) the extent to which fragmentation of the native landscape and current land uses differ in their heat load dynamics, 3) the regional contributions of land use type to drought development, and 4) how soil heat load dynamics contribute to the fire development under current fire weather criteria. Methods: Using data from the West Texas and Oklahoma MesoNets, we will analyze soil temperature and soil moisture dynamics within representative agroecosystems, grazing systems and native rangeland, and near urban areas during wet and dry years. We plan to determine: 1) the extent to which soil temperatures and soil moisture differ between land uses, 2) the response of soil heat-loads to the length of soil moisture windows, 3) the relationship between air and soil temperature under various land uses, and 4) establish the relationship between soil heat load dynamics, fire weather announcements and fire development. We can then develop a model that can predict the development of severe drought conditions (hence, fire risk) based upon projected air temperatures and precipitation. Expected Products & Information Transfer: We plan to 1) quantify the contribution of soil moisture and soil heat profiles to drought development and fire frequency under pronounced fire weather warnings during wet and dry years, 2) produce a \u201cdrought development score\u201d that establishes the potential of specific soil moisture and heat load conditions that induces region wide drought, 3) establish a regional map that links land use, soil type and potential for drought development , and 4) model responses of soil temperatures using regional models for predicted future air temperature.

Soil moisture, an important modulator of soil thermal regime, is expected to change as regional climate models predict rainfall patterns to increase in magnitude, but with longer intervals between rain events. The time is now to fine-tune the fire weather forecast predictions using soil temperature, soil moisture and weather conditions for a variety of managed and unmanaged systems in West Texas and Oklahoma. We plan to use long-term data (> 8 years) to provide us with a more solid understanding of drought development conditions (hence, fire weather risk, or additionally, for drought risk) under different scenarios of precipitation size and soil temperature.

Future species ranges and fire frequencies will be joined to describe changes in ecosystems, fire, and desertification effects. Background: This proposal directly addresses the SC CSC over-arching theme of precipitation variability and specifically responds to two suggested examples under Priority 2d, Ecosystems and Landscapes: \u201cWhere will woody plants reside in 2050, and how will fire regimes change, using an existing fire regime model (e.g., Guyette et al 2012. Predicting fire frequency with chemistry and climate. Ecosystems 15(2): 322-335) paired with existing climate projection models to develop maps of projected change.\u201d The two lead authors on the RFP-referenced paper (Guyette and Stambaugh) are investigators on this project. They developed the Physical Chemistry Fire Frequency Model (PC2FM) to estimate fire frequency from temperature and precipitation inputs, which are independent of non-climatic influences such as changes in vegetation, ignition sources, and land use. Methods: Future annual precipitation and temperature means derived from various climate models will be used as inputs to the PC2FM model to predict the future climate-forced fire frequencies. We will use model output to quantify past to future changes in fire frequency and the conditions and locations of desertification.

A part of this requirement is conducting a full hazard vulnerability assessment. A vulnerability assessment training program is needed to identify the potential strengths and weaknesses in the event of disaster impact. A vulnerability assessment asks: What types of hazards is your community faced with? What structures and infrastructure are at risk? Who in your community is likely to experience physical and/or social impacts?\r\n\r\nThe University of Oklahoma\u2019s Division of Regional and City Planning, together with partners from the Hazard Reduction and Recovery Center (HRRC) at Texas A&M University,  seeks to engage tribal leaders and OU research in a training opportunity centered on the topic of vulnerability assessment.  The HRRC was established as an interdisciplinary research center in 1988. One of only two United Nations (UN-OCHA) Collaborative Centers in the world, the HRRC strives \u201cto provide assistance and consultation to state, national and international agencies charged with responsibility for hazard analysis, emergency preparedness and response, disaster recovery, and hazard mitigation.\u201d Since 2011, the HRRC has developed a full set of curriculum and has trained professionals across the country on vulnerability assessments.  The following describes a training program that would facilitate the fulfillment of federal requirements with respect for tribes seeking to qualify for disaster relief assistance.  \r\n\r\nTraining Plan  \r\nThe following describes the general approach and timeline to conducting the training program. \r\n\r\nApril 2014. RCPL faculty will conduct a series of interviews to tribal representatives from the Citizen Potawatomie, Chickasaw, Absentee Shawnee, Ponca, to gage the full breadth of issues the community finds pertinent to assessing vulnerability. Interviewees would provide a prioritized list of training needs. Needs may include, expanded clarification on specific topics, technical skills assistance, etc. The RCPL faculty will deliver this information to its HRRC partners for preparation of the May workshop on or before April 30, 2014.\r\n\r\nLate May 2014. The HRRC will prepare a one day workshop based on the information solicited by the RCPL faculty for delivery to tribal representatives, university researchers, and LCC participants at the end of May or in early June, as is most convenient for the participants. The workshop would delve into specific needs associated with conducting a vulnerability assessment that is culturally appropriate and mindful of the past to chart a course for the future. Workshops would include lectures, presentations, activities, and interactive exercises. The workshop will be held on OU\u2019s campus at the South Central Climate Science Center.  The SC-CSC has resources available that will engage the 64 sovereign tribal nations in the South central region, particularly in reviewing the materials and resources for tribally relevant information, finding appropriate workshop locations, and inviting outstanding tribal environmental professionals and managers who will be leaders and participate in the workshops.\r\n\r\nNext Steps\r\nBy the end of this course, participants will be able to thoughtfully determine hazard exposures, physical vulnerabilities, and social vulnerabilities and will understand that by prioritizing vulnerable areas, communities can inject essential support and resources most efficiently. Also, participants will determine the variety of assets within their community and overall, will think more holistically about planning for their community to ultimately become more resilient to disaster impacts. This community planning approach, mindful of tribal traditions, will help train community leaders plan and prepare for natural or technological hazards.

The research team will work with a small set of tribes in this first phase of the project to identify the potential strengths and weaknesses in the event of a disaster. In order to conduct a vulnerability assessment within a community, a full understanding of current community conditions is needed. The following is a list that will likely come up in the process:\n\nPre-impact Conditions: The Disaster Impacts Model provides an overall context of disasters in community planning. A vulnerability assessment specifically investigates the \u2018pre-impact conditions\u2019 of a community as described within the model (hazard exposure, physical vulnerability, and social vulnerability).\n\nHazard Exposure: Participants will identify the variety of hazards their community is exposed to (i.e. wind, winter weather, drought & heat, severe weather, flooding, tornado, wildfire, Hazardous material sites) and assess the likelihood of community exposure. Participants will also understand the data sources available to them.\n\nPhysical Vulnerability: Participants will determine the physical components within a community, particularly critical facilities and lifelines.\n\nSocial Vulnerability: Participants will investigate an often neglected component of community vulnerability: social vulnerability. Facilitators will describe the current research on social vulnerability and will describe the demographic characteristics which may hinder a populations\u2019 ability to anticipate, respond to, and cope with a disaster.\n\nAsset Mapping: Based on the three previous \u2018pre-impact conditions\u2019 assessments, participants will discover elements within the community that can act as particular assets upon disaster impact.\n\nTechnical Needs: Facilitators will provide specific tools community leaders can use to assess vulnerability. Accessing refined data on your community is an important component in developing an overall vulnerability assessment (i.e. American Community Survey, web-based mapping tools, etc.).", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=54341298e4b095098ca896e8"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -94.431218, "maxY": 37.002327333, "minX": -103.002645333, "minY": 33.615764333}, "representationalPoint": [-98.7169316665, 35.309045833], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Tribal Climate Change and Extreme Event Response Studies to Identify Vulnerability Assessments: A South Central CSC Directed Funding 2014 Project", "summary": "Climate change is poised to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events \u2013 such as tornadoes, flooding, drought, and snowstorms \u2013 which may damage buildings and other structures, cause economic hardship, disrupt plant and wildlife communities, and endanger people\u2019s physical and emotional health.

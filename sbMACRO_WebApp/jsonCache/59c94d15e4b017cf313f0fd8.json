We use the daily measurements at SNOTEL stations to identify snow droughts as a function of snow water equivalent (SWE) and further define warm and dry snow drought based on the ratio of SWE to winter precipitation (or SWE/P) ratios. We will build statistical models with the SNOTEL data to predict the occurrence of different types of snow droughts across the Southwest. Next, we will evaluate the accuracy of 30-50 April-July streamflow volume forecasts from the NRCS and California DWR. After identifying where forecast skill is low following snow droughts, we will use a novel two-step principal component regression method to introduce additional information, such as SWE/P ratio or soil moisture, into the streamflow forecasts. Finally, we will explore the aspects of snow drought that promote wildland fire by investigating the historical effects of snow-drought types on the seasonal wildfire outlook, summer fuel moisture, and energy release observations. We expect the project to deliver multiple peer-reviewed journal articles, useful and publicly available datasets, and several management briefs that distill the science findings. Project results and dataset access will be provided through a simple website. We have partnered with previous collaborators at the NRCS and California DWR to work on streamflow forecasts. The project has received support and input from a variety of collaborators spanning water, climate, and forest/range managers and planners."}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}, {"annualBudgets": [{"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds": 89381.0, "year": "2017"}], "className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet", "facetName": "Budget", "parts": [{"type": "Award Type", "value": "Grant"}, {"type": "Award Number", "value": "G17AP00101"}], "totalFunds": 89381.0}], "files": [{"checksum": {"type": "MD5", "value": "56392c771e929fde860b406bca99b5b9"}, "contentEncoding": null, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "dateUploaded": "2017-06-21T19:13:59Z", "downloadUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5937201ae4b0f6c2d0d89a85?f=__disk__94%2Fbd%2Fe7%2F94bde71b7bde8cb4b9b1ffb35523e89128fe1fa6", "imageHeight": 1536, "imageWidth": 2048, "name": "SierraNevada_CA_BLM.jpg", "originalMetadata": false, "pathOnDisk": "__disk__94/bd/e7/94bde71b7bde8cb4b9b1ffb35523e89128fe1fa6", "previewImage": {"large": {"height": 750, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5937201ae4b0f6c2d0d89a85?f=__disk__94%2Fbd%2Fe7%2F94bde71b7bde8cb4b9b1ffb35523e89128fe1fa6&width=1000&height=750", "width": 1000}, "medium": {"height": 435, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5937201ae4b0f6c2d0d89a85?f=__disk__94%2Fbd%2Fe7%2F94bde71b7bde8cb4b9b1ffb35523e89128fe1fa6&width=580&height=435", "width": 580}, "small": {"height": 263, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5937201ae4b0f6c2d0d89a85?f=__disk__94%2Fbd%2Fe7%2F94bde71b7bde8cb4b9b1ffb35523e89128fe1fa6&width=350&height=263", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 113, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5937201ae4b0f6c2d0d89a85?f=__disk__94%2Fbd%2Fe7%2F94bde71b7bde8cb4b9b1ffb35523e89128fe1fa6&width=150&height=113", "width": 150}}, "processToken": null, "processed": false, "s3Object": null, "size": 823518, "title": "Sierra Nevada, CA;

To remedy this serious knowledge gap, researchers will examine causes, effects, and forecastability of snow drought to provide guidance to decision makers.\n\nPreliminary analyses indicate that several different types of snow droughts occur in the southwest U.S., arising from a variety of different factors. \u201cDry snow drought\u201d is caused by a lack of winter precipitation needed to accumulate snow. \u201cWarm snow drought\u201d can be caused by early snowmelt or by precipitation falling as rain rather than snow. This project will address two key questions regarding snow drought that will have large management implications: 1) What are the effects of snow drought on water-resources forecasting skill and can that skill be improved by adding snow drought information? and 2) What are the effects of snow drought on historical wildfires and forecasts of wildfire risks? Efforts to improve water resources and wildfire forecasts are critically important for Southwestern communities and economies. Improved water resources forecasting can allow better use of vital snowmelt supplies in drought years, and fighting wildfires costs billions annually. Small improvements in forecasting can help managers improve efficiency and reduce costs. Improved understanding of snow drought frequency, causes, and effects on seasonal forecasting will benefit a variety of end-users and can improve resource predictions and planning in the face of increasing climate extremes.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5937201ae4b0f6c2d0d89a85"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -105.628326416016, "maxY": 43.4501457214355, "minX": -124.411186218262, "minY": 31.329174041748}, "representationalPoint": [-115.019756317139, 37.38965988159175], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Learning From Recent Snow Droughts To Improve Resource Management", "summary": "In the dry southwestern United States, snowmelt plays a crucial role as a water source for people, vegetation, and wildlife.

These changes have implications for the phenology, or the timing of natural life events (e.g. the timing of plant flowering in Spring or leaves falling in Autumn), of many plant species. However, not all species and regions are changing at the same rate, which can lead to mismatches (e.g. between the emergence of plants and pollinators in early spring). Many interactions in nature depend on timing and, as such, phenology affects nearly all aspects of the environment, including the abundance, distribution, and diversity of organisms, ecosystem services, food webs, even global water and carbon cycles.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nPhenology is among the best indicators of climate change impacts, in large part because phenological events are some of the most sensitive biological responses to environmental changes. Researchers are rapidly developing datasets, models, and indices that can improve our understanding of changing phenology. However, most indices of phenological change are poorly suited for water-limited ecosystems, and existing models are lacking in their ability to represent phenological change at local scales that are relevant and useful for decision making.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis project is a step towards addressing these limitations. The project team aims to use local phenology data and climate information to build new phenology indices and models for the southwestern U.S. that address several significant information gaps, with a specific focus on creating useful and relevant data products and decision-support tools for managers. These models will be used to evaluate variations in historical phenology trends based on time period, plant type, geography, and moisture availability. The team plans to generate a phenology tool that resource managers in the Southwest can use to predict phenology events (e.g. plant green-up) based on a specified climate (historical, future near-term, and long-term). This work will help to ensure that phenological information can be used to inform conservation planning and resource management decisions in the Southwest.&nbsp;", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"contactType": "person", "email": "smunson@usgs.gov", "highlighted": true, "name": "Seth Munson", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Southwest Biological Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "Flagstaff", "country": "USA", "line1": "Northern Arizona University 525 S.

phenological events are among the most sensitive biological responses to climate change. Across the globe, many spring events are occurring earlier \u2014 and fall events later \u2014 than they did in the past. However, not all species and regions are changing at the same rate, which can lead to mismatches. Many interactions in nature depend on timing and, as such, phenology affects nearly all aspects of the environment, including the abundance, distribution, and diversity of organisms, ecosystem services, food webs, even global water and carbon cycles.\n\nOne significant barrier to progress in advancing our understanding and utilization of phenology information entails the ability of the existing models to represent phenological change at more local scales, where decisions are being made. The work described in this proposal represents a critical first step in addressing this need. We propose to transfer well-established methods used to develop models of phenology to the Southwest region specifically. In a sense, we expect to \u2018downscale\u2019 and calibrate models to the unique environment and species of the Southwest. Because we will work closely with stakeholders from the very beginning, we can make a reasonable promise to deliver information that not only advances the science, but makes the science immediately relevant and useful.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=59372060e4b0f6c2d0d89a9e"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -109.0432, "maxY": 42.0023, "minX": -124.3926, "minY": 31.3356}, "representationalPoint": [-116.7179, 36.668949999999995], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Actionable Phenological Science for the Water-Limited Southwest", "summary": "In many places around the world, spring events, like warming temperatures, are coming earlier and fall events are coming later than they have in the past.

and conservation organizations in the southwestern United States (Southwest) with long-term, spatially explicit projections of resource availability for herbivores in desert grasslands that will support the design of effective conservation strategies. Some forms of climate extremes, including droughts, heat waves, and atmospheric river events, are expected to occur with increasing frequency and magnitude in the Southwest. Research on how desert grasslands and the wildlife communities they support are likely to respond to these climatic changes can have substantial ecological and social benefits. Models of wildlife responses to climate change largely have focused on projected changes in average temperature and precipitation, but changes in resource availability may be more relevant to wildlife and more readily affected by conservation and management actions. Remotely sensed phenology metrics are responsive to climate and hydrological variables and can serve as useful indicators of resource availability for herbivores, but long-term projections of phenology under future climate scenarios are not yet available. The main components of this project are development of statistical models of the relations between historical climate and remotely sensed phenology variables; projections of future phenology on the basis of these statistical models, with downscaled climate projections as model inputs; assessment of relations between space use, abundance, or occupancy of focal wildlife species and phenology variables; and projection of changes in space use, abundance, or occupancy of these species on the basis of future phenology scenarios. Analyses will focus on grassland species considered regional management priorities because of their rarity, economic importance, or ecological role as a keystone species.

We then will use climate models to project how forage, and ultimately wildlife populations, are likely to respond to projected changes in climate. This project will focus on desert grasslands, which support many wildlife species of management concern and economic value. We will model the effects of changing resource availability on four grassland species: American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), Gunnison\u2019s prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni), Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamat), and Gambel\u2019s Quail (Callipepla gambelii).\n\nThe approaches and methods developed in this project may be relevant to land cover types, geographic areas, and species beyond Southwest grasslands. This project will help inform landscape-level planning, establish conservation priorities, and suggest management approaches for adapting to shifting climate and resource availability for wildlife. For example, results of this research could be used by state wildlife agencies to guide management of grasslands for species of greatest conservation need or economically important game species, by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to establish high-priority locations within the National Wildlife Refuge System, and by conservation organizations to prioritize conservation easements and land purchases in grasslands likely to remain high-quality habitat for wildlife.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=59371d3ae4b0f6c2d0d89a40"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -109.0432, "maxY": 42.0023, "minX": -124.3926, "minY": 31.3356}, "representationalPoint": [-116.7179, 36.668949999999995], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "summary": "The desert grasslands of the southwestern United States support many wildlife species of management concern and economic value.

Warming temperatures, clearly documented in climate records for the Colorado River basin, are having an impact on the amount of annual streamflow yielded from rain and snow. Recent work has revealed that warming temperatures have played an increasingly important role over the past decades, both exacerbating droughts and dampening the effects of wet winters on high stream flows. Understanding and anticipating how warming temperatures will influence future water supply in the Colorado River basin is increasingly important for resource management, particularly in light of recent drought conditions.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThe overarching goals of this project are to better understand the influence of temperature on Colorado River streamflow, particularly during droughts, and assist water managers in planning for future droughts. This work expands on <a href=\"https://nccwsc.usgs.gov/projects/#/project/4f8c6580e4b0546c0c397b4e/52afcd05e4b0978c01d10420\">a recently completed study</a>, building on that project in two main ways. First, this project extends collaborative work between scientists and Colorado River basin water managers to investigate the range of potential drought conditions under early 21<sup>st</sup> century warming, using both recent and historical data. For example, with precipitation reconstructions from tree rings for the past 500 years, the team can use a simple hydrologic model to assess the impacts of the longest and most severe droughts of the past on the Colorado River under today\u2019s warmer temperatures. With this information, the project team will contribute to a set of plausible scenarios of future drought that planners can use to help make resource-management decisions. Second, the project is more explicitly examining the drivers of Colorado River drought, with a focus on factors such as the phase of precipitation (rain vs. snow), the timing and rate of snowmelt, and evaporation rates. The project team will also begin to explore the ways that changing temperatures and streamflow might impact the ecological health of the upper Colorado River basin.", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"contactType": "person", "email": "conniew1@email.arizona.edu", "highlighted": true, "name": "Connie Woodhouse", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "TUCSON", "country": "USA", "line1": "School of Geography and Development, 1064 E.

temperatures, clearly documented in instrumental records in the Colorado River basin, are having an impact on the amount of annual streamflow yielded from rain and snow. Warmer temperatures result in less flow than might be anticipated, given the precipitation that has fallen. The goal of this project is to assist water managers in planning for future droughts in the Colorado River basin in two main ways. First, it addresses the need for future drought scenarios for planning. Natural climate variability, that has included droughts, will continue but with the added influence of warmer temperatures. Consequently, droughts of the past are not a reliable baseline for anticipating future drought and their impacts. However, droughts of the past plus warming temperatures can provide scenarios of plausible future droughts that could answer questions such as: \u201cWhat would Colorado River flow look like if we have a 1950s-like drought today or in the next decade?\u201d This perspective can be extended using reconstructions of precipitation from tree rings for the past 500 years, with warming, to assess the impacts of the longest and most severe droughts of the past five centuries on the Colorado River under today\u2019s warmer temperatures. The second way this study will address the need for better drought information is to more closely examine just what it is about warming temperatures that may influence streamflow. We will use models of streamflow that allow an examination of the basin locations and/or levels of streamflow that may be most vulnerable to warming. This information will help water managers be prepared to anticipate how water resources will be impacted by the range of climatic conditions that are likely to occur in the future. Finally, this project will use similar methods to assess the ecological impacts of drought on the upper Colorado River basin.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=59372047e4b0f6c2d0d89a94"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -105.6283, "maxY": 43.4501, "minX": -112.3263, "minY": 35.5579}, "representationalPoint": [-108.9773, 39.504], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Anticipating Future Impacts on Streamflow using Multi-Century Climate Records and Applied Hydrologic Models", "summary": "The Colorado River is a crucial water source for millions of people in the Southwest.

Decision makers at all scales are looking for the best scientific information to guide their decisions about adapting to and mitigating the negative effects of climate change. Development of actionable science \u2013 scientific information that can be easily used to inform these decisions \u2013 is the goal of the Southwest Climate Science Center (SW CSC) and the CSC network as a whole. There is evidence that more collaborative forms of knowledge development and exchange between researchers and decision makers (and between policy makers and the public) tend to produce information that is more trusted (Cash et al. 2006), considered more usable (Carbone and Dow 2005; Jasanoff and Wynne 1998; Lemos et al. 2012), and lead to higher-quality decisions about environmental management (Beierle 2002). Collaborative forms of knowledge production appear to be particularly effective when dealing with questions that can be described as \u201cwicked\u201d (Rittel and Webber 1973) \u2013 involving not just the need for scientific information, but also decisions about resource allocation and policy that bring values into the decision-making discussion (Hegger et al. 2012; Mauser et al. 2013; Walter et al. 2007). This evidence of the benefits of collaboratively produced science knowledge has led to a focus on the co-production of knowledge (Jasanoff and Wynne 1998) as a desirable approach to the development of actionable science within the CSC network (Advisory Committee on Climate Change and Natural Resource Science 2015). However, as a community, we continue to search for effective ways to integrate practices that promote collaboration and co-production of knowledge into our established research programs and organizational frameworks. (Fazey et al. 2014; A. M. Meadow et al. 2015; Reed et al. 2014) and to effectively evaluate projects that no longer resemble standard academic research projects because they integrate decision-makers in a full and collaborative manner (Bell et al. 2011; Roux et al. 2010; Wall et al. 2017). We (Meadow and Wall) have developed a framework for the evaluation of collaboratively produced climate science that specifically addresses the process of producing and outcomes of actionable science (Wall et al. 2017) (see Appendix A). We propose to apply the framework to a sample of projects funded by the SW CSC to assess the degree to which SW CSC-funded research has met (or is likely to meet) the expectations of \u201cactionability\u201d as well as identifying those factors that either facilitate or inhibit the production of usable information. We propose to evaluate a sample of projects funded by the SW CSC to determine: 1. To what extent the science is being applied to management decisions in the SW CSC region. 2. What the barriers are to use of science (form/content of science itself or barriers within agency decision-making structure, for example). 3. Which practices or strategies are most associated with the production of actionable science."}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}, {"annualBudgets": [{"fundingSources": [],

These invasions often cause management agencies to incur high costs for prevention, control, restoration, and fire responses.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nControl and prevention of invasive species is challenging because the risk of invasive plants becoming abundant depends on existing plant communities, climate and weather, land use, and fire history. Moreover, scientific information on invasion risk that does exist has not always been translated into maps that planners and resource managers can use in their decision making. Broad-scale information is needed to link geographic variation in climate and disturbances (e.g. fire) to decisions on the ground regarding where to apply treatments aimed at limiting the impacts of invasions and restoring native plant composition.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis project aims to use existing datasets to understand the links between the abundance of major plant invaders and climatic extremes, land use and fire history. The project team will examine how the drivers and limits of plant abundance vary among invasive species and across the Great Basin and Mojave Desert. For example, where is cheatgrass likely to be limited by drought and temperature extremes, and are those areas vulnerable to red brome invasion?

We propose to link large existing datasets on invasive plant cover, climate and weather, land use, and fire history to develop spatial maps of invasion risk for several problematic invasive species. Our objectives are to (i) describe the climatic conditions under which focal invaders occur and reach high abundance; (ii) model spatial variation in the drivers of invader abundance; and (iii) develop mapped products linking risk of high invasive plant cover to management strategies that emphasize local protection, prevention, restoration, or tolerance. Background for our work is provided by existing conceptual models of vegetative states and transitions and by empirical studies of how climate and weather affect cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). These areas of existing research will help us select key variables and interactions to include in our models, and will guide the development of indices of climatic means and extremes. Our methodological approach is based on spatial statistical models, which allow the effects of each driver to vary over space, and an integrated and iterative communication strategy in which our methods and products will be shaped and refined based on partner feedback. Products will include a peer-reviewed publication and maps of invasion risk. These maps will depict spatial variation in the drivers of invader abundance within the Great Basin and Mojave Desert. Results will be integrated to develop a spatially-explicit guide for decision-making given climatic extremes and disturbances. Our products will be refined through a participatory science workshop and consistent communication with managers, and results will be disseminated at a management-focused conference, via websites and webinars, and via continuing outreach efforts.

Targeting invasion control and prevention efforts is challenging because the risk of invasive plants becoming abundant depends on existing plant communities, climate and weather, land use, and fire history. Although the general form of these interactions may be understood conceptually, the critical question of identifying \u2018where\u2019 remains: variation in invasion risk is not always translated into maps that planners and managers can use. A broad-scale, geographic perspective is needed to link geographic variation in climate and disturbance to decisions on the ground regarding where to apply treatments aimed at limiting the impacts of invasions and restoring native plant composition. The lack of a geographic perspective is particularly acute for the effects of climate and weather extremes, which are known to affect invasion risk and the grass-fire cycle but have not been linked to invasive plant abundance at broad scales.\n\nOur work will leverage existing datasets to link the abundance of major plant invaders to climatic extremes, as well as to land use and fire history. We will ask how the drivers and limits of invader abundance vary among invasive species and across the Great Basin and Mojave Desert. For example, where is cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) likely to be limited by drought and temperature extremes, and are those areas vulnerable to red brome (B. madritensis) invasion? Where should we be most concerned about annual grass invasion following wildfire? Our focus on invasive plant abundance will extend previous studies of species\u2019 occurrence, because it is the abundance of invasive plants that affect their ecological and economic impacts, as well as potential control strategies. Our work will inform management by providing a nuanced spatial perspective on invasion risk for current and potential invaders.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=59371e43e4b0f6c2d0d89a56"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -106.3984, "maxY": 44.4175, "minX": -121.3082, "minY": 33.5665}, "representationalPoint": [-113.85329999999999, 38.992], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Spatial Variation in the Role of Climatic Extremes in Shaping Plant Invasions", "summary": "Invasive plants are a major land management problem in the Western U.S. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is the most prominent and problematic invader in cold deserts, with negative effects on rangeland fire patterns, wildlife habitats, and forage/vegetation.

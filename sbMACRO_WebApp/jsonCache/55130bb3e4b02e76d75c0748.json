A focused document portal with geospatial and semantic search capabilities would assist land use mangers in their decision-making and planning processes by connecting them to current and historical research and scientific reports within their region of interest. Effective scientific communication and outreach relies on improving access for stakeholders to discover research, plans, and data within their geographic area of interest.

Alaska provides important breeding ground for hundreds of migratory bird species that travel thousands of miles in their annual migrations between breeding and wintering spots.<br>\n<br>\nUnderstanding how climate and land use changes affect migratory bird populations is crucial; however this information is also very difficult to collect. Migration routes expose birds to a wide range of landscapes and habitats, which are often experiencing varying degrees of climate and land use change (e.g. warmer temperatures or increased housing developments). Moreover, climate change in the future may cause bird populations to shift their migration patterns, adding even more complexity. Visible impacts to bird populations are the cumulative result of many factors, giving researchers a major challenge when trying to pinpoint the most important threats.<br>\n<br>\nAs an important step towards unraveling these different threats to migratory birds, this project will define a large-scale multi-region strategy to help prioritize and guide future research. The researchers will use literature reviews, surveys, and coordination with other researchers and managers to identify the major gaps in our understanding.

Because life history requirements and the timing of migration varies among migrant guilds and species, and because climate change is heterogeneous throughout North America (IPCC 2007) it is unlikely that the direction or magnitude of climate effects, or non-climate stressors for that matter, on the seasonal habitats (breeding, stopover, wintering) of any species or guild is consistent.  Climate change may be beneficial on one seasonal range, detrimental on another and the cumulative effects across annual life cycles and decades may not be known unless there is a coordinated and focused effort to integrate research across the entire annual range of a migrant or group of migrants, i.e., across multiple CSCs.  Population trends result from the sequential cumulative effects of habitat quality and mortality sources on survival and fecundity schedules as migrants traverse their annual routes from year to year.  Seasonal use areas ignore administrative boundaries and habitat quality and mortality factors in each of the seasonal use areas of migrants affects energy balance, productivity and survival (performance) but explicit pathways, nature (additive, multiplicative), relative strengths and sum of effects are generally unknown.  This project will employ 1) an intensive literature review to a) identify knowledge gaps in regard to waterfowl life histories and potential strength an direction of climate effects on their seasonal ranges; 2) a questionnaire survey of researchers and managers from seasonal ranges to identify most critically needed life history and habitat information from adjacent ranges (i.e., breeding, stopover, wintering) and an assessment of the relative strength of climate and non-climate stressors on seasonal and annual waterfowl performance; 3) a special session at a regional/national meeting to summarize, discuss and refine the results of 1 and 2 into a draft research framework that emphasizes common and transferrable variables of appropriate temporal and spatial scale. The draft research framework will be distributed to cooperators/partners for review and comment and ultimately published in a peer reviewed journal such as Environmental Management.  Personnel will include the PI, Co-PI and a Post-doctoral student.  Cooperators and partners will include willing and interested waterfowl researchers and managers within the Alaska, North Central and South Central CSC domains (this includes 9 LCCs, 10 Joint Ventures and multiple State management agencies)."}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}], "files": [{"checksum": null, "contentEncoding": null, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "dateUploaded": "2016-02-16T22:16:44Z", "downloadUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/55130d2fe4b02e76d75c076b?f=__disk__d9%2Fb1%2F35%2Fd9b135635298f725929451d11d5e96403be9940c", "imageHeight": 1525, "imageWidth": 2032, "name": "AK-2015-1_CommonEiders_AK_KristineSowl_FWS.jpg", "originalMetadata": false, "pathOnDisk": "__disk__d9/b1/35/d9b135635298f725929451d11d5e96403be9940c", "previewImage": {"large": {"height": 750, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/55130d2fe4b02e76d75c076b?f=__disk__d9%2Fb1%2F35%2Fd9b135635298f725929451d11d5e96403be9940c&width=1000&height=750", "width": 1000}, "medium": {"height": 435, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/55130d2fe4b02e76d75c076b?f=__disk__d9%2Fb1%2F35%2Fd9b135635298f725929451d11d5e96403be9940c&width=580&height=435", "width": 580}, "small": {"height": 263, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/55130d2fe4b02e76d75c076b?f=__disk__d9%2Fb1%2F35%2Fd9b135635298f725929451d11d5e96403be9940c&width=350&height=263", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 113, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/55130d2fe4b02e76d75c076b?f=__disk__d9%2Fb1%2F35%2Fd9b135635298f725929451d11d5e96403be9940c&width=150&height=113", "width": 150}}, "processToken": null, "processed": false, "s3Object": null, "size": 351244, "title": "Common eiders -

storage and release of water in the Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest (PCTR) region. In particular, changes in seasonal snowcover and glacier volume have the potential to induce pronounced changes in physical and chemical hydrology. Downstream transmission of these hydrological changes will impact biological communities, in many of which population dynamics are linked to physical processes. Developing an understanding of the links between physical (hydrological) drivers and ecological trajectories will thus allow for improved science-based resource management and economic decision-making, especially with regard to economically important fish species such as herring and salmon. Additionally, as glacier retreat changes Alaska\u2019s coastal viewsheds, tourism and recreation industries will be affected, and industries dependent on reliable seasonal snowpacks, such as ski recreation, are likely to suffer if predictions of increased winter rain manifest. Our project, Ice2O, will focus on integrating several newly available data products that can be combined to allow us to begin to develop forecasting decision-making tools related to cryospheric and hydrological change throughout the PCTR. These tools, leveraging the inter-agency collaborations we have established, will ultimately help address projected climate and ecosystem changes over multiple temporal and spatial scales. \r\nIce2O will integrate climate downscaling, snow accumulation, glacier mass balance and streamflow datasets, and then use the integrated database to assess glacier sensitivity to changes in climate forcing.  We will perform the analysis at the basin scale, but integrate over the entire northern PCTR region.  The sensitivity testing will be guided by colleagues in resource management (including LCC\u2019s, USFS, NPS, BLM) and ecology (including colleagues at the UAF School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences and the USGS) in order to align our efforts with the \u201cquestions that matter\u201d, that is those with large uncertainty and/or substantial management and economic impacts. By building on an observational foundation, and by incorporating external ecosystem expertise, we will enhance model accuracy and provide relevant, accurate information on glacier change in the PCTR to to decision-makers. Our results will be presented in multiple formats to best facilitate engagement with both the science and management communities. The Ice2O team is diverse, with backgrounds in physical, chemical and biological science. We have a proven track-record of working with management, highlighting the existing and potential ecosystem-wide implications of glacier change. Each member of our team brings many other funded projects with them, allowing this project to focus on integrating a broad array of new discovery.\r\n"}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}, {"annualBudgets": [{"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds": 200000.0, "year": "2015"}], "className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet", "facetName": "Budget", "parts": [{"type": "Award Type", "value": "COA"}, {"type": "Award Number", "value": "CM4022"}], "totalFunds": 200000.0}], "files": [{"checksum": null, "contentEncoding": null, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "dateUploaded": "2016-02-16T22:32:12Z", "downloadUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/55130d9ee4b02e76d75c0778?f=__disk__55%2Fef%2F0b%2F55ef0b2898f78de7153c8f0a5a8b9b353b955913", "imageHeight": 1102, "imageWidth": 1470, "name": "AK-2015-2_MuirGlacier_BruceMolnia.jpg", "originalMetadata": false, "pathOnDisk": "__disk__55/ef/0b/55ef0b2898f78de7153c8f0a5a8b9b353b955913", "previewImage": {"large": {"height": 750, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/55130d9ee4b02e76d75c0778?f=__disk__55%2Fef%2F0b%2F55ef0b2898f78de7153c8f0a5a8b9b353b955913&width=1000&height=750", "width": 1000}, "medium": {"height": 435, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/55130d9ee4b02e76d75c0778?f=__disk__55%2Fef%2F0b%2F55ef0b2898f78de7153c8f0a5a8b9b353b955913&width=580&height=435", "width": 580}, "small": {"height": 262, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/55130d9ee4b02e76d75c0778?f=__disk__55%2Fef%2F0b%2F55ef0b2898f78de7153c8f0a5a8b9b353b955913&width=350&height=262", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 112, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/55130d9ee4b02e76d75c0778?f=__disk__55%2Fef%2F0b%2F55ef0b2898f78de7153c8f0a5a8b9b353b955913&width=150&height=112", "width": 150}}, "processToken": null, "processed": false, "s3Object": null, "size": 1149201, "title": "Muir Glacier in 2003 -

The potential impacts on economically important species such as herring and salmon are poorly understood, but we do know that the wellbeing of many species is linked to physical processes and climate. Improving our understanding of these linkages will help resource managers to make better long-term decisions with regard to managing ecosystems along the Gulf of Alaska. Other potential impacts of glacier loss include changing coastal viewsheds, which impacts tourism and recreation industries. Providing decision support to plan for these changes requires interagency collaborations, cross-disciplinary research and technical tools that enable data integration across space and time.

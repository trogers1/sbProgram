Climate change adds a layer of complexity to the planning process because of its uncertain effects on the environment. In order to make sound decisions, managers need information about how climate change will affect wildlife habitat, both on its own and in conjunction with management actions. The goal of this project was to explore how future climate may interact with management alternatives to shape wildlife habitat across large landscapes. Scientists used computer simulations [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Emilie Henderson", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "Emilie.Henderson@oregonstate.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "503-725-9956", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "James Kagan", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Institute for Natural Resources, Portland State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Megan Creutzburg", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Anita Morzillo", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Jessica Halofsky", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Miles Hemstrom", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Washington Department of Natural Resources", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59609, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Began close-out process for data.\n(9/18/2014)\nData delivered in mid-March.

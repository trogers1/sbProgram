This can happen temporarily on timescales of a season to several years to a decade or two. Natural variability is poorly described and attributed to specific causes, contributing to uncertainty and misunderstandings about the nature of climate change that stakeholders and resource managers attempt to anticipate. There exists, therefore, a need to clarify the magnitude and causality of natural climate variability. This connection needs to be explained for locally-experienced weather and particularly for daily extreme events, whose seasonal behavior impacts both resources and imagination. Conversely, it is also important [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Alexander Gershunov", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "sasha@ucsd.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "UC San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UCSD/SIO)"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "858-534-8418", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Climate, Atmospheric Science and Physical Oceanography (CASPO) Division\r\nScripps Institution of Oceanography\r\nUniversity of California, San Diego", "city": "La Jolla", "state": "CA", "zip": "92093-0224", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Suraj Polade", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "UCSD/SIO"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Noah Knowles", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS, Menlo Park"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Rupa Basu", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Cal/EPA, Oakland"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Deanna Dullen", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Devil\u2019s Postpile National Monument"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Daniel R Cayan", "oldPartyId": 1669, "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "email": "drcayan@usgs.gov", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Oceanographer", "firstName": "Daniel", "middleName": "R", "lastName": "Cayan", "organization": {"displayText": "Branch of Regional Research, Western Region"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Daniel R Cayan/WRD/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "buildingCode": "WED", "faxPhone": "8585348561", "streetAddress": {"line1": "Scripps Inst.

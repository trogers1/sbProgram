The river supplies water to approximately 36 million people, irrigates nearly six million acres of farmland within and beyond the basin, and contributes an estimated 26 billion dollars each year to the region\u2019s recreational economy. Yet the Colorado River\u2019s water supply is already fully allocated, meaning that the economic and environmental health of the region is closely tied to the river\u2019s streamflow.   Climate projections for the Southwest show a future marked by chronic drought and substantial reductions in streamflow. The region has already been impacted by climate change, experiencing warmer [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Hsin-I Chang", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "hchang@atmo.arizona.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "520-626-0358", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "1118 E 4th st, Rm 542", "city": "Tucson", "state": "AZ", "zip": "85721", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Christopher Castro", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "castro@atmo.arizona.edu", "cellPhone": "520- 626-5617", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "520- 626-5617", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Peter Troch", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "James Prairie", "oldPartyId": 56333, "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "description": "Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.", "firstName": "James", "lastName": "Prairie", "organization": {"displayText": "Bureau of Reclamation"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Jon A.

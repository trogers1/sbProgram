This is because a primary way in which species respond to climate change is by adjusting their geographic ranges to find more suitable temperatures and adequate food supplies. It is also because connectivity facilitates many other important ecological and evolutionary processes within species' ranges, further promoting resilience and healthy populations. However, widespread fragmentation of landscapes by human activities presents a serious obstacle to these processes, which may contribute to a decline in biodiversity, and subsequent [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Meade Krosby", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "mkrosby@u.washington.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "(206) 579-8023", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Department of Biology\r\nBox 351800\r\nUniversity of Washington", "city": "Seattle", "state": "WA", "zip": "98195-1800", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Amy Snover", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "UW Climate Impacts Group (UW CIG)"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Guillaume Mauger", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "UW CIG"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Robert Norheim", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "UW CIG"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Trevor Murdock", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC)"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Markus Schnorbus", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "PCIC"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Steve Sobie", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "PCIC"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Gregory Kehm", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Consultant"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "James Pepper", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Okanagan Nation Alliance (ONA)"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Jeremy Crow", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "ONA"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Tory Stevens", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "BC Parks"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Regina Rochefort", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "National Park Service"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Eric Valdal", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "David Peterson", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "National Forest Service"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Participating Agencies and Organizations of the Washington Wildlife Habitat Connectivity Working Group", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": " ", "DMP": "Approved", "Potential_Products": "1.

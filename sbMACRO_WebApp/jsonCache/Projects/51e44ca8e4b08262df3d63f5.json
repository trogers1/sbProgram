Not only has this translated into a longer fire season, but reduced snowpack has cascading effects that impact streamflow, water supplies, agricultural productivity, and ecosystems. California receives 80% of its precipitation during the winter, so mountain snowpack plays a critical role in replenishing the state\u2019s water supply.   One factor that affects the amount of winter precipitation (and therefore snowpack) in California is the North Pacific Jet (NPJ)\u2014a current of strong, high altitude winds that occur over the northern Pacific Ocean. Winters when the NPJ is located further north than normal are drier than average in California, [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Valerie  Trouet", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "trouet@ltrr.arizona.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "520-626-8004", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research\r\n1215 E.

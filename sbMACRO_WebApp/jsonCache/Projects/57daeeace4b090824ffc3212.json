As water levels drop, some small streams become fragmented, transforming from a ribbon of continuous habitat into a series of isolated pools. Fragmented streams may pose a serious threat to salmon. For example, juveniles that become stranded in small pools are at increased risk to overheat, starve, or be consumed by predators.  Healthy salmon populations can cope with fragmentation and recover from a bad drought-year. However, many salmon populations are endangered and face long-term drought. Land and resource managers are increasingly finding endangered salmon stranded [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Jonathan Armstrong", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "jonathan.armstrong@oregonstate.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "541-840-6017", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Department of Fisheries and Wildlife\r\n104 Nash Hall\r\n2820 SW Campus Way", "city": "Corvallis", "state": "OR", "zip": "97333", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Thomas Buehrens", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "thomas.buehrens@dfw.wa.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "null", "city": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null", "country": "null"}}}, {"name": "James Dixon", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "james.dixon@noaa.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "null", "city": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null", "country": "null"}}}, {"name": "Kale Bentley", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "Kale.Bentley@dfw.wa.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "null", "city": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null", "country": "null"}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "10/6/16 - Contacted regarding DMP.\n10/31/16 - DMP Editor auto notification triggered the PI to update and submit.

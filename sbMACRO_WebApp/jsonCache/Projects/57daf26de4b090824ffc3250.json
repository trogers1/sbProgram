They provide natural places for recreation, clean drinking water, and important habitats for fish and wildlife. However, the warmer temperatures and harsher droughts in the west that are related to climate change are causing die-offs of many trees. Outbreaks of insects, like the mountain pine beetle, that kill trees are also more likely in warmer, drier conditions.  To maintain healthy and functioning forest ecosystems, one action forest managers can take is to make management decisions that will help forests adapt to future climate change. However, adaptation is a process based on genetic change and few tools are currently available for managers to use to incorporate genetic [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Diana Six", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "diana.six@cfc.umt.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "The University of Montana"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "406 531 1813", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "32 Campus Drive, Dept.

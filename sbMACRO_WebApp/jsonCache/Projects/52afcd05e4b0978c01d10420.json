Warming temperatures in spring can reduce snow-fed flows, with serious implications for the water supplies that support communities and wildlife. While it is already well-known that precipitation has a significant influence on river flow, recent observations suggest that temperature and the amount of water in soil may also influence streamflow. In the face of a changing climate, it is important that resource managers understand how factors such as changing temperatures and precipitation will affect this vital water source.  To address this need, researchers are examining records of streamflow, temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation in the upper [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Connie Woodhouse", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "conniew1@email.arizona.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "520-626-0235", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "412 Harvill Building, Box #2\r\nUniversity of Arizona", "city": "Tucson", "state": "AZ", "zip": "85721", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Gregory Pederson", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "gpederson@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "4069947390", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "2327 University Way, Suite 2", "city": "Bozeman", "state": "MT", "zip": "59715", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Adam Csank", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "adamc@nipissingu.ca", "organization": {"displayText": "Nipissing University"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "+1 (705) 474-3450 ext: 4023", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "100 College Drive", "city": "North Bay", "state": "Ontario", "zip": "P1B 8L7", "country": "Canada"}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "DMP": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Potential_Products": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

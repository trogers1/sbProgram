These managers need state-of-the-art, scientifically based information upon which to base these management plans and decisions consistently across California and the Great Basin. This project will apply historical, current, and projected climate data to a regional water model to examine water availability, biodiversity, and conservation. Analysis of this climate and hydrology data will help managers understand areas in the region and landscape where the effects of climate change are expected to be the most profound. The study will also address how the environment is likely [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Lorraine Flint", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "lflint@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), California Water Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "916-278-3223", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Alan Flint", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS, California Water Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Michael J Moran", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS, Nevada Water Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "John Dingman", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Bren School for the Environment, University of California"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "James H Thorne", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Information Center for the Environment, University of California"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Lisa Micheli", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Dwight Center for Conservation Science at Pepperwood"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Healy Hamilton", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of California, Berkeley"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Stuart Weiss", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Bay Area Open Space Council"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Bridget Thrasher", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Climate Analytics Group"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Claudia Tebaldi", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Climate Analytics Group"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Deanne DiPietro", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Sonoma Ecology Center and California Climate Commons"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Grant Ballard", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "PRBO Conservation Science"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Sam Veloz", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "PRBO Conservation Science"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59610, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "DMP": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Potential_Products": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

In the Southwest, where the temperature and precipitation changes from climate change are expected to be particularly severe, tribal communities may be especially vulnerable. Through this project, researchers sought to better understand the climate change threats facing the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of northwestern Nevada. Researchers found that the Tribe\u2019s vulnerability to climate change stems from its dependence on Pyramid Lake, which may experience reduced water supply in the future. This will potentially have negative consequences [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Karletta Chief", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "kchief@email.arizona.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "520-626-5598", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59610, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Aleix Serrat-Capdevila", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "William J.

Many federal, state and local agencies use stream insects to monitor the health of freshwater ecosystems. While the temperature ranges for some insects are often inferred from the temperature of the waters where they were collected, this inference is coarse at best and problematic at worst. Stream temperatures fluctuate a lot during the year and temperature may or may not control where an insect lives. Field insects were collected and sent to a laboratory for testing several temperature endpoints, particularly at higher temperatures. Respiration, breathing rate, and some physical activities were expected to increase, [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Robert W Black", "oldPartyId": 866, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "rwblack@usgs.gov", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Chief Supervisory Hydrologist", "firstName": "Robert", "middleName": "W", "lastName": "Black", "organization": {"displayText": "Washington Water Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Robert W Black/WRD/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "buildingCode": "WWT", "faxPhone": "2535521581", "streetAddress": {"line1": "934 Broadway, Suite 300", "city": "Tacoma", "state": "WA", "zip": "98402", "country": "US"}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "934 Broadway, Suite 300", "city": "Tacoma", "state": "WA", "zip": "98402", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Susan B.

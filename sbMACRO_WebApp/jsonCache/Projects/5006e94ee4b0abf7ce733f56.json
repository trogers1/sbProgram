Will they be stable or unstable? Will the waters be cold and clear or warm and muddy? Will they have salmon or other species? These questions motivated our two-year study of climate warming effects on headwater streams draining the Cascade Mountains. Using a novel combination of snow, geohydrology, and sediment transport models we assessed the vulnerability of stream channels to changing peak streamflow. Our snow modeling shows that with just a 2\u00b0C warming, snowfall shifts to rainfall at all elevations, peak snowpacks occur over two months earlier, and snowpacks are reduced by over half of historical values. Our geohydrology modeling shows that greater rainfall [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Anne Nolin", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "nolina@geo.oregonstate.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "541-737-8051", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Gordon Grant", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Mohammad Safeeq", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Sarah L Lewis", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Jason B Dunham", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS, Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Marshall Gannett", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS, Oregon Water Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Christina Tague", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of California, Santa Barbara"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Karl Morgenstern", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Eugene Water and Electric Board"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Mark Kramer", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Brian Staab", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Setting up account for Sarah Lewis and Matt Cooper to upload to ScienceBase.\n(4/2/2015)\nThis data is supposed to be in netCDF form which generally goes to CIDA.  It remains to be seen what the actual format/size of the data is.\n(4/10/2015)\nDuring the week of March 30-Apr 2, Sarah and Matt were given access to begin uploading to ScienceBase directly.  Metadata is begin produced via questionnaire.  I will convert the questionnaires to XML files.\nThey are now beginning to upload data to SB.\n(4/17/2015)\nWe\u2019ve received some, but not all snowmodel output.  We\u2019ve received RHESSys output.  No sign of the other data.  Contacted Lewis, Cooper, and Nolin on 5/01.\n(5/01/2015)\nNumerous back and forth with this project regarding their data.  Added Laura Hempel to the folder to upload data.  Answered a series of formatting questions of Cooper.  Still waiting for the upload.\n(5/15/2015)\nHempel uploaded data. Cooper has been in contact with Dave Blodgett who is awaiting Cooper\u2019s netCDF data.  Cooper has access to a datastore on NKN which will be exposed over the web so Blodgett can download it.\n(5/29/2015)\nCooper had some metadata/transfer-related questions over the past week but nothing new was sent along\n(6/11/2015)\nRequesting CSC director to get involved. No response on data since mid-May.\n(6/25/2015)\n7/10 \u2013 Cooper uploaded his netCDF data to NKN.  Dave Blodgett, CIDA, downloaded the data on 7/7.  He is currently processing it for storage on the GeoData Portal, and will eventually generate a ScienceBase record for it.  Cooper uploaded three sets of data \u2013SWE maps, GIS data, and descriptions.  It looks to be all the products, but I\u2019m working through them to verify that they do constitute the complete set.\n7/24 \u2013 I have received everything from this, and am still working through it.\n9/11 \u2013 Snow model output is at CIDA and in process to be released. \n11/19 - All data has been uploaded and released via ScienceBase.  CIDA is working through an issue with the Cooper netCDF; should be resolved soon.  Via Dave:  \"One big thing to note is that while generating ScienceBase metadata, we found something wrong with the Cooper snow model and are working on a fix so it is no longer out on production servers. It is still visible on test: http://cida-test.er.usgs.gov/thredds/catalog.html\"", "DMP": "Approved", "Potential_Products": "1. Channel reach surveys from total station\n2. Stream Gage Data\n3.

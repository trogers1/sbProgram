Information on hydrologic factors \u2013 such as streamflow, snowpack, and soil moisture \u2013 is important for understanding and predicting wildfire risk, flood activity, and agricultural and rangeland productivity, among others.   Existing tools for modeling hydrologic conditions rely on information on temperature and precipitation. This project sought to evaluate different methods for downscaling global climate models \u2013 that is, taking information produced at a global scale and making it useable at a regional scale, in order to produce more accurate projections of temperature and precipitation for the Pacific Northwest.

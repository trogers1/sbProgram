However, climate change is causing lower and warmer summer stream flows that could decimate these fish populations. Aquatic cold-water habitats are further threatened by stormwater runoff, which moves from streets to storm drains and then is often discharged into cold-water rivers and streams. The urban heat island effect (when cities and urban areas are warmer than surrounding rural areas) may heat the temperature of the runoff and if the runoff is very warm, it could tip salmon habitat into fatal conditions.  However, specifically how urban warming \u2013 or cooling, such as by tree shade \u2013 affects [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Kevan Moffett", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "kevan.moffett@wsu.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "Washington State University Vancouver"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "(360) 546-9413", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "14204 NE Salmon Creek Ave., VSCI Suite 230", "city": "Vancouver", "state": "WA", "zip": "98686", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "10/6/16 - Contacted regarding DMP.\n10/27/16 - Responded requesting clarification on what to do.\n10/28/16 - I replied with the basics.

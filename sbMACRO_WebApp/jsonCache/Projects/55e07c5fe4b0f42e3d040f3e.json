Mapping Wetland Hydrology Across an Ecoregion and Developing Climate Adaptation Recommendations", "URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55e07c5fe4b0f42e3d040f3e", "summary": "As the impacts of climate change amplify, understanding the consequences for wetland dynamics will be critical for their sustainable management and conservation, particularly in arid regions such as the Columbia Plateau ecoregion. However, the data to model climate impacts to wetland ecosystems has been hampered by the lack of accurate maps showing their spatial distribution and data on their historical hydrological dynamics. Though these data may exist for particular wetlands, there are no wall-to-wall consistent datasets of wetland location and long-term hydrological dynamics. Climate change has emphasized the growing need to plan conservation actions across large landscapes and at longer-term time scales. As such, consistent datasets [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Monika Moskal", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "lmmoskal@uw.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Sonia Hall", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "SAH Ecologia LLC"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Mike Rule", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Meghan Halabisky", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "mhalabisky@gmail.com", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "GNLCC is administering and responsible for data (Per N.D. on 9/1/2015)\n6/12/17 - Gus et al. are looking to close this by end of June 2017.  Asked me to verify that data/metadata is up to our expectations.\n6/15/17 - Sean Finn passed us a note saying that everything had been approved and recieved by the GNLCC.  On looking at the SB record for the project, I found a Data and Documents folder.  The Data folder contained a geodatabase and a map package.  Neither had extensive metadata in the SB record.  On looking at the gdb, I didn't see metadata.  On requesting this, Sean replied that there was metadata on the gdb.  I adjusted the settings on ArcMap (from FGDC to Item Description to ISO to FGDC) and somehow the metadata was read and displayed.  I approved the project under our policy.  Even though we are not tracking this, I was asked to verify the data/metadata was in good order by Gus.", "DMP": "n/a", "Potential_Products": "unknown", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

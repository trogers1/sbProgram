Cheatgrass is highly flammable, and as it has expanded, the extent and frequency of fire in the Great Basin has increased by as much as 200%. These changes in fire regimes are associated with loss of the native sagebrush, grasses, and herbaceous flowering plants that provide habitat for many native animals, including Greater Sage-Grouse. Changes in vegetation and fire management have been suggested with the intent of conserving Greater Sage-Grouse. However, the potential responses of other sensitive-status birds to these changes in management have not been well [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Erica Fleishman", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "efleishman@ucdavis.edu", "active": true, "firstName": "Erica", "lastName": "Fleishman", "organization": {"displayText": "University of California, Davis"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Jennifer Balch", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Colorado, Boulder"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Bethany Bradley", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "jobTitle": "Assistant Professor", "firstName": "Bethany", "lastName": "Bradley", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Massachusetts, Amherst"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Bethany Bradley/UMASS - Location", "description": "Bethany Bradley studies how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to anthropogenic disturbance and climate change, primarily focusing on non-native invasive plants, with a goal of better understanding the biogeography of invasion risk.", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "318 Holdsworth Hall", "line2": "Environmental Conservation, University of Massachusetts", "city": "Amherst", "state": "MA", "zip": "01003", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Todd Hopkins", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "active": true, "firstName": "Todd", "lastName": "Hopkins", "organization": {"displayText": "Great Basin Landscape Conservation Cooperative"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Ned Horning", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "American Museum of Natural History"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Matthias Leu", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "active": true, "firstName": "Matthias", "lastName": "Leu", "organization": {"displayText": "College of William and Mary"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Ralph Mac Nally", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Canberra"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Mike Pellant", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Rangeland Ecologist", "firstName": "Mike", "lastName": "Pellant", "organization": {"displayText": "Bureau of Land Management"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Mike Pellant/BLM.GOV - Location", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Bureau of Land Management Idaho State Office", "line2": "1387 S Vinnell Way", "city": "Boise", "state": "Idaho", "zip": "3823", "country": "United States"}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "JSFP is administering and responsible for the data (Per E.F. on 9/28/15)", "DMP": "No Info Provided", "Potential_Products": "No Info Provided", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

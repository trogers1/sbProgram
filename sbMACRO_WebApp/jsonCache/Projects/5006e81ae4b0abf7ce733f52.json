Over the past century, however, populations have dramatically declined due to habitat loss, overharvest, and invasive species. Consequently, many populations are listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Complicating these stressors is global warming and associated climate change. Overall, aquatic ecosystems across the PNW are predicted to experience increasingly earlier snowmelt in the spring, reduced late spring and summer flows, increased winter flooding, warmer and drier summers, increased water temperatures, [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Clint C Muhlfeld", "oldPartyId": 7265, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "cmuhlfeld@usgs.gov", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Aquatic Ecologist", "firstName": "Clint", "middleName": "C", "lastName": "Muhlfeld", "cellPhone": "4066009686", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Clint C Muhlfeld/BRD/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "building": "USGS Building", "buildingCode": "KKF", "faxPhone": "4068887923", "streetAddress": {"line1": "USGS Building, Park Headquarters", "city": "West Glacier", "state": "MT", "zip": "59936-0128", "country": "US"}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "USGS Building, Park Headquarters", "city": "West Glacier", "state": "MT", "zip": "59936-0128", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Gordon Luikart", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "gordon.luikart@umontana.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "The University of Montana"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "406-982-3301 x249", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Tim Beechie", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "John Duffield", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "The University of Montana"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Leslie A Jones", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS, Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "John Kimball", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "The University of Montana"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Erin Landguth", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "The University of Montana"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Gregory Pederson", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS, Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Jack Stanford", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "The University of Montana"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Robin Waples", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "NOAA Fisheries"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59609, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Size of files may determine archival location.\n(8/11/2014)\nBegan close-out process for data.\n(9/18/2014)\nReceived data Dec. 2014.

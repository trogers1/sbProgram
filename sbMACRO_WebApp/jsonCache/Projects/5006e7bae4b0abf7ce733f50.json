Unfortunately, not only are these valuable ecosystems understudied compared to others, but they are also among the most sensitive to climate change. Climate change threatens wetlands by altering temperature and precipitation, which cause changes in water level and water temperature. Due to this threat, the international community and domestic agencies alike have highlighted the need to better understand wetlands in the face of climate change, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to the Ramsar Convention, to the National [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Alan Hamlet", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Michael C Adams", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Geological Survey, Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Wendy J Palen", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Simon Fraser University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "L.

At high elevations, headwater streams fared no better, with numerous streams experiencing periods of \u201cno flow\u201d for the first time in recorded history. These periods of low to no water flow can cause major water availability problems for wildlife and human communities, especially if they are not anticipated.  In order for land and resource managers to anticipate and prepare for future droughts, they need scientific information on [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Kyle Blasch", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "kblasch@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "Idaho Water Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "2083871321", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "230 Collins Road", "city": "Boise", "state": "ID", "zip": "83702", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Thomas Sando", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "tsando@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "Montana Water Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "4064575953", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "3162 Bozeman Ave", "city": "Helena", "state": "MT", "zip": "59601-6456", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Jason Dunham", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "jdunham@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Corvallis Research Group, FRESC"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "5417500990", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "3200 S.W.

Question on whether they should have two DMPs for two different project \"tasks\".  I replied that it doesn't really matter, we can include all on this DMP.  DMP approved.\n12/13/16 - Had a call with Sando/Hockman-Wert.  Numerous questions on interpreting the DMP and how/where they will handle approx. 1TB of Continuous Parameter Grids.  Also - there's two parts to the project (which may look disjointed on the DMP) one part is HIP, the other part is a citizen science component.\n12/7/17 - Checked in w/ Dave H.-W.

Warming temperatures, clearly documented in climate records for the Colorado River basin, are having an impact on the amount of annual streamflow yielded from rain and snow. Recent work has revealed that warming temperatures have played an increasingly important role over the past decades, both exacerbating droughts and dampening the effects of wet winters on high stream flows. Understanding and anticipating how warming temperatures will influence future water supply in the Colorado River basin is increasingly important for resource management, particularly in light of recent drought conditions.   The overarching goals of this project are to better [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Connie Woodhouse", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "conniew1@email.arizona.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "520-626-0235", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "School of Geography and Development, 1064 E.

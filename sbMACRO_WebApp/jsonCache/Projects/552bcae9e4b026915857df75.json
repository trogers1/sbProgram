Hydrologic and ecological processes, such as groundwater fluctuations and riparian evapotranspiration, can be tightly coupled. Ideally, managers would have tools and models that include all processes to better understand how each management action would propagate through the environment. Because resources are limited, management tools that include only the most important processes may be more realistic. However, in some cases, omitting some interactions can lead to significant errors in predictions of hydrologic outcomes and ecological function, severely limiting a manager\u2019s ability to identify how restoration and [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Paul Ferre", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "tyferre@gmail.com", "organization": {"displayText": "Hydrology and Water Resources, University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "520 621 2952", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "1133 E James E Rogers Way", "city": "Tucson", "state": "AZ", "zip": "85721-0011", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Jesse Dickinson", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "jdickins@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "Hydrologic Investigations and Research Section"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "5206706671306", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "520 N.

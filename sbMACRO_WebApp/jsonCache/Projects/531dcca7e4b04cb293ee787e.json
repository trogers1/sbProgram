Many species are moving in directions and at rates that correspond with recent climatic change. Understanding how species distributions and abundances are likely to be altered can inform management and planning activities resulting in more robust management. We projected climate-driven changes in the abundances and distributions of 31 focal bird species in Oregon and Washington using the latest downscaled CMIP5 climate projections and corresponding vegetation model outputs. We mapped these future projections and integrated them into an existing web-based tool (http://data.pointblue.org/apps/nwcsc/) to allow managers and planners to access and download the projections.

There are a few other datasets - DVGM, climate exposure maps, Regional GAP analysis that needs clarification.\n8/3/16 - Case checked with John Kim on the DVGM.  Kim is going to publish the data via the USFS.  Waiting on the others.\n1/4/17 - Found that the remaining data was accessible but the links on the webpage were broken. Using wget against the link URLs, we were able to access the data.  Uploaded to SB.", "DMP": "Approved", "Potential_Products": "1. Avian distribution maps\n2. Digital Vegetation projections\n3.

Rising temperatures, decreased snowpack, and earlier snowmelt are expected to lead to longer fire seasons, dryer fuel, and an increase in the area burned by wildfires in the future. Forest managers therefore need information on how wildfire patterns and forests will change as the climate warms, in order to guide management activities that can sustain the important ecosystem services that forests provide \u2013 including timber production, carbon storage, improved water quality, and recreational opportunities.   To address this need, researchers will develop a state-of-the [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Brian Harvey", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "bjharvey@uw.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "650-521-1988", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "University of Washington, School of Environmental and Forest Sciences Box 352100 University of Washington", "city": "Seattle", "state": "WA", "zip": "98195", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "David Peterson", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "wild@uw.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "USFS"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "null", "city": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null", "country": "null"}}}, {"name": "Jessica Halofsky", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "jhalo@uw.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "null", "city": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null", "country": "null"}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "6/29/17 - Project approved.

As the western population is projected to grow by 310 million people by 2100, this will potentially increase demand for diminishing supplies if housing growth occurs in rangelands or forested lands. Understanding watershed vulnerabilities due to changing climate, fire regime, and [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Jason R Kreitler", "oldPartyId": 13836, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "jkreitler@usgs.gov", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Geographer", "personalTitle": "Mr.", "firstName": "Jason", "middleName": "R", "lastName": "Kreitler", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Western Geographic Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Jason R Kreitler/GEOG/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "building": "Snake River Field Station", "buildingCode": "WID", "officePhone": "2084265217", "streetAddress": {"line1": "970 Lusk Street", "city": "Boise", "state": "ID", "zip": "83706"}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "970 Lusk Street", "city": "Boise", "state": "ID", "zip": "83706", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Joel B Sankey", "oldPartyId": 24174, "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "jsankey@usgs.gov", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Research Geologist", "firstName": "Joel", "middleName": "B", "lastName": "Sankey", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Southwest Geographic Science Team"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Joel B Sankey/GEOG/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "building": "Bldgs.4And5", "buildingCode": "WZD", "officePhone": "9285567289", "faxPhone": "9285567100", "streetAddress": {"line1": "2255 North Gemini Drive", "city": "Flagstaff", "state": "AZ", "zip": "86001"}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "2255 North Gemini Drive, Mail Stop 150", "mailStopCode": "150", "city": "Flagstaff", "state": "AZ", "zip": "86001", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Todd J Hawbaker", "oldPartyId": 12013, "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "tjhawbaker@usgs.gov", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "firstName": "Todd", "middleName": "J", "lastName": "Hawbaker", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Todd J Hawbaker/GEOG/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "building": "DFC Bldg 25", "buildingCode": "KAE", "officePhone": "3032361371", "faxPhone": "3032365349", "streetAddress": {"line1": "W 6th Ave Kipling St", "city": "Lakewood", "state": "CO", "zip": "80225"}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 516", "mailStopCode": "516", "city": "Denver", "state": "CO", "zip": "80225-0046", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Nicole Vaillant", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Forest Service"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Scott Lowe", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Boise State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "DMP Complete.\n4/29/16 - Contacted Kreitler regarding data products.\n5/24/16 - Kreitler responded that this was \"on his radar\" as he looked for reviewers for datasets.\n7/26/16 - No further response on followups.\n5/19/17 - Betsy has contacted to verify status of project in FSP.\n6/12/17 - Kreitler replied that the FSP process is still ongoing, just waiting on final data approval.", "DMP": "Approved", "Potential_Products": "1.

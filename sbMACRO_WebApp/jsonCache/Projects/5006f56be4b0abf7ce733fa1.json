In addition to the current threats to habitat, each 1 degree celsius increase in temperature due to climate change is expected to result in an additional 87,000 km2 of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) that will be converted to unsuitable habitat for sage-grouse. Thus, the future distribution and composition of sagebrush landscapes is likely to differ greatly from today\u2019s configuration. We conducted a large, multi-objective project to identify: (1) characteristics of habitats required by sage-grouse, [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Steven T Knick", "oldPartyId": 5573, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "steve_knick@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Geological Survey, Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "208-426-5208", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Sara J Oyler-McCance", "oldPartyId": 7797, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "saray-oyler-mccance@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Geological Survey Fort Collins Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "970-226-9197", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59609, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Through discussion, it was agreed that no usable data was produced in this project. \n(5/8/14)", "DMP": "None", "Potential_Products": "n/a", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

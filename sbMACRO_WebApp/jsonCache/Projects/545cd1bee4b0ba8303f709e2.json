The project\u2019s products are tailored towards the Arid Lands Initiative (ALI) conservation goals and objectives and provide the foundation for adaptation to a changing climate. We adopted a \u201czoned\u201d approach to identifying focal areas, connectivity management zones, and zones for riparian habitat and ecological representation. Through a series of workshops and webinars, the ALI identified freshwater species for targeted conservation, including Pacific lamprey, bull trout, redband trout, riparian birds and waterfowl, and beavers. The methods to spatially identify a conservation design in pursuit of the ALI\u2019s [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Tom Miewald", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "tom_miewald@fws.gov", "active": true, "firstName": "Tom", "lastName": "Miewald", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Great Northern LCC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "John Pierce", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "dwight.pierce@dfw.wa.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Sonia Hall", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "hallsoniawild@gmail.com", "organization": {"displayText": "SAH Ecologia LLC"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "David M Theobald", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "description": "Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.", "firstName": "David", "middleName": "M", "lastName": "Theobald", "organization": {"displayText": "Conservation Science Partners"}}], "history": "4/317 - Miewald posted data products to the GNLCC record in SB.

Winters are expected to become wetter and summers could become drier. Snowpack will likely decrease substantially, and snowmelt runoff may occur earlier in the year. Wildfires are projected to become more frequent and severe, and forest types are expected to change from maritime evergreen to subtropical mixed-woodlands.   Because the impacts of climate change vary from place to place, regionally-specific climate projections are critical to help farmers, foresters, city planners, public utility providers, and fish and wildlife managers plan for how to best manage resources. However, the models that are used to project changes in climate are produced at [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Philip Mote", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "pmote@coas.oregonstate.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "541-913-2274", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "John Abatzoglou", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Dennis P Lettenmaier", "oldPartyId": 50471, "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "David Turner", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "David E Rupp", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Dominique Bachelet", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Conservation Biology Institute"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Nicholas Coops", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of British Columbia"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "John Kim", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Forest Service"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59609, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "NOAA\u2019s Climate Impacts Research Consortium", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Tim Sheehan", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"directoryId": "23458", "displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Ken Ferschweiler", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Conservation Biology Institute"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Katherine Hegewisch", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Bart Nijssen", "oldPartyId": 52196, "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "description": "Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.", "firstName": "Bart", "lastName": "Nijssen", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Geological Survey"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Matt Stumbaugh", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Per email of 7/29/2014, nearly all datasets are complete.  #5 is not complete - seeking clarification.

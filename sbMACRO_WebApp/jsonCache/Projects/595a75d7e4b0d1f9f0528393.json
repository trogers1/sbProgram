The diversity of plants and animals, as well as high rates of endemism, make the area a biodiversity hotspot. High diversity in plant and animal species contributes greatly to the health and productivity of ecosystems, and plays an important role in the local and state economy (e.g. tourism, food crops, etc.).   San Diego County's complex topography, highly variable precipitation and climate play a large role in determining the biology of the region. Changing temperatures and precipitation patterns due to climate change would alter the region's climate and add to other stressors such as habitat fragmentation from roadways [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Daniel Cayan", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "cayandr@gmail.com", "organization": {"displayText": "Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "8585344507", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "201 Nierenberg Hall, Scripps Institution of Oceanography", "city": "La Jolla", "state": "CA", "zip": "92093-0224", "country": "United States"}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "DMP": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Potential_Products": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

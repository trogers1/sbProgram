Climate envelope models have been used to predict population trends and future distributions, but the reliability of such predictions remains relatively unknown; without tests of model accuracy, policy development will be based on highly uncertain ground. Our team assembled recent developments in change detection mapping and species modeling. Specifically, our objectives were to: (1) use 32-year data on bird distributions to test the reliability of climate envelope models, (2) test whether changes in climate are linked [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Matthew Betts", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "matthew.betts@oregonstate.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "541-737-3841", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Susan Shirley", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "susan.shirley@oregonstate.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "541-737-6561", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Joan Hagar", "oldPartyId": 4072, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "joan_hagar@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Geological Survey Forest & Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "541-750-0984", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59609, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Data is being moved to the Northwest Knowledge Network temporarily to pull the data together due to storage space issues.

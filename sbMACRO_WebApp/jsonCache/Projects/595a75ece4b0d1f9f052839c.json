Coastal wetlands provide essential ecosystem services to people, including flood protection from high tides and storm surges, commercial fisheries, carbon sequestration, improved water quality, and wildlife food and habitat. Coastal wetlands are also home to hundreds of migratory and resident wildlife species including threatened and endangered species of management concern. Wetlands also have the unique ability to increase their elevation relative to sea-level rise, therefore protecting nearby communities from flooding. In California, prolonged drought and extreme storm events are projected to [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Karen Thorne", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "San Francisco Bay Estuary Field Station, WERC"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "9165022996", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "505 Azuar Drive", "city": "Vallejo", "state": "CA", "zip": "94592", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "DMP": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Potential_Products": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

Cheatgrass dominated areas experience more fires that burn more land than in native ecosystems, resulting in economic and resource losses. Therefore, the reduced production, or absence, of cheatgrass in previously invaded areas during years of adequate precipitation could be seen as a windfall. However, this cheatgrass dieoff phenomenon creates other problems for land managers like accelerated soil erosion, loss of early spring food supply for livestock and wildlife, and unknown recovery pathways. We used satellite data and scientific techniques to map [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Bruce K Wylie", "oldPartyId": 11505, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "wylie@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Geological Survey Earth Resources Observation and Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "605-594-6078", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Stephen Boyte", "oldPartyId": 14527, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "sboyte@usgs.gov", "active": true, "firstName": "Stephen", "lastName": "Boyte", "organization": {"displayText": "Earth Resources Observation and Science"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Stephen Boyte/GEOG/CONT/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "building": "EROS - Mundt Federal Building", "buildingCode": "KMN", "officePhone": "6055946171", "streetAddress": {"line1": "47914 252Nd Street", "city": "Sioux Falls", "state": "SD", "zip": "57198"}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "47914 252nd Street", "city": "Sioux Falls", "state": "SD", "zip": "57198-9801", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Donald Major", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "donald_major@blm.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "Bureau of Land Management Idaho and Great Basin Restoration Initiative"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59609, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "DMP": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Potential_Products": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

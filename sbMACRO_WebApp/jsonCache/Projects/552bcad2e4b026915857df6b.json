The region depends on winter rain and snow to replenish the river basins\u2019 water supply. Atmospheric rivers \u2013 long, narrow channels in the atmosphere that carry water vapor from the Pacific Ocean \u2013 supply a substantial portion of this winter precipitation. While atmospheric rivers are critical for maintaining water resources and preventing drought, they occasionally cause extreme storms that lead to flooding. Scientists project that climate change will affect the intensity and frequency of atmospheric rivers [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Francina Dominguez", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "francina@atmo.arizona.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "5206214652", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Physics-Atmospheric Sciences Bldg, \r\n1118 E 4th St., PO Box 210081", "city": "Tucson", "state": "AZ", "zip": "85721", "country": "U.S.A"}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Juan Valdes", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Eleonora Demaria", "oldPartyId": 68782, "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "email": "edemaria@email.arizona.edu", "active": true, "firstName": "Eleonora", "lastName": "Demaria", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "The White Mountain Apache Tribe", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "The Nature Conservancy", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "City of Chandler", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "City of Peoria", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Salt River Project", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Henry F.

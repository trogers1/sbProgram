Low rainfall and record high temperatures resulted in increased tree mortality and complete forest diebacks across the West. Though land managers scrambled to respond, they lacked information needed to make informed decisions. Focusing on California\u2019s central and southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, this project seeks to determine whether a key forest management practice \u2013 forest thinning via prescribed fire \u2013 can help forests better survive drought.   Prescribed fire is commonly used in the western U.S. to remove potential wildfire fuel, such as small trees and shrubs. It is also thought that this act of selectively removing trees helps remaining trees [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "James Thorne", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "jhthorne@ucdavis.edu", "organization": {"directoryId": "24303", "displayText": "University of California, Davis"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "530-752-4389", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Dept.

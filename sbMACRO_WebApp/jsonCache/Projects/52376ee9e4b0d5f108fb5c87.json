This project was a direct response to tribal concerns about the loss of culturally significant plants from tribal gathering areas. Researchers conducted interviews with elders from the Port Gamble S\u2019Klallam Tribe to identify eight plants of key cultural concern [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Jesse Ford", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "Jesse.Ford@oregonstate.edu", "firstName": "Jesse", "lastName": "Ford", "organization": {"directoryId": "23458", "displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {"line1": "Dept.

The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe (PLPT) in Nevada is profoundly connected physically, culturally, and spiritually to Pyramid Lake, the endangered cui-\u00adui fish, and the threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout. While the tribe has adapted to non-\u00adclimatic stressors over the past century, climate change impacts to water resources pose a threat to the ecosystems and species of fish so deeply important to the PLPT. Our previous research indicates that PLPT is an exemplary leader in adaptive planning, given that tribal members are keenly aware [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Karletta Chief", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Edward Schuyler Chew", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "DMP": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Potential_Products": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

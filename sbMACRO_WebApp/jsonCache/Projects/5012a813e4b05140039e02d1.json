In fact, fire management is the largest single expenditure of land management funds on federal lands. Now, climate change is altering wildfire patterns. Climate change in the West is creating warmer and drier conditions, resulting in an increase in the amount of dead vegetation available to fuel fires.   This project seeks to assess the vulnerability of forests in the southwestern U.S. to climate change and wildfire, in order to understand how these ecosystems might become altered as a result. Researchers will examine (a) how climate change will impact wildfires in the region, to better understand fire risk; (b) identify where and [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Mark W.

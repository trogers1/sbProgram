Climate change is expected to significantly alter the ecology of the Columbia River Basin, and tribal communities will be especially sensitive to these changes, including possible loss of culturally and economically significant foods such as salmon, deer, root plants, and berries.   The purpose of this project was to assess the capacity of tribal communities and organizations in the Columbia River Basin to prepare for and respond to climate change. Researchers surveyed 15 tribes and three inter-tribal organizations [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Donald Sampson", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "don@seventhgenerationllc.com", "organization": {"displayText": "Tribal Leadership Forum"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "DMP": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Potential_Products": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Received_Products": {"Items": {"Project_Item_List": [], "Project_Item_Count": 0}, "Files": {"Project_File_Count": 0, "Project_File_List": []}}}

The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "John Y Takekawa", "oldPartyId": 10196, "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Scientist Emeritus", "personalTitle": "Dr.", "firstName": "John", "middleName": "Y", "lastName": "Takekawa", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Western Ecological Research Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "John Y Takekawa/BRD/USGS/DOI -

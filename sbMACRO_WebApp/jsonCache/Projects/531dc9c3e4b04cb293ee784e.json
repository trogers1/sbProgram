However, the benefits provided by these ecosystems may be at risk as changing climate magnifies existing stressors and allows new stressors to emerge. Preparation for and response to these potential changes can be most effectively addressed through multi-stakeholder partnerships, evaluating vulnerability of important resources to climate change, and developing response and preparation strategies for managing key natural resources in a changing world. This project will support climate-smart conservation and management across forests of northern Idaho and western Montana [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Jessi Kershner", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "jessi@ecoadapt.org", "active": true, "firstName": "Jessi", "lastName": "Kershner", "organization": {"displayText": "EcoAdapt"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "206-696-6856", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Andrea Woodward", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "awoodward@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Forest & Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Alicia Torregrosa", "oldPartyId": 10474, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "atorregrosa@usgs.gov", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Physical Scientist", "firstName": "Alicia", "lastName": "Torregrosa", "cellPhone": "6502695044", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Western Geographic Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Alicia Torregrosa/GEOG/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "building": "Bldg. 3", "buildingCode": "WMC", "faxPhone": "6503294429", "streetAddress": {"line1": "345 Middlefield Road", "city": "Menlo Park", "state": "CA", "zip": "94025-3561", "country": "US"}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "345 Middlefield Road, Mail Stop 531", "mailStopCode": "531", "city": "Menlo Park", "state": "CA", "zip": "94025", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Lara Hansen", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "EcoAdapt"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "DMP Complete.\n2/16/17 - Pinged by Nicole to followup regarding this project.\n3/6/17 - Kershner provided examples of the output, which are pdf tables and a guidebook.

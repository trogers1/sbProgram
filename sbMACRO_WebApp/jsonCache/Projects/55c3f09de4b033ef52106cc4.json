The project will identify the regional ecological and social costs and benefits of both immediate hydrologic modifications (low-profile constructed dams) and longer-term restoration of beavers (Castor canadensis) to these landscapes. Use of these techniques by ranchers and managers of public lands depends on these costs and benefits as well as social context and attitudes; the project will assess these as well. Finally, implementation of hydrologic modifications depends on communication of benefits and costs to stakeholders who may choose to implement these modifications.", "contacts": [{"name": "Susan Charnley", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Hannah Gosnell", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Gordon Grant", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Justin Huntington", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Desert Research Institute"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "David Pilliod", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "dpilliod@usgs.gov", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Supervisory Research Ecologist", "firstName": "David", "lastName": "Pilliod", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "David Pilliod/BRD/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "building": "Snake River Field Station", "buildingCode": "WID", "streetAddress": {"line1": "970 Lusk Street", "city": "Boise", "state": "ID", "zip": "83706"}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "970 Lusk Street", "city": "Boise", "state": "ID", "zip": "83706", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "2/17/16 \u2013 Charnley/Gosnell provided a response to my request that they complete their DMP.

The species is listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, but climate warming may place the species at further risk. Climate warming may lead to warming of streams in summer and increasing probability of floods in winter, leading to widespread loss of habitat projected for bull trout. This project sought to further elaborate how these climate-related threats influence bull trout across five western states (OR, WA, ID, MT, NV). These states form the southern margin of the species\u2019 range. We used predictions of temperatures in streams across approximately two-thirds of this extent to map coldwater streams or \u201cpatches\u201d suitable for spawning [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Jason Dunham", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Stephen Zylstra", "oldPartyId": 11661, "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Daniel Isaak", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "active": true, "firstName": "Daniel", "lastName": "Isaak", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Seth Wenger", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Georgia"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59609, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Process was delayed as project was waiting on the production of data from another FY11 project.

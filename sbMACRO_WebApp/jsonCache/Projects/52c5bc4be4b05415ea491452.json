These saltmarshes, mudflats, and shallow bays are not only critical for wildlife, but they also provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Today, sea-level rise, more frequent and stronger storms, saltwater intrusion, and warming water temperatures are among the threats that are altering these important habitats.   Much of the existing research on anticipating the effects of changing conditions on coastal ecosystems relies on global or regional scale data, meaning that the detailed information necessary for local-scale decision [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Glen MacDonald", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "macdonal@geog.ucla.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "UCLA"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "310-825-5008", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "UCLA 405 Hilgard Ave.", "city": "Los Angeles", "state": "CA", "zip": "90095", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Karen M Thorne", "oldPartyId": 13502, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Ecologist (Landscape)", "firstName": "Karen", "middleName": "M", "lastName": "Thorne", "organization": {"displayText": "Western Ecological Research Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Karen M Thorne/BRD/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "building": "SF BAY FLD STATION IN KIND - BLDG 505 MAIN OFC TRLR", "buildingCode": "WBW", "officePhone": "7075623003", "faxPhone": "7075622005", "streetAddress": {"line1": "505 Azuar Drive", "city": "Vallejo", "state": "CA", "zip": "94592", "country": "US"}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Modoc Hall, USGS, 3020 State University Drive East", "city": "Sacramento", "state": "CA", "zip": "95819", "country": "USA"}}}], "history": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "DMP": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Potential_Products": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Received_Products": {"Items": {"Project_Item_Count": 0, "Project_Item_List": []}, "Files": {"Project_File_Count": 0, "Project_File_List": []}}}

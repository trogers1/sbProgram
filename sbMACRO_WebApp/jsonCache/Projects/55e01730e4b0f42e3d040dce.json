The raw data is available in netCDF format, which is a standard data file format for weather forecasting/climate change/GIS applications. However, the sheer size of these datasets and the specific file format (netCDF) for data access pose significant barriers to data access for many users. This is a particular challenge for many natural/cultural resource managers and others working on conservation efforts in the Pacific Northwest. The goal of this project was to increase the accessibility of [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Katherine Hegewisch", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "John Abatzoglou", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "jabatzoglou@uidaho.edu", "active": true, "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Abatzoglou", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "DMP Complete.\n7/13 - Products discussed.

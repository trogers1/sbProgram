Such knowledge and practices can provide valuable insight as to how tribal and non-tribal resource managers, communities, and governments can best respond to the effects of a changing climate.  This project was a pilot effort to collect and translate indigenous knowledge and practices into shareable formats. Researchers developed documents, images, lesson plans, and innovative, interactive 3-D virtual reality simulations that effectively convey Schitsu\u2019umsh knowledge and practices and supply recommendations [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Rodney Frey", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "rfrey@uidaho.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Jeremy Kenyon", "oldPartyId": 61144, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "jkenyon@uidaho.edu", "active": true, "firstName": "Jeremy", "lastName": "Kenyon", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Leanne Campbell", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "lvcampbell@cdatribe-nsn.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "NCCWSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Brian Cleveley", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "email": "cbc@uidaho.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Steven Daley-Laursen", "oldPartyId": 60842, "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "email": "stevendl@uidaho.edu", "active": true, "firstName": "Steven", "lastName": "Daley-Laursen", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Marisa L Guarinello", "oldPartyId": 28114, "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "description": "Record created from FPPS data from 1992 through 2009.", "firstName": "Marisa", "middleName": "L", "lastName": "Guarinello", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Geological Survey"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Products have been uploaded to SB.

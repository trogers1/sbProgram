These species depend on food and habitats provided by estuaries (coastal tidal areas where streams and rivers flow into the ocean) for successful migration and breeding. Climate change effects such as drought, sea-level rise, and changing freshwater flow, precipitation, and temperatures will alter these important habitats.  This study examines how changing ocean and freshwater patterns and conditions will influence estuary habitats. The main goal is to provide scientific support for future planning efforts and conservation of natural resources found in coastal ecosystems.

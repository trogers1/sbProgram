Reduced precipitation can also lead to lower water levels in streams and losses in the vegetation that grows alongside riverbanks.   The goal of this project was to identify how hydrologic systems in the Southwest might respond to changes in climate and the degree to which this response is dependent on the characteristics of the hydrologic system. To do this, researchers developed a tool that simulates how quickly water moves from [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Ty Ferr\u00e9", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "tyferre@gmail.com", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona (UA), Hydrology and Water Resources"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "520-621-2952", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Jesse E Dickinson", "oldPartyId": 2531, "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Arizona Water Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Christopher L Castro", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "UA Atmospheric Sciences"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Peter A Troch", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "UA Hydrology and Water Resources"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Rafael Rosolem", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "UA Hydrology and Water Resources"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Hoshin Gupta", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "UA Hydrology and Water Resources"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Stanley A Leake", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Pamela L Nagler", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Randy Hanson", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "UA Water, Environmental and Energy Solutions", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "USGS National Institute for Water Resources", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "USGS Office of Groundwater", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59610, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "DMP": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Potential_Products": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

In the western U.S., severe drought and rising temperatures have caused increased tree mortality and complete forest diebacks. Forests are changing rapidly, and while land managers are working to develop long-term climate change adaptation plans, they require tools that can enhance forest resistance to drought now. To address this immediate need, researchers are examining whether a common forest management tool, prescribed fire, can be implemented to help forests better survive drought.   Prescribed fire is commonly used in the western U.S. to remove potential wildfire fuel, such as small trees and shrubs. It is also thought that this act of selectively removing some trees [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Phillip van Mantgem", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "pvanmantgem@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "Redwood Field Station, WERC"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "7078255189", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "1655 Heindon Road", "city": "Arcata", "state": "CA", "zip": "95521", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Donald A.

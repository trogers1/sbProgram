However, snow droughts significantly lower snow accumulations, disrupting these critical water supplies for local communities and ecosystems. Despite its large influence on land- and water-resource management, snow drought has only recently been properly defined and its historical distribution and effects on key natural resources are essentially unknown. To remedy this serious knowledge gap, project researchers are examining the causes, effects, and forecastability of snow drought to provide needed scientific information and guidance to planners and decision makers.   The central goals of this proposal are to [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Adrian Harpold", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "adrian.harpold@gmail.com", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Nevada, Reno"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "(775) 784-6759", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "1664 N.

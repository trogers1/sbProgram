The sensitivity of species and habitats to climate was cross-walked with recently developed Coast Salish community health indicators (e.g., ceremonial use, knowledge exchange, and physiological well-being) in order to demonstrate how Indigenous Knowledge can be used in conjunction with established landscape-level conservation indicators (e.g., shellfish and water-quality) and employed to identify resource management priorities. Project products include: (1) maps and models that highlight potential impacts in regard to Swinomish first foods and cultural sites; (2) an evaluation [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Jamie Donatuto", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "jdonatuto@swinomish.nsn.us", "organization": {"displayText": "Swinomish Indian Tribal Community"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Sarah Grossman", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "sgrossman@swinomish.nsn.us", "organization": {"displayText": "Swinomish Indian Tribal Community"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Eric Grossman", "oldPartyId": 3974, "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "egrossman@usgs.gov", "active": true, "firstName": "Eric", "lastName": "Grossman", "cellPhone": "8312344674", "organization": {"displayText": "Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Eric Grossman/GD/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "building": "2831 Mission St (Marine Facility) Aca07585", "buildingCode": "WAP", "officePhone": "8314607525", "faxPhone": "8314274748", "streetAddress": {"line1": "2831 Mission Street", "city": "Santa Cruz", "state": "CA", "zip": "95060"}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "400 Natural Bridges Drive", "city": "Santa Cruz", "state": "CA", "zip": "95060", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Swinomish Indian Tribal Community", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59609, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "North Pacific LCC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Tom Miewald of the NP LCC is handling this project.\n(4/1/2015)\n11/19 - Some back and forth with NW CSC/LCC staff.

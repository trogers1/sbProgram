These objectives were designed to address decision support needs for climate adaptation and resource management actions. Specifically, understanding of uncertainty in climate projections - in particular for extreme events - is currently a key scientific and management barrier to adaptation planning and vulnerability assessment. The new dataset fills in the Northwest domain to cover a key gap in the previous dataset, adds additional projections (both from other global climate models and a comparison [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Eric Salath\u00e9", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "salathe@uw.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington Bothell Science and Technology Program"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Jeremy Littell", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "jlittell@uw.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington Climate Impacts Group"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "206-221-2997", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Alan Hamlet", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "hamleaf@uw.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Nathan Mantua", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "nmantua@uw.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington, School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "oldPartyId": 59609, "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Data was prepared for delivery.

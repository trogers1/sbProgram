Aspen woodlands also provide high quality forage for livestock and draw tourists to the region to view the golden vistas that form in the fall.   However, aspen is currently declining across large portions of the West and it\u2019s estimated that approximately 40% of western aspen will be without suitable climate conditions within 50 years. In the northern and central Rocky Mountains, it\u2019s thought that reduced soil moisture [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Douglas Shinneman", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "dshinneman@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center (FRESC)"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "2084265206", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "970 Lusk Street", "city": "Boise", "state": "ID", "zip": "83706", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Timothy Link", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "tlink@uidaho.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Kathleen Kavanagh", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Eva Strand", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Susan McIlroy", "oldPartyId": 19771, "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "email": "smcilroy@usgs.gov", "active": true, "jobTitle": "Ecologist", "firstName": "Susan", "lastName": "McIlroy", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS FRESC"}, "primaryLocation": {"name": "Susan McIlroy/BRD/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "buildingCode": "WID", "streetAddress": {"line1": "970 Lusk Street", "city": "Boise", "state": "ID", "zip": "83706", "country": "US"}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "970 Lusk Street", "city": "Boise", "state": "ID", "zip": "83706", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Scott Powell", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Montana State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Robert Scheller", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Portland State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "John Campbell", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Daniel Marks", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USDA Northwest Watershed Research Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Mark Seyfried", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USDA Northwest Watershed Research Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Adam Winstral", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USDA Northwest Watershed Research Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "DMP Complete.\n1/6/17 - Talked with Link and co. about their data.

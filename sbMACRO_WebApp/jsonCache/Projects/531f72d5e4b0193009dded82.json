However, if forested landscapes can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Results from our research team demonstrate that in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), opening dense forest canopies through creating forest gaps will generally lead to more snow accumulation and later melt (i.e., up to 13 weeks later). However, under certain conditions, such as locations on ridges with high wind speeds and sunny south-facing slopes, the snow that accumulated in the forest is likely to melt more [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Jessica Lundquist", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "jdlund@u.washington.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "206-685-7594", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Civil and Environmental Engineering\r\nUniversity of Washington\r\nBox 352700", "city": "Seattle", "state": "WA", "zip": "98195-2700", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Jim Lutz", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Susan Dickerson-Lange", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Anne Nolin", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Timothy Link", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Amy Snover", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Rolf Gersonde", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Cedar River Municipal Watershed"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Steve Malloch", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "National Wildlife Federation"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "DMP Complete.\n2/9 - Was contacted by Susan Dickerson-Lange about acquiring a DOI for citation and transferring data to SB in order to do so.

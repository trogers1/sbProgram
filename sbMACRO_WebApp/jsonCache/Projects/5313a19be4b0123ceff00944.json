Wildfire activity is widely projected to increase in response to climate change in the Northwest, but we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of what this increase will look like or what its impacts will be on a variety of ecological and hydrologic systems. This project is addressing one critical part of those impacts: the islands of unburned vegetation within wildfires. Unburned islands occur naturally as wildfires burn across landscapes, and are important habitat refuges for species -- places where plants and animals survive the fire and subsequently [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Crystal Kolden", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "ckolden@uidaho.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "208-885-6018", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "875 Perimeter Dr. MS 3021", "city": "Moscow", "state": "ID", "zip": "83844-3021", "country": "United States"}}}, {"name": "John Abatzoglou", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Idaho"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "James Lutz", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Matthew Germino", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Forest and Rangeland Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Carl Key", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Northern Rockies Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Jan van Wagtendonk", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Western Ecological Research Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Nate Benson", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "NPS National Office"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Regina Rochefort", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "North Cascades National Park"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Cyndi Sidles", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "FWS Pacific Region"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Vita Wright", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Northern Rockies Fire Science Network"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "DMP Complete.\n12/10/16 - Project was given an extension until Aug 2017.\n8/3/17 - Betsy sent me the final report.  There are links to the products that go to a website that fails.\n8/4/17 - Contacted Crystal.  There are three products, two are listed in the report, one is not discussed (as far as I could tell).  Both listed products have the same weblink and that weblink only has one product the CBI geodatabase.  And it fails due to a sharepoint error of some sort.  So - there is only one dataset evidently available and it is inaccessible.  Hoping for more details.\n8/4/17 - They will assist in getting the data into SB.  Turns out one of the products was not created due to the method not panning out during research.  Waiting for post-doc to return on 8/25 to move this forward.\n8/25/17 - Spoke with Meddens.  We are meeting on 8/28 to discuss in more detail.\n8/28/17 - Met with Meddens.  Walked through the use of the Metadata Wizard to create some FGDC files.  Identified two products to be delivered.  Expects to be done this week sometime.\n8/30/17 - Received data from Meddens with xml FGDC files.  Uploading and will send link to Meddens for review.\n8/31/17 - Items posted to SB.  Meddens provided a better abstract and approved the contents in SB.  Emailed Gus, et al. on closeout.", "DMP": "Approved", "Potential_Products": "No Info Provided", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

Land and resource managers, planners, and decision-makers are looking for the best scientific information to guide their decisions about adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change now and in the future. To address this need, a primary goal of the Southwest Climate Science Center is to develop actionable science \u2013 scientific information that can be easily used to inform these decisions.   Evidence shows that more collaborative forms of knowledge development and exchange between scientists and decision makers tend to produce information that is considered more trusted and usable, and lead to higher-quality decisions about [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Alison Meadow", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "meadow@email.arizona.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "null", "city": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null", "country": "null"}}}, {"name": "Tamara Wall", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Desert Research Institute"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "null", "city": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null", "country": "null"}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "DMP": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Potential_Products": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

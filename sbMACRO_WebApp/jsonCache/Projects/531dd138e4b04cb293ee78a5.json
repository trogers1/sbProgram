Resource managers in the Great Basin are dealing with significant questions regarding how best to make decisions in the natural and human systems in response to climate change. Vulnerability assessments and other tools are used for climate change adaptation, but their effectiveness is not widely understood or examined. Assessing these tools for their utility and for their ability to translate science into accessible and available information for users, including the general public, is critical for the future viability and sustainability of the Great Basin. This project applies social and policy methods to these important [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Eric Lindquist", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "ericlindquist@boisestate.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "Boise State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "208-426-3770", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Boise State University\r\n1910 University Dr", "city": "Boise", "state": "ID", "zip": "83725-1936", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Shawn Benner", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Boise State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Mark Brunson", "oldPartyId": 56050, "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "description": "Record created from UCRB Mendeley data.", "firstName": "Mark", "lastName": "Brunson", "organization": {"displayText": "Utah State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Matt Germino", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS, Great Basin LCC"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Todd Hopkins", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Great Basin LCC"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Richard Klein", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Stockholm Environment Institute"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Denise Lach", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Stephanie Witt", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Boise State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Tamara Wall", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "Desert Research Institute and California Nevada Applications Program"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "DMP Complete.\n6/28 - Contacted Lindquist about the status of the data products.

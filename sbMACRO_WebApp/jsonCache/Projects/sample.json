    "summary": "In the Northwest U.S., warming temperatures and changing precipitation patterns will likely result in significantly altered snowpack, stream flows, and water availability. Along with these changes comes an increased risk of “ecological drought”, or periods of water stress that impact ecosystems and the services they provide –which can ultimately impact human communities.   More frequent and severe ecological droughts have the potential to push ecosystems beyond their ability to recover, resulting in complete changes in ecosystem composition and function.  Ecological drought will only worsen existing management challenges, such as competition for water resources, habitat degradation, invasive species, and more frequent and severe wildfires. [...]",

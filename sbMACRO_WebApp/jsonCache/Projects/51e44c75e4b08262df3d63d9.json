In recent years, climate variability on annual and decadal time scales has been recognized as greater than commonly perceived with increasing impacts on ecosystems and available water resources. Changes in vegetation distribution, composition and productivity resulting from climate change affect plant water use, which in turn can alter stream flow, groundwater and eventually available water resources. To better understand these links, project researchers implemented two computer-based numeric models in the Cleve Creek watershed in the Schell Creek Range, east of Ely, Nevada. The application of the two models to study [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Alexandra Lutz", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "Alexandra.Lutz@dri.edu", "cellPhone": "775-673-7418", "company": "DRI", "organization": {"displayText": "Desert Research Institute (DRI)"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "775-673-7418", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Rosemary Carroll", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "DRI"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Guoping Tang", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "DRI"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "James Thomas", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "contactType": "person", "description": "Record created from FPPS data from 1992 through 2009.", "firstName": "James", "middleName": "R", "lastName": "Thomas", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Geological Survey"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Joseph F.

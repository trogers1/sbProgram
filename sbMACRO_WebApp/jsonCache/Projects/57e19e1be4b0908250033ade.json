Recognizing this, efforts across the country are underway to support and enhance the capacity of tribes to prepare for climate change risks. However, due to staffing, technical, and financial limitations, many tribes continue to experience difficulty initiating and completing the critical first step of the climate adaptation planning process: a \u201cclimate change vulnerability assessment\u201d, i.e., a structured assessment of the specific potential impacts of climate change that the tribe may be exposed to, [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Meade Krosby", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "mkrosby@uw.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "206-579-8023", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "null", "city": "Seattle", "state": "WA", "zip": "null", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Lara Whitely-Binder", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington Climate Impacts Group"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "11/1/16 - Contacted regarding DMP.\n11/7/16 - Krosby replied with some folks to add.

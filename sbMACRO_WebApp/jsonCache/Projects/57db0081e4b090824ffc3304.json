Land and resource managers, planners, and decision-makers are looking for the best scientific information to guide their decisions about adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change now and in the future. A major goal of the Northwest Climate Science Center (CSC) and the CSC network as a whole is the development of \u201cactionable science\u201d, or scientific information that can be easily used by managers and planners to inform these important decisions. However, the current community of researchers and decision-makers are in need of guidance about the best ways to work together and the activities or strategies that are most effective [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Alison Meadow", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "meadow@email.arizona.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Arizona"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "520-626-0652", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "1064 E Lowell St.", "city": "Tucson", "state": "Arizona", "zip": "85721", "country": "USA"}}}, {"name": "Tamara Wall", "type": "Co-Investigator", "contactType": "person", "email": "tamara.wall@dri.edu", "organization": {"displayText": "Desert Research Institute"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "null", "city": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null", "country": "null"}}}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "11/1/16 - Contacted regarding DMP.\n12/2/16 - Approved DMP after PIs filled out further.", "DMP": "Approved", "Potential_Products": "Data Input New Collection: Developmental Evaluation of the NW CSC\n\nData Products: Evaluative data on process, outcomes, and impacts of climate research funded by the NW CSC", "Received_Products": "Not yet implemented"}

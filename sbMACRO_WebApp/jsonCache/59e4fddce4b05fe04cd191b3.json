These include: quantifying the rates of land use change in and around the protected area systems, determining the extent of fragmentation in major ecosystems, assessing evaporative demands, and predicting forest ecosystem responses to climate change. We found that rates of climate and land use change varied across the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, as did the responses of ecosystems to these changes. We also identified the major locations highly impacted by these changes that call for crafting locally relevant adaptation strategies to cope with these changes. Now, the second phase of the project (FY\u201917) aims at generating coproduction of knowledge targeting a wide range of stakeholders to support decision makers for the management and conservation of affected areas. During the FY\u201917 phase of the project, we will focus on working with various user groups to evaluate potential land use and climate impacts and adaptation strategies for the most affected areas and ecosystem types identified by our previous work. Specifically, we will focus on forest and shrubland vegetation and habitat of a selected wildlife species (wolverine) in the Rocky Mountains and Washington Cascade regions. We will design resource briefs on land use and climate change assessments of selected areas and ecosystem types to provide information to coordinated management. In addition to resource briefs, our approach will be to convene a series of webinars and workshops with federal, private, and NGO stakeholders (including the whitebark pine team) to draw on all of the science results (e.g., from species distribution models, state and transition models, and mechanistic models) to identify and evaluate vegetation climate adaptation strategies that are robust under climate uncertainty.\n\nThis project team is part of the North Central Climate Science Center\u2019s Foundational Science Area Team, which supports foundational research and advice, guidance, and technical assistance to other NC CSC projects as they address climate science challenges that are important for land managers and ecologists in the region.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=596f5c55e4b0d1f9f0645ea2"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -94.6012, "maxY": 49.0, "minX": -116.0635, "minY": 36.9889}, "representationalPoint": [-105.33235, 42.99445], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "NC CSC Foundational Science: Impacts and Vulnerability FY17", "summary": "Researchers with the North Central Climate Science Center have made substantial progress in assessing the impacts of climate and land use change on wildlife and ecosystems across the region.

Simultaneously, the National Park Service (NPS) has developed a new streamlined approach to guiding prioritization of a park\u2019s long-term investments in resource stewardship, known as a Resource Stewardship Strategy (RSS). Development of an RSS occurs during one or two workshops, during which staff must assess all available information about the condition of, and threats to, park resources and determine priority management strategies and actions. Observed trends, projections, and projected effects of climate change are assessed as part of this work and must be considered as one of the many influences evaluated. Consequently, NPS is developing a structured, repeatable approach for providing climate projections and scenarios to inform RSS development. This servicewide planning initiative presents a valuable opportunity for the NPS to collaborate with staff of the North Central Climate Science Center (NC CSC) and build on work recently completed in the northern Great Plains. Our team has identified two opportunities to facilitate management application of, and to extend knowledge gained from, our previous NC CSC work: 1) Develop a management-relevant and manager-accessible publication and resource brief to support short-term planning at Badlands NP and in surrounding federal and tribal lands and lay the groundwork for future RSS development at the park; and 2) Pilot a process for integrating more robust scenario planning and climate science into NPS RSSs by collaborating on the upcoming RSS development for nearby Devils Tower NM. 1) In our earlier work, we made substantial strides in combining qualitative and quantitative scenarios, which stretched manager thinking about the range of possible future conditions, highlighted important management tradeoffs, and identified remaining information needs. Because the team\u2019s scientists and adaptation specialists collaborated closely with resource managers in the development of a simulation model specific to the region and its key resource questions, as well as in interpreting its output, the managers understand and appreciate the model\u2019s implications. However, documenting the voluminous and multifaceted results of the modeling is necessary for their longevity and translation into future planning efforts. Therefore, we will publish the modeling results in a comprehensive, peer-reviewed article and distill them into a management-relevant resource brief. 2) The NPS RSS program will develop RSSs for all NPS units in coming years. The RSS effort thus represents a critical opportunity to \u2018mainstream\u2019 climate considerations into park planning servicewide. The NPS Climate Change Response Program (CCRP) typically provides guidance on climate change considerations, including park-specific climate projections and potential resource impacts, as well as methods for planning under uncertainty using principles of scenario planning. For most parks, this is a first and necessarily brief experience with scenarios and scenario planning, and therefore CCRP typically shares just two climate scenarios that bound a range of possible climate changes and resource impacts. Participants are encouraged to develop long- and short-term resource goals and management activities that explicitly consider this range of possible future conditions, in what is effectively a \u201clite\u201d form of scenario planning. The opportunity to explore the integration of more robust climate-change scenario planning into the RSS process for Devils Tower NM has the potential to benefit many other national park units interested in planning to address future impacts of climate change. We will intensively weave scenario thinking and climate science into the RSS of Devils Tower NM, an NPS unit with a strong interest in climate change assessment and adaptation, and fully document the process and lessons learned as a model for other NPS units to refine and replicate. Our work, which focuses on translating existing climate science and incorporating it into an established planning process for two parks, seeks to accomplish two larger capacity-building goals: 1) continue developing the NC CSC-NPS science-manager partnership to foster understanding of \u201cclient\u201d needs so that the CSC can continue to provide management-relevant science, and 2) develop a repeatable methodology that the NPS can use to better incorporate scenarios and climate science into RSSs."}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}, {"annualBudgets":

In this one year proposal, we specifically aim to build on our ongoing research and tools development effort to produce synthesis materials in form of data and research briefs to promote advancement of user engagement with the most informed scientific understanding, and emerging tools and applications. We propose engagements on four specific topical areas in addition to the general outreach with stakeholders that we will continue to deliver. The first topic includes synthesis of our work on evaporative demand (aka potential evapotranspiration) and its projections in the 21st century in the NCCSC region. We will develop high-resolution datasets, maps and 2-pager type synthesis materials to bring our best understanding currently into the nature of change of the evaporative demand term in the NCCSC region during the 21st century. The second topic includes our continuing engagement with and development of the climate scenarios tool, which will include putting together a web-based platform to generate and disseminate this information.

In this one year proposal, we will build on our existing research and outreach engagements with stakeholders in the NC CSC region. We specifically propose to work on four specific tasks which will enhance a broader-understanding and usability of research, datasets, and tools that we have developed in our ongoing engagement with the NC CSC. These include our foundational research into drought processes in the NC CSC region and how the evaporative stress on the ecosystems will change during the 21st century. Related to that, we will continue to work with the stakeholder community in providing climate data for impacts assessment as well as in the use and applicability of a drought monitoring tool, called EDDI, which assesses evaporative stress on land at very high resolution. We also propose to develop another drought indicator tool that uses high resolution satellite based observations to inform us about moisture availability in the soils. Lastly, we will continue to develop and provide information related to future climate scenarios to different stakeholder for their target region and sector in order to understand impacts and develop adaptation strategies.\n\nThis project team is part of the North Central Climate Science Center\u2019s Foundational Science Area Team, which supports foundational research and advice, guidance, and technical assistance to other NC CSC projects as they address climate science challenges that are important for land managers and ecologists in the region.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5970a995e4b0d1f9f065c29f"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -94.6012, "maxY": 49.0, "minX": -116.0635, "minY": 36.9889}, "representationalPoint": [-105.33235, 42.99445], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Foundational Science Area: Evaporative Demand, Drought Monitoring and Assessment across Timescales", "summary": "In the North Central U.S., drought is a dominant driver of ecological, economic, and social stress.

These changes include shifting precipitation patterns, warming temperatures, and more frequent extreme events, such as droughts and floods. As these changes occur, managers face different challenges and have different needs, depending on the resources they manage. For example, water managers are focused on responding to changes in water availability, while wildlife managers may be more concerned with changing habitat conditions \u2013 whether it be for migratory waterfowl, coldwater fish, or large mammals.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nIn the face of these changes, managers are seeking effective strategies for managing resources.

These changes are being experienced in different ways across different management sectors. For instance; water managers need to respond to changing hydrological flows, early snowmelt, rain on snow events, more intensive rainfall events, as well as droughts. Whereas, wildlife managers will need different strategies depending on the nature of the species of concern which may vary from migratory water fowl, alpine amphibians, cold water fish, insects, or large mammals. These managers need to deal with direct climate effects on the specific target species, as well as important indirect effects associated with disturbance events, impacts on natural resource assets (e.g., forage availability, pest or disease exposures, habitat quality at the right season, or water availability), and species interactions. The scientific community alone cannot develop actionable science results for these management entities. The process of generating usable research findings for adaptation efforts to climate change is an emerging need so that appropriate management strategies can be implemented to deal with climate changes. The process of generating research efforts which can be used by resource managers occur through various processes of interactions between the research and the management communities. The process ranges from one where a researcher or a manager independently generates a solution, to where co-development of a research to action is co-designed in partnership with managers and researchers. Our research effort under FY17 funding will attempt to assess and evaluate the various process employed by the NCCSC over the past 6 years and to assess these efforts relative the delivery of usable research to the management communities we have worked with. The goal of the effort is to identify the set of processes best suited to develop actionable research findings that are useful to the management community.\n\nThis project team is part of the North Central Climate Science Center\u2019s Foundational Science Area Team, which supports foundational research and advice, guidance, and technical assistance to other NC CSC projects as they address climate science challenges that are important for land managers and ecologists in the region.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=596f6226e4b0d1f9f0645ec8"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -94.6012, "maxY": 49.0, "minX": -116.0635, "minY": 36.9889}, "representationalPoint": [-105.33235, 42.99445], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "NC CSC FY 2017 FSA3-Adaptation: Sustaining Stakeholder Engagement and Evaluation", "summary": "In the North Central U.S., the rate and extent of changing climate conditions has been increasing in recent decades.

This project will help provide that broad perspective by examining previous research and management practices related to PJ ecosystems to identify what is known, and what remains to be studied.", "systemTypes": ["Folder"], "tags": [{"name": "CSC", "scheme": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/vocab/category/NCCWSC/Project/OrganizationType", "type": "Community"}, {"name": "North Central CSC", "scheme": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/vocab/category/NCCWSC/Project/OrganizationName", "type": "Organization"}, {"name": "Landscapes", "scheme": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/vocab/category/NCCWSC/ScienceThemes", "type": "Science Themes"}, {"name": "2017", "scheme": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/vocab/category/NCCWSC/Project/FiscalYear", "type": "Fiscal Year"}, {"name": "Forests", "scheme": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/vocab/category/NCCWSC/Landscapes", "type": "Landscapes"}], "title": "Ecology and Management of Pinyon-Juniper Woodlands: State of the Science"}, "total_fy_data": null}], "sb_json": {"distributionLinks": [{"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "KML Service", "type": "kml", "typeLabel": "KML Download", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/59e4fddce4b05fe04cd191b3?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=childrenBoundingBox,children"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase WMS Service", "type": "serviceCapabilitiesUrl", "typeLabel": "OGC Service Capabilities URL", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/59e4fddce4b05fe04cd191b3?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection JSON", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=59e4fddce4b05fe04cd191b3&format=json"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection ATOM", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=59e4fddce4b05fe04cd191b3&format=atom"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection CSV", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=59e4fddce4b05fe04cd191b3&format=csv"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase OAI PMH Service", "type": "oai-pmh", "typeLabel": "OAI-PMH", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=59e4fddce4b05fe04cd191b3"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase CSW Service", "type": "csw", "typeLabel": "", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59e4fddce4b05fe04cd191b3/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords"}], "hasChildren": true, "id": "59e4fddce4b05fe04cd191b3", "link": {"rel": "self", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59e4fddce4b05fe04cd191b3"}, "parentId": "4f83509de4b0e84f60868124", "provenance": {"dataSource": "Input directly", "dateCreated": "2017-10-16T18:43:40Z", "lastUpdated": "2017-10-16T18:46:13Z"}, "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=59e4fddce4b05fe04cd191b3"}}, "systemTypes": ["Folder"], "title": "FY 2017 Projects"}, "total_fy_data": 0}

These impacts will exacerbate current resource management challenges such as conflicts over water resources, land use and degradation, invasive species, maintaining agricultural yields, and managing wildfires. We propose to evaluate and synthesize the scientific body of research on ecological drought adaptation actions available to and in use by resource managers in the Northwest (i.e. Washington, Oregon, Idaho, western Montana). Products will include a state-of-the-science synthesis report on ecological drought climate adaptation actions and a management-focused fact sheet on effective ecological drought adaptation actions for the Northwest region. Knowing which adaptation actions can be best implemented at different scales and in various ecosystems will help resource managers to identify and leverage funding opportunities, create new or enhance existing partnerships, and communicate and coordinate with other agencies and organizations to prioritize on-the-ground ecological drought responses. Primary users of the results and products include scientists, resource managers, and policy makers responsible for responding to the challenges presented by ecological drought.

Current information sources such as general ecological summaries or county-level range maps are not sufficient to assess the current and projected future impact that climate change will have on traditional foods, nor provide the specificity to develop tools to pinpoint or reduce vulnerability to potential changes. Traditional foods are key to the sense of place in Native American culture and strong traditions exist for the collection, storage, and consumption of these foods as well as, in some cases, plant culture. Shrubs such as native huckleberries, salal, and hazelnut are also important for wildlife and non-tribal food gathering. This project will synthesize location and life history data from multiple inventory and scientific data sources to develop range maps, climate-envelope models, and phenological models for focal shrub species of the Northwest. We will provide a web-platform for users to explore information on the life history and traditional uses of native shrub foods, and observe how possible climate change scenarios may alter shrub species ranges and the timing of their flowering and fruiting in the future. We will work with Northwestern tribes to identify shrubs of significant cultural interest to focus on and interact with them frequently to ensure the products we are producing are relevant to them. We will create the project products in collaboration with personnel from a minimum of 4 tribes, two National Forests, the Cedar River Watershed, the Conservation Biology Institute, and the University of Idaho.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=595677bee4b0d1f9f050d84e"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -110.853424072266, "maxY": 48.980216985375, "minX": -124.740142822266, "minY": 42.0982224111897}, "representationalPoint": [-117.796783447266, 45.53921969828235], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Will Climate Warming Affect Locations or Timing of Availability of Food Sources from Native Northwestern Shrubs?", "summary": "Fruit-producing shrubs such as huckleberries, salal, and hazelnut are an important component of social history and traditional tribal diets in the Pacific Northwest.

The resulting synthesis will provide managers with decision-support tools to help evaluate emerging risks of invasive species and identify information gaps that should be addressed with future research and monitoring."}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}, {"annualBudgets": [{"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds": 114999.0, "year": "2017"}], "className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet", "facetName": "Budget", "parts": [{"type": "Award Type", "value": "COA"}, {"type": "Award Number", "value": "RR00"}], "totalFunds": 114999.0}], "files": [{"checksum": {"type": "MD5", "value": "4cadd7de13416c74ae80f8ba806e92e7"}, "contentEncoding": null, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "dateUploaded": "2017-11-29T21:30:07Z", "downloadUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__2f%2Ffb%2Fcb%2F2ffbcb76defa7815cc005182e862d194b57c53d0", "imageHeight": 427, "imageWidth": 640, "name": "Castle_rock_wildfire_Kari_Greer_FWS.jpg", "originalMetadata": false, "pathOnDisk": "__disk__2f/fb/cb/2ffbcb76defa7815cc005182e862d194b57c53d0", "previewImage": {"small": {"height": 234, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__2f%2Ffb%2Fcb%2F2ffbcb76defa7815cc005182e862d194b57c53d0&width=350&height=234", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 100, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__2f%2Ffb%2Fcb%2F2ffbcb76defa7815cc005182e862d194b57c53d0&width=150&height=100", "width": 150}}, "processToken": null, "processed": false, "s3Object": null, "size": 231504, "title": "Cheatgrass Fire Credit: Keri Greer, USFWS", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__2f%2Ffb%2Fcb%2F2ffbcb76defa7815cc005182e862d194b57c53d0", "useForPreview": true, "viewUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__2f%2Ffb%2Fcb%2F2ffbcb76defa7815cc005182e862d194b57c53d0&width=640&height=427"}], "hasChildren": true, "id": "5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961", "identifiers": [{"key": "5987f2d0-3e93-429e-8104-98d40fe2a9af", "scheme": "NCCWSC", "type": "RegistrationUUID"}, {"key": "NW17-MC1265", "scheme": "NCCWSC", "type": "StampID"}], "link": {"rel": "self", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961"}, "parentId": "59c92c5ae4b017cf313f0e64", "previewImage": {"alternateImages": [{"from": "mapPreview", "original": {"height": 240, "size": 168638, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__a1%2F49%2Fce%2Fa149cec6c56fc001a46b6bd961b9da718072ba0d", "viewUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__a1%2F49%2Fce%2Fa149cec6c56fc001a46b6bd961b9da718072ba0d&width=360&height=240", "viewUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?deprecated=__use__viewUri__instead__&f=__disk__a1%2F49%2Fce%2Fa149cec6c56fc001a46b6bd961b9da718072ba0d&width=360&height=240", "width": 360}, "thumbnail": {"height": 100, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__a1%2F49%2Fce%2Fa149cec6c56fc001a46b6bd961b9da718072ba0d&width=150&height=100", "width": 150}}], "from": "attachedFile", "original": {"height": 427, "size": 231504, "title": "Cheatgrass Fire Credit: Keri Greer, USFWS", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__2f%2Ffb%2Fcb%2F2ffbcb76defa7815cc005182e862d194b57c53d0", "viewUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__2f%2Ffb%2Fcb%2F2ffbcb76defa7815cc005182e862d194b57c53d0&width=640&height=427", "viewUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?deprecated=__use__viewUri__instead__&f=__disk__2f%2Ffb%2Fcb%2F2ffbcb76defa7815cc005182e862d194b57c53d0&width=640&height=427", "width": 640}, "small": {"height": 234, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__2f%2Ffb%2Fcb%2F2ffbcb76defa7815cc005182e862d194b57c53d0&width=350&height=234", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 100, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961?f=__disk__2f%2Ffb%2Fcb%2F2ffbcb76defa7815cc005182e862d194b57c53d0&width=150&height=100", "width": 150}}, "provenance": {"dateCreated": "2017-06-30T19:45:19Z", "harvesterCode": "rfpManager-2.4.1 gov.usgs.eventManager.ScienceBaseService.store()", "lastUpdated": "2018-01-29T19:24:49Z"}, "purpose": "Invasive species pose significant threats to both aquatic and terrestrial systems, as well as managed and natural ecosystems. The ecological impacts of invasive species are often irreversible and far-reaching, including reductions in the distribution, abundance, and diversity of native species and increases in the prevalence of disease outbreaks. Invasive species also have significant impacts on local and regional economies. For example, invasive species incur dramatic economic costs through damaged water transportation systems, reduced crop yields, reduced forage quality for livestock, widespread tree mortality and associated increases in wildfire, and loss of biodiversity including endangered species. Thus, it is extremely concerning that climate change may further facilitate expansion of invasive species. This project will synthesize our existing understanding of how climate change influences the spread and impact of invasive species in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems across the northwestern United States. We will use this information to identify what environmental conditions facilitate the spread of invasive species and what habitats and species may be vulnerable to future spread. Identifying common traits in these species across ecological boundaries will help managers develop a predictive framework for recognize new potential invasive species and take steps to stop them before they become established. This will provide a powerful framework allowing managers to better evaluate the risk of invasive species and develop pro-active management strategies for future invasive species expansions throughout the Northwest.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5956aa4fe4b0d1f9f050d961"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -110.668029785156, "maxY": 49.0378679453264, "minX": -124.642639160156, "minY": 42.163403424224}, "representationalPoint": [-117.655334472656, 45.6006356847752], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "A Northwest CSC Directed Funding FY2017 Project", "summary": "Invasive species have increasingly severe consequences for ecosystems and human communities alike.

This is creating significant demand for information on the current state of knowledge to make science-based decisions. However, resource managers often find the complexity, magnitude, breadth and uncertainty of information on climate change and phenology challenging to surmise and integrate into readily apparent ways to respond. The science related to climate impacts on phenology is broad and diverse with only limited and out of date syntheses available. These challenges create the need for synthesis documents at regional levels that succinctly and conveniently communicate the current state of knowledge in the scientific literature and availability of resources such as open access data sources and monitoring protocols for managers. I will conduct this State of the Science synthesis in three parts: 1) a scientific literature review and synthesis, 2) a review and synthesis of open access data sources and monitoring protocols, and 3) a suite of analyses and interpretation of data and trends in the PNW using the USA-NPN Nature\u2019s Notebook database. The synthesis will have three primary components, a succinct summary of the current state of knowledge of primary research from the scientific literature including information gaps and adaptation options, a clear overview of the availability, content, and access of relevant open data resources and monitoring protocols, and a case study comprising analyses and interpretation of trends in phenological metrics in responses to climate change in the PNW utilizing data from the USA National Phenology Network, currently the most extensive ground-based phenology monitoring program in North America. Each of these components will be organized at three levels \u2013 ecosystem/biogeographic, taxonomic, and resource type. Additionally, there is need for a synthesis of the location, availability, scope, and application of open data sources and monitoring protocols for phenology. The broadest open-access database and off-the-shelf monitoring program is the USA-NPN. Therefor a summary of this database for the PNW and some exploratory analyses of phenological trends in the region will provide useful examples of its scope and application. The products I will provide include a State of the Science synthesis report with a primary audience of natural resource managers, professionals, scientists, and advanced students. Additionally, I will produce three fact sheets, one for each for each of the three main components of the synthesis report listed above.

While some species appear to be adjusting to the increase in unseasonal temperatures, drought, and extreme storms that have come with climate change, not all species are responding at the same speed or in the same ways.

To inform their actions, resource managers need information about how climate change will affect fire regimes, and vegetation composition, structure, and function. To address this need, we will develop a state-of-the-science synthesis on potential effects of changing climate and fire regimes on forest vegetation in the Pacific Northwest. We will compile all relevant information on potential changes in forest vegetation patterns and fire regimes with changing climate in the region, including long-term paleoecological studies of climate and species distribution, fire history studies, empirical (and field-based) studies on trends in vegetation and fire associated with recent climatic variability and change, impact model projections, and recent syntheses focused on potential climate change effects. All information will be evaluated for scientific integrity and applicability and summarized for six major forest types in the region. The final report will include a synthesis of the highest quality, relevant scientific literature, interpretation of scientific information and projections of near-term and long-term effects of changing fire regimes on forests in the region, demonstration of key trends through illustrative case studies, and recommendations for future research to inform forest management.

Climate also affects fuel moisture and the length of the season when fires are likely. In the Pacific Northwest, increased temperatures, decreased snowpack, and earlier snowmelt as the climate warms will likely lead to a longer fire season, lower fuel moisture, higher likelihood of large fires, and greater area burned by wildfire. Changes in wildfire will likely be major drivers of ecosystem change in a warming climate. Facing such changes, forest managers need information on likely changes in wildfire and forests with warming climate to help guide management and sustain ecosystem services, including timber production, carbon storage, recreation, and water quality. To address this information need, we will develop a state-of-science report on potential effects of changing climate and fire regimes on forests in the Pacific Northwest. The report will include a synthesis of the highest quality, relevant scientific literature, and interpretation of scientific information. We will provide projections of near-term and long-term effects of changing fire regimes on forests in the region, case studies illustrating recent trends, and recommendations for future research to inform forest management. The report will be written to inform forest managers in their decisions about fire management, post-fire restoration projects, climate adaptation planning, and identification of future risks. To communicate important findings of the report to a broader audience, we will develop a 4-page fact sheet with infographics and highlights from the report and a Story Map with summaries of the report and interactive maps.

I will use the results from the hydrological model VIC and the results of the vegetation model MC2 used with different climate drivers to discuss the downscaling method influence on vegetation shifts, disturbance frequency and streamflow. I will illustrate their uncertainty distribution across the Northwest landscape (e.g. coastal areas, complex topography areas) and explore their usability, suitability and utility for a range of potential users.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=595691cfe4b0d1f9f050d8b1"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -111.0468, "maxY": 48.9999, "minX": -124.7328, "minY": 41.9877}, "representationalPoint": [-117.88980000000001, 45.49379999999999], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Spoilt for Choice: A Review of Downscaled Climate Datasets for the PNW", "summary": "In order to assess and understand the potential impacts of climate change on important natural resources, managers, planners, and decision-makers need climate information at a local or regional scale.

They provide natural places for recreation, clean drinking water, and important habitats for fish and wildlife. However, the warmer temperatures and harsher droughts in the west that are related to climate change are causing die-offs of many trees. Outbreaks of insects, like the mountain pine beetle, that kill trees are also more likely in warmer, drier conditions.<br>\n<br>\nTo maintain healthy and functioning forest ecosystems, one action forest managers can take is to make management decisions that will help forests adapt to future climate change. However, adaptation is a process based on genetic change and few tools are currently available for managers to use to incorporate genetic information into management decision-making. Information is needed that links the responses of trees to environmental change and to develop genetic profiles of resistant trees. This information could then be used in screening for adaptive genetic traits and to assess genetic diversity.<br>\n<br>\nThis project will help gather that information through a pilot study focusing on mountain pine beetles and whitebark pine trees in western Montana. Researchers are investigating whether the current mountain pine beetle outbreak has resulted in the selection (survival and reproduction) of drought tolerant, and consequently, beetle resistant whitebark pines.&nbsp;They will examine tree core samples, tree resin, and pine needles to understand characteristics of the remaining forests and to collect DNA. From this work, the team expects to develop an easy and economical approach for screening whitebark pine trees for drought tolerance, beetle resistance, and genetic diversity that can be used in the conservation and restoration of this threatened, ecologically important high elevation tree, and other conifers experiencing climate-driven bark beetle outbreaks.&nbsp;</p>\n", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"contactType": "person", "email": "diana.six@cfc.umt.edu", "highlighted": true, "name": "Diana Six", "organization": {"displayText": "The University of Montana"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "Missoula", "country": "USA", "line1": "32 Campus Drive, Dept.

Recent research has demonstrated that biochar produced from low-oxygen gasification of organic residues increases soil moisture, ameliorates pH and physical properties of agricultural soils, and may be a potential tool for mitigating drought. Our objective is to evaluate the potential for biochar soil amendments to mitigate drought impacts on agriculture at a regional level by answering two key questions: 1) What are the current agronomic benefits of biochar soil amendments? and 2) What are the potential future agronomic benefits of improved drought tolerance from biochar? This study will focus on winter wheat, a crop that is grown across a large range of climate and soil conditions, and is the PNW\u2019s largest agricultural commodity. The first component of this regional assessment will be coordinated field trials at 4 locations that span a precipitation gradient from 7.5 to 41 inches yr-1, from Shedd, OR in the west to Kimberly, ID in the east. These trials will be managed in cooperation with OSU\u2019s Central Oregon Agricultural Research Station and three ARS units, and will determine the performance of two regionally sourced biochars, across different climates, soils, and irrigation practices. The field trials will be complemented by a laboratory study that measures the impact of biochar on soil moisture retention in a larger number of PNW agricultural soils. A synthesis component will compare observations of biochar benefits to regional climate predictions, and will assess the geographical regions in the PNW that are most likely to benefit from biochar amendment for drought amelioration.

This, in combination with increased temperatures and irrigation demands all threaten to create severe drought for growers in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Recent research has demonstrated that biochar based soil amendments increase soil moisture and therefore may be a potential tool for mitigating drought. Our objective is to evaluate the potential for biochar soil amendments to mitigate drought impacts on agriculture at a regional level by answering two key questions: 1) What are the current agronomic benefits of biochar soil amendments? and 2) What are the potential future agronomic benefits of improved drought tolerance from biochar? This study will focus on winter wheat, a crop that is grown across a large range of climate and soil conditions, and is the PNW\u2019s largest agricultural commodity. The first component of this regional assessment will be coordinated field trials at 4 locations that span a precipitation gradient from 7.5 to 41 inches yr-1, from Shedd, OR in the west to Kimberly, ID in the east. These trials will be managed in cooperation with OSU\u2019s Central Oregon Agricultural Research Station and three ARS units, and will determine the performance of two regionally sourced biochars, across different climates, soils, and irrigation practices. The field trials will be complemented by a laboratory study that measures the impact of biochar on ability of soils to retain water in a large number of PNW agricultural soils. A synthesis component will compare observations of biochar benefits to regional climate predictions, and will assess the geographical regions in the PNW that are most likely to benefit from biochar amendment for drought amelioration. Results of these studies will be used to develop a an interactive Biochar Atlas, that provides interactive maps that show potential biochar feedstocks, biochar producers, results of biochar studies, and calculators that can be used to estimate biochar impacts on moisture retention, as well as maps of projected changes in precipitation and temperature.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57f28ed1e4b0bc0bebfffb2e"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -111.0437, "maxY": 49.0024, "minX": -124.7564, "minY": 41.9919}, "representationalPoint": [-117.90005, 45.497150000000005], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Regional assessment of biochar soil amendments on crop productivity, drought resilience, and carbon sequestration", "summary": "Climate change impacts on water resources in the Pacific Northwest are predicted to have transformational effects on agriculture.

For ESA-listed fish populations there is a strong need for adaptation strategies that reduce the risks of drought-induced fragmentation. While a loud and high profile debate has ensued over the permanent translocation of species (i.e. assisted migration), a unique effort to seasonally translocate fish, termed \u201cfish rescue\u201d, has quietly emerged in the Pacific Northwest. Fish rescue seeks to reduce drought related mortality in wild fish by manually moving individuals from fragmented areas to either free-flowing habitat or artificial rearing facilities, providing refuge during periods of low flow. We propose to empirically and analytically evaluate fish rescue so that managers can make informed decisions about whether to apply this climate change adaptation tool more broadly throughout the region. \t\r\n\r\nWorking with managers, we will develop a coho salmon life-cycle model that quantifies how survival across serial life-stages feeds back into population dynamics. User-parameterized equations will describe the effects of drought-induced fragmentation on juvenile survival and we will provide published parameter estimates for users lacking system-specific data. We will evaluate fish rescue through terms in the model that adjust juvenile and adult survival for the rescued segment of the population. Preliminary data suggest fish rescue increases juvenile survival to >90%, but captive rearing has also been shown to reduce subsequent adult survival; users can simulate across ranges of parameter values to evaluate the risks and benefits of applying fish rescue to their specific system. To narrow the parameter estimates for rescue effects and to directly evaluate an existing fish rescue program, we will empirically measure the survival of rescued and non-rescued coho salmon using mark-recapture techniques. Our modeling framework will help managers assess the biological trade-offs and economic feasibility of fish rescue under varying contexts of drought. We will disseminate our research through a webinar, workshop, and web-based user-parameterized model. This project will be implemented by Oregon State University in collaboration with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, NOAA Fisheries, and Northwest Wild Fish Rescue.

As water levels drop, some small streams become fragmented, transforming from a ribbon of continuous habitat into a series of isolated pools. Fragmented streams pose a serious threat to salmon; juveniles that become stranded in small pools are at increased risk to overheat, starve, or be consumed by predators. Healthy salmon populations can cope with fragmentation and recover from a bad drought-year. However, many of the salmon populations are endangered and face perennial drought. Managers are increasingly finding endangered salmon stranded in fragmented habitats, facing what is presumed to be certain death. Desperate to help, a small group of managers and conservation stewards are experimenting with fish rescue, capturing juvenile salmon from fragmented habitats and moving them to hatchery-like facilities until they grow large enough to go to sea. Fish rescue programs exist as small startups handling a tiny fraction of a population. However, there are growing demands to scale-up fish rescue by applying the technique to more fish and across more watersheds. Though fish rescue is poised for rapid expansion, no one has actually evaluated whether it is safe, effective, or feasible at scales that would have meaningful impact. Holding juveniles in captivity increases their immediate survival, but it has also been shown to reduce subsequent survival, for example by decreasing the ability of fish to feed effectively in the wild after being fed in captivity. We will measure the effects of fish rescue at multiple life-stages and analyze the costs and benefits of applying this technique across the Northwest. The final product will be a tool that allows natural resource managers to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of fish rescue in the context of their specific watershed and salmon population.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57daeeace4b090824ffc3212"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -116.915582333, "maxY": 49.002491333, "minX": -124.733173333, "minY": 45.543544667}, "representationalPoint": [-120.824377833, 47.273018], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Evaluating seasonally assisted migration: are fish rescue programs an effective tool for mitigating the effects of drought on coldwater fishes?", "summary": "Climate change, drought, habitat alterations, and increasing water demands are leaving less water available for streams of the Pacific Northwest and for fish like salmon.

Understanding and predicting stream flow permanence in response to increasing aridity (Jaeger et al., 2014) is the essential first step to mitigating ecological drought and subsequent management of systems that will be resilient in the face of climate change. Yet, our understanding and available measurements of water availability in the headwaters at a landscape extent in the Northwest is surprisingly incomplete. Analysis of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), a primary source for mapping and classifying streams and water availability, revealed that classifications were correct only about 50% of the time (Fritz et al., 2013). One goal of the proposed project is to create the Headwaters Intermittency Prediction (HIP) tool for use by land managers to provide predictions of flow permanence for user-selected headwaters streams in the study areas with potential to be expanded to predict flow permanence of any stream in the Northwest with near daily/weekly updates based on remote sensing (e.g., snow extent) data availability. The ecological value of the HIP tool will be shown by incorporating HIP output into existing vulnerability assessments for native trout across the Northwest providing novel insights into the potential consequences of spatial variation in water availability for these species as well as a timely management tool. Secondly, development of citizen science-based, low cost (&lt;$20/unit), headwater streamflow discharge estimation tools for future refinement of water availability assessments also represents a novel approach to providing large volumes of useful data and for engaging our partners (NPS) and the public at large in this effort to develop essential headwaters stream monitoring data. These products with accompanying support documentation will be developed in cooperation with EPA, Idaho Dept of Env Quality, USFS, Trout Unlimited, BLM, Sauk-Suiattle Tribe, and others.

At higher elevations, headwater streams fared no better, with numerous streams experiencing periods of \u201cno flow\u201d for the first time in recorded history. During the winter of 2014/2015 higher than average temperatures caused a transition in precipitation from snow to rain. This change in precipitation phase reduced the overall snowpack below annual means as well as caused increased runoff during late winter and early spring. Moreover, with higher temperatures the snowmelt season started earlier than normal reducing the amount of late season snowmelt available to headwater streams. The objective of this proposal is to identify key headwater streams that are the most resilient to drought as they will naturally be the streams that can best sustain threatened aquatic and terrestrial populations during future droughts. Stream permanence models incorporating remotely sensed data and basin geographical characteristics will be used to determine and predict these critical watersheds for focused management and restoration of critical aquatic species such as bull trout, redband cutthroat trout, and Lahontan cutthroat trout. Calibration of historical stream permanence models and hydrology-based ecosystem models in headwater streams are often limited in prediction capability as streamflow measurements are typically absent. This proposal includes the design of simple low-cost citizen science methods to enable a sizeable increase in the number and location of our nation\u2019s headwater streamflow estimates.

Changing ocean and atmospheric conditions are likely to reshape these ecosystems and species that rely on them. Efforts to project ecosystem change along the Pacific coast due to ecological drought and sea-level rise have largely relied on regional scale data which is not representative of local estuaries and at the scale of management decision. We propose a process-based approach to integrate data from multiple disciplines into empirical models describing current and future conditions and associated habitat changes with ecological drought and sea-level rise. This approach is transferable across coastal Climate Science Centers (CSCs) and Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). Specifically, we propose three overarching objectives: (1) Hold in-person meetings with resource managers to identify key ecological drought-sea-level rise management concerns for their estuaries, (2) Leverage and analyze long-term existing datasets of river levels and discharge rates, as well as available water quality data, to determine how drought has affected these abiotic factors historically and currently, and (3) Use data on biotic communities as they relate to drought-sensitive abiotic drivers (e.g., salinity, water temperature, nutrients, sediment), to help inform key management questions identified by resource managers within each estuary (salmonids, vegetation, etc.).

Recent technological advances in stream temperature monitoring (e.g., digital data loggers and remote sensors) and modeling have increased the amount of data that are available (both observed and projected) throughout the region. These newly available data, although exciting, have strengths and limitations depending on the purposes for which they were developed and the scale(s) at which they can be used to address management questions. For instance, a spatially expansive stream temperature dataset may be perfect for answering questions about how species distributions may change, but it may not be very good for identifying localized cold water refuges. Future projections made using statistical models may not be accurate if extrapolated to conditions not seen historically, or if applied in new areas. To address these challenges, we propose to develop a handbook for natural resource managers that will guide the selection and use of stream temperature dataset(s) that are appropriate for answering management or conservation questions. We will engage with natural resource stakeholders in the Pacific Northwest to learn about pertinent management issues, stream temperature data already in use, and information gaps. Through close collaboration with these stakeholders, we will then develop the handbook to (1) summarize benefits and tradeoffs of existing observed and projected stream temperature datasets, (2) support decisions about which datasets are most appropriate for a given management question using decision trees, and (3) provide case study examples to illustrate potential applications of the handbook.", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"contactType": "person", "email": "jcasola@uw.edu", "highlighted": true, "name": "Joseph Casola", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Washington, Climate Impacts Group"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "null", "country": "null", "line1": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null"}, "officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Principal Investigator"}, {"contactType": "organization", "name": "Northwest CSC", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Funding Agency"}], "dates": [{"dateString": "2016", "label": "Start Date", "type": "Start"}], "distributionLinks": [{"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "KML Service", "type": "kml", "typeLabel": "KML Download", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/59371d92e4b0f6c2d0d89a4b?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase WMS Service", "type": "serviceCapabilitiesUrl", "typeLabel": "OGC Service Capabilities URL", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/59371d92e4b0f6c2d0d89a4b?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection JSON", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=59371d92e4b0f6c2d0d89a4b&format=json"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection ATOM", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=59371d92e4b0f6c2d0d89a4b&format=atom"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection CSV", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=59371d92e4b0f6c2d0d89a4b&format=csv"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase OAI PMH Service", "type": "oai-pmh", "typeLabel": "OAI-PMH", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=59371d92e4b0f6c2d0d89a4b"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase CSW Service", "type": "csw", "typeLabel": "", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59371d92e4b0f6c2d0d89a4b/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords"}, {"files": [{"contentType": "image/jpeg", "name": "montana-1316643_1920.jpg", "size": 1033459, "title": "Montana Stream - Public Domain"}], "name": "InnovativeAppro.zip", "rel": "alternate", "title": "Download Attached Files", "type": "downloadLink", "typeLabel": "Download Link", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/59371d92e4b0f6c2d0d89a4b"}], "extents": [8, 43, 18], "facets": [{"className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet", "facetName": "Project", "parts": [{"type": "Technical Summary", "value": "Natural resource managers face significant challenges when applying stream temperature datasets or projections to climate adaptation efforts.

Decision makers at all scales are looking for the best scientific information to guide their decisions about adapting to and mitigating the negative effects of climate change. Development of actionable science \u2013 scientific information that can be easily used to inform these decisions \u2013 is the goal of the Northwest Climate Science Center (NW CSC) and the CSC network as a whole. There is evidence that more collaborative forms of knowledge development and exchange between researchers and decision makers (and between policy makers and the public), sometimes called co-production of knowledge, tend to produce information that is more trusted (Cash et al. 2006), considered more usable (Carbone and Dow 2005; Jasanoff and Wynne 1998; Lemos et al. 2012), and lead to higher-quality decisions about environmental management (Beierle 2002). As a community of climate researchers, we still lack a clear understanding of the specific practices or activities that are most effective in promoting co-production of knowledge (Fazey et al. 2014; Meadow et al. 2015; Reed et al. 2014); whether other paths to actionable climate science exist and are usable in the network; and we require more information and guidance on how to structure programs around the production of actionable science, which requires a different approach to research and reward systems than the standard academic model. We have developed a framework for the evaluation of collaboratively produced climate science that specifically addresses the process of producing and outcomes of actionable science. We examine factors such as when resource managers become engaged in the research process, how and when researchers and resource managers communicate and collaborate through the project, and the variety of ways findings from the research are used (or not) by resource managers at the end of the project. We propose to apply the framework to a sample of 10-12 projects funded by the NW CSC to identify barriers to the production and use of actionable climate science as well as practices that are associated with its successful production and use.

Decision makers at all scales are looking for the best scientific information to guide their decisions about adapting to and mitigating the negative effects of climate change. Development of actionable science \u2013 scientific information that can be easily used to inform these decisions \u2013 is the goal of the Northwest Climate Science Center (NW CSC) and the CSC network as a whole. There is evidence that when researchers and resource managers (or other decision makers) collaborate to find answers to questions about climate change impacts, the decision makers are more likely to trust the information and use it to inform their decisions. However, we as a community of climate researchers and decision makers are still looking for guidance about the best ways to work together \u2013 what activities, practices, or strategies are most effective in building trusting relationships and result in credible science that is applicable to key resource management decisions. And, as resource managers ask for more climate information that directly informs their decisions, we need to create more organizations that can support these efforts. We can use what we learn about developing actionable climate science in individual projects to inform the way we structure climate service provider organizations. We have developed a framework for the evaluation of collaboratively produced climate science that specifically addresses the process of producing and outcomes of actionable science. We examine factors such as when resource managers become engaged in the research process, how and when researchers and resource managers communicate and collaborate through the project, and the variety of ways findings from the research are used (or not) by resource managers at the end of the project. We propose to apply the framework to a sample of 10-12 projects funded by the NW CSC to identify barriers to the production and use of actionable climate science as well as practices that are associated with its successful production and use. We will then build on that framework to explore the role of the climate service or boundary organizations in the development of actionable science \u2013 in this case, the NW CSC.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57db0081e4b090824ffc3304"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -111.043500333, "maxY": 49.002491333, "minX": -124.733173333, "minY": 41.988009333}, "representationalPoint": [-117.888336833, 45.495250333], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Developmental Evaluation of the NW CSC: Evaluation for Learning and Innovation in Actionable Science for Climate Adaptation", "summary": "The impacts of climate change are already being observed and felt in our ecosystems and communities.

Specifically, for 39 spring clusters mapped in the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) in Harney County, Oregon, USA, these scripts process Landsat-derived NDVI and precipitation data from 1985-2011 to derive 7 potential indicators of SMZ resilience to water-cycle changes.

This study will test whether explicitly managing the urban forest canopy to reduce street runoff temperatures (TR) is an innovative and practical tool to mitigate urban contributions to urban and downstream ecological drought. This particularly innovative idea to help address ecological drought would leverage the substantial, highly managed urban forest \u201ccapital\u201d to simply address an additional variable, TR, at little additional management cost. It would also be both mitigative of ecological drought and adaptive to climate change (as some aspects of relative cooling increase with energy load).  \r\nBackground. While the urban heat island is known to raise stream temperatures even within greenspaces, data are lacking on street-level TR and its relationship to street tree canopy (STC). This is important because curbside storm drain systems of many cities in the Pacific Northwest discharge directly to cold-water aquatic ecosystems. Large quantities of rapid runoff already can create impairment in receiving waters, and elevated runoff temperature could duplicate or exacerbate climate-driven aquatic system ecological drought.   \r\nMethods. There are 4 specific objectives of this study. [1] Empirically quantify the effects of STC cover and tree type on street runoff temperature (TR) by 2 years of original field monitoring of TR within a 2x2 factorial experimental design (high/low STC cover vs. deciduous/coniferous tree types), throughout the range of weather and phenology in Portland, OR, as a pilot case study. [2] Develop a physics-based model based on 1D heat transport in a stream, but adapted to rapid, shallow stormwater flow over pavement and under intermittent shade, to predict spatially-explicit street gutter TR given variable STC, urbanization, and climate influences. [3] Predict urban tree types more likely to be healthy and beneficial (i.e., good investments) for mitigating downstream ecological drought under future climate warming stress by statistically analyzing the health of street trees in recent inventories across the PNW (\u22658 cities, \u2265334,000 trees) compared to the relative warmth of their location within the local urban heat island. [4] Compare the field and modeling with the USDA Forest Service urban forest decision-support model suite i-Tree, recommend i-Tree updates to represent currently missing TR and its relationships to STC, and add to the i-Tree Hydro module a means to assess potential TR influences on downstream ecological drought.  \r\nProducts, Partners, and Information Transfer. The field data, statistical analyses, and numerical models will be collaboratively reviewed and shared with a partner in Portland Environmental Services leading the street tree planting and education program and the originators of the PNW-wide city street tree inventories, presented at public (seminar, education, and outreach activities) and academic forums, documented in peer-reviewed manuscripts, and made publically available as per the Data Management Plan."}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}, {"annualBudgets": [{"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds":

change in the Pacific Northwest is causing lower and warmer summer stream flows that can decimate cold-water species like salmon. Impacts are particularly strong in cities, where the urban heat island can raise stream temperatures even within greenspaces. However, specifically how urban warming \u2013 or cooling, such as by tree shade \u2013 affects the temperature of stormwater runoff from streets to storm drains is surprisingly sparsely documented. This is important because storm drains of many cities in the Pacific Northwest discharge directly to cold-water aquatic ecosystems. If the runoff is very warm, it could tip salmon habitat into fatal conditions. On the other hand, urban street trees are already well known, and even managed, to help trap rainfall and reduce runoff quantity. This study will test if street trees could also be managed to help reduce runoff temperature. Data from streets in Portland, OR, will document how runoff temperature is affected by the amount and type (deciduous vs. conifer) of street trees in different locations and seasons over two years. The data will then be used to improve models of street tree benefits that already widely help plan cities\u2019 tree planting and management, but which do not yet consider runoff temperature. This project will also analyze existing databases of street trees in cities throughout the Pacific Northwest to determine if some types of trees are less healthy than others amid their urban heat island, and assess whether some tree types might be better investments given pending climate warming. The results of this project will provide missing data and decision-support information to cities throughout the region, on how to use existing street tree \u201cinfrastructure\u201d to, at little additional cost, also help reduce the negative impacts that warm urban runoff can have on aquatic ecosystems already stressed by drought and climate change.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57daeed4e4b090824ffc321c"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -122.473526000977, "maxY": 45.6543681394647, "minX": -122.830581665039, "minY": 45.4370082886739}, "representationalPoint": [-122.65205383300801, 45.5456882140693], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Managing urban tree canopy to mitigate ecological drought and urban thermal pollution above salmonid streams from concurrent climate change and urbanization", "summary": "In the Pacific Northwest, cold-water species like salmon are important for recreational sport fishing as well as for commercial fish production.

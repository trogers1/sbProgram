More than half of the Rio Grande\u2019s streamflow originates as snowmelt in Colorado\u2019s mountains, meaning that changes in the amount of snowmelt can impact the water supply for communities along the entire river. Snowmelt runoff is therefore an important component of water supply outlooks for the region, which are used by a variety of stakeholders to anticipate water availability in the springtime.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nIt is critical that these water supply outlooks be as accurate as possible. Errors can cost states millions of dollars due to mis-allocation of water and lost agricultural productivity. There is a perception that runoff forecast accuracy has declined over the last several decades in Colorado and New Mexico, making water supply outlooks less reliable. Declines in accuracy could be related to changes in climate and land cover; however, potential sources of error have not yet been examined in the upper Rio Grande basin.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis study aims to improve runoff forecast models for the upper Rio Grande. Researchers will identify potential sources of error in existing models, improve the representation of snowpack in models of the watershed, develop a new hydrologic model for the basin, and test this model\u2019s ability to forecast runoff. The end product of this study will be a tool for making improved runoff forecasts for the upper Rio Grande basin. The tool will be transferable to other snowmelt-dominated basins in the region that have similar characteristics. These improved runoff forecasts, in turn, can be used to develop more accurate water supply outlooks in the region, empowering stakeholders in the basin to plan their water use more effectively.&nbsp;</div>\n", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"contactType": "person", "email": "dwclow@usgs.gov", "highlighted": true, "name": "David Clow", "organization": {"displayText": "Colorado Water Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "Denver", "country": "USA", "line1": "Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Mail Stop 415", "state": "CO", "zip": "80225-0046"}, "officePhone": "3032366881", "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Principal Investigator"}, {"contactType": "person", "name": "Colin Penn", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Colorado WSC"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "null", "country": "null", "line1": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null"}, "officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Co-Investigator"}, {"contactType": "person", "name": "Graham Sexstone", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Colorado WSC"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "null", "country": "null", "line1": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null"}, "officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Co-Investigator"}, {"contactType": "organization", "name": "South Central CSC", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Funding Agency"}], "dates": [{"dateString": "2016-08-03", "label": "Start Date", "type": "Start"}, {"dateString": "2018-08-02", "label": "End Date", "type": "End"}], "distributionLinks": [{"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "KML Service", "type": "kml", "typeLabel": "KML Download", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/580a8ea6e4b0f497e7906c84?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase WMS Service", "type": "serviceCapabilitiesUrl", "typeLabel": "OGC Service Capabilities URL", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/580a8ea6e4b0f497e7906c84?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection JSON", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=580a8ea6e4b0f497e7906c84&format=json"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection ATOM", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=580a8ea6e4b0f497e7906c84&format=atom"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection CSV", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=580a8ea6e4b0f497e7906c84&format=csv"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase OAI PMH Service", "type": "oai-pmh", "typeLabel": "OAI-PMH", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=580a8ea6e4b0f497e7906c84"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase CSW Service", "type": "csw", "typeLabel": "", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/580a8ea6e4b0f497e7906c84/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords"}, {"files": [{"contentType": "image/jpeg", "name": "RioGrandeRiver_AlanCressler2.jpg", "size": 218252, "title": "Rio Grande River - Credit: Alan Cressler"}], "name": "DevelopingTools.zip", "rel": "alternate", "title": "Download Attached Files", "type": "downloadLink", "typeLabel": "Download Link", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8ea6e4b0f497e7906c84"}], "extents": [3100147], "facets": [{"className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet", "facetName": "Project", "parts": [{"type": "Technical Summary", "value": "Snow is a critical water resource in the western United States (U.S.).

Thus, downscaling methods have been used to add value to GCM output and provide guidance at regional and local scales. Because downscaling methods are not perfect (and there is no standard approach), there is an additional layer of uncertainty added to existing uncertainties in emissions scenarios, GCM modeling techniques, and internal climate variability. Thus, decision makers are faced with a broader range of possible futures than if only one emissions scenario, one GCM, and one downscaling method were used. The uncertainties only grow when the results of downscaling output are used as input to impact-based models (e.g., crop models, hydrologic models) to solve specific problems. As a result, it is critical to understand how to evaluate these uncertainties, how they individually and collectively change over time and space, and how their ranges affect the ability for decision makers to plan for, mitigate, and adapt to climate change impacts in their jurisdictions.

Thus, downscaling methods have been used to add value to GCM output and provide guidance at regional and local scales. Because downscaling methods are not perfect (and there is no standard approach), there is an additional layer of uncertainty added to existing uncertainties in emissions scenarios, GCM modeling techniques, and internal climate variability. Thus, decision makers are faced with a broader range of possible futures than if only one emissions scenario, one GCM, and one downscaling method were used. The uncertainties only grow when the results of downscaling output are used as input to impact-based models (e.g., crop models, hydrologic models) to solve specific problems. As a result, it is critical to understand how to evaluate these uncertainties, how they individually and collectively change over time and space, and how their ranges affect the ability for decision makers to plan for, mitigate, and adapt to climate change impacts in their jurisdictions.

We propose an analysis of historical observations and climate model projections to assess the processes that factor into annual water supply outlooks for the upper Rio Grande. Water supply outlooks are a hydrologic version of short-term climate predictions. They are strongly influenced by trends in snowpack associated with climate change, and by natural multidecadal fluctuations in winter and spring precipitation, both of which affect the expected value of streamflow following ablation of snowpack in the Rio Grande headwaters drainages. Large interannual fluctuations in post-snowmelt precipitation also affect flows and tend to limit streamflow predictability. On multidecadal climate change time scales, the effect of increasing temperature on snowpack and ET is projected to become the first-order process responsible for projections of diminished streamflow, subject to continued large interannual and decadal fluctuations of precipitation. In the proposed research these processes will be incorporated into statistical prediction models for Rio Grande streamflow, similar to the models used operationally by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service for their current operational water supply outlooks. The sensitivity of these prediction models to historical period of record will be quantified, and if possible attributed to specific components of climate variability and change. Then the statistical models will be applied to more complex climate change projections generated by coupled dynamical models. The results of the research will place constraints on the predictability of streamflow associated with winter snowpack, identify changes to streamflow predictability over the past several decades (a period of rapid observed warming), and assess future predictability."}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}, {"annualBudgets": [{"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds": 92915.0, "year": "2016"}], "className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet", "facetName": "Budget", "parts": [{"type": "Award Type", "value": "Grant"}, {"type": "Award Number", "value": "G16AP00114"}], "totalFunds": 92915.0}], "files": [{"checksum": {"type": "MD5", "value": "f1de3a782ebbcc727571760de9055008"}, "contentEncoding": null, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "dateUploaded": "2016-11-22T19:50:51Z", "downloadUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c?f=__disk__a6%2F62%2F1c%2Fa6621c3f38c93ced9f50126338a5ad153b542505", "imageHeight": 1310, "imageWidth": 1746, "name": "RioGrandeRiver_AlanCressler.jpg", "originalMetadata": false, "pathOnDisk": "__disk__a6/62/1c/a6621c3f38c93ced9f50126338a5ad153b542505", "previewImage": {"large": {"height": 750, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c?f=__disk__a6%2F62%2F1c%2Fa6621c3f38c93ced9f50126338a5ad153b542505&width=1000&height=750", "width": 1000}, "medium": {"height": 435, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c?f=__disk__a6%2F62%2F1c%2Fa6621c3f38c93ced9f50126338a5ad153b542505&width=580&height=435", "width": 580}, "small": {"height": 263, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c?f=__disk__a6%2F62%2F1c%2Fa6621c3f38c93ced9f50126338a5ad153b542505&width=350&height=263", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 113, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c?f=__disk__a6%2F62%2F1c%2Fa6621c3f38c93ced9f50126338a5ad153b542505&width=150&height=113", "width": 150}}, "processToken": null, "processed": false, "s3Object": null, "size": 618824, "title": "Rio Grande River -

Statistical models of this sort are used operationally to create water supply outlooks for the Rio Grande each year. The research proposed here will inform improvements to these outlooks in several ways. First, we will closely examine the sensitivity of these models to changes in the baseline period, to investigate whether recent climate change has affected the prediction skill of models based on historical data. Second, we will develop statistical prediction models based on climate model projections, to examine how snowpack-streamflow relationships are projected to change in ways that directly affect annual water supply outlooks. Third, we will use historical simulations of streamflow to provide a new estimate of uncertainties in water supply outlooks.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=580e2a3ae4b0f497e7946c7c"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -105.791549831629, "maxY": 37.9624256321655, "minX": -107.933883816004, "minY": 36.1654118375212}, "representationalPoint": [-106.8627168238165, 37.06391873484335], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Climate Variability, Snowpack and Streamflow in the Rio Grande Headwaters", "summary": "On its southbound course from Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico, the Rio Grande provides water resources for more than 13 million people.

More than one-half of coastal wetlands in the contiguous United States are located along the Gulf of Mexico coast. In addition to supporting fish and wildlife habitat, these highly productive wetlands support many ecosystem goods and services including storm protection, recreation, clean water, and carbon sequestration. Historically, tidal saline wetlands (TSWs) have adapted to sea-level fluctuations through lateral and vertical movement on the landscape. As sea levels rise in the future, some TSWs will adapt and migrate landward in undeveloped low-lying areas where migration corridors exist; however, where naturally occurring and human-created barriers are present (such as natural bluffs and seawalls or levees, respectively), landward wetland migration will be prevented. To sustain or manage the ecosystem goods and services provided by TSWs for current and future generations, natural resource managers and planners need to understand where TSW migration is most likely to occur under a suite of region-wide SLR and urbanization scenarios.\n</div> &nbsp;\n<br /> In this study, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, quantified the potential for TSW landward migration along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast under alternative future sea-level rise and urbanization scenarios. Our analyses focused exclusively on TSWs (that is, mangrove forests, salt marshes, and salt flats), and we combined these diverse TSW ecosystems into a single grouping, \u201ctidal saline wetland.\u201d Collectively, our approach and findings can provide useful information for scientists and environmental planners working to develop future-focused adaptation strategies for conserving coastal landscapes and TSW ecosystem goods and services. The primary product of this work is a public dataset that identifies locations where TSW landward migration is expected to occur under alternative future SLR and urbanization scenarios. In addition to identifying areas where TSW landward migration is possible because of the absence of barriers, these data also identify locations where TSW landward migration could be prevented by barriers associated with current urbanization, future urbanization, and levees. The dataset includes five time steps (2030, 2040, 2050, 2060, and 2100), five SLR scenarios (0.5-, 1.0-, 1.2-, 1.5-, and 2.0-meter [m] SLR by 2100), and three uncertainty categories, which equates to 102 total files because of the presentation of the data in two formats, as well as the various time step/scenario-uncertainty combinations.", "citation": "Enwright, N.M., Griffith, K.T., and Osland, M.J., 2015, Incorporating future change into current conservation planning\u2014Evaluating tidal saline wetland migration along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast under alternative sea-level rise and urbanization scenarios: U.S. Geological Survey Data Series 969, http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ds969.", "contacts": [{"active": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "enwrightn@usgs.gov", "firstName": "Nicholas", "jobTitle": "Geographer", "lastName": "Enwright", "middleName": "M", "name": "Nicholas M Enwright", "oldPartyId": 22708, "organization": {"displayText": "National Wetlands Research Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"building": "NWRC -

More than one-half of coastal wetlands in the contiguous United States are located along the Gulf of Mexico coast. In addition to supporting fish and wildlife habitat, these highly productive wetlands support many ecosystem goods and services including storm protection, recreation, clean water, and carbon sequestration. Historically, tidal saline wetlands (TSWs) have adapted to sea-level fluctuations through lateral and vertical movement on the landscape. As sea levels rise in the future, some TSWs will adapt and migrate landward in undeveloped low-lying areas where migration corridors exist; however, where naturally occurring and human-created barriers are present (such as natural bluffs and seawalls or levees, respectively), landward wetland migration will be prevented. To sustain or manage the ecosystem goods and services provided by TSWs for current and future generations, natural resource managers and planners need to understand where TSW migration is most likely to occur under a suite of region-wide SLR and urbanization scenarios.\n</div> &nbsp;\n<br /> In this study, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, quantified the potential for TSW landward migration along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast under alternative future sea-level rise and urbanization scenarios. Our analyses focused exclusively on TSWs (that is, mangrove forests, salt marshes, and salt flats), and we combined these diverse TSW ecosystems into a single grouping, \u201ctidal saline wetland.\u201d Collectively, our approach and findings can provide useful information for scientists and environmental planners working to develop future-focused adaptation strategies for conserving coastal landscapes and TSW ecosystem goods and services. The primary product of this work is a public dataset that identifies locations where TSW landward migration is expected to occur under alternative future SLR and urbanization scenarios. In addition to identifying areas where TSW landward migration is possible because of the absence of barriers, these data also identify locations where TSW landward migration could be prevented by barriers associated with current urbanization, future urbanization, and levees. The dataset includes five time steps (2030, 2040, 2050, 2060, and 2100), five SLR scenarios (0.5-, 1.0-, 1.2-, 1.5-, and 2.0-meter [m] SLR by 2100), and three uncertainty categories, which equates to 102 total files because of the presentation of the data in two formats, as well as the various time step/scenario-uncertainty combinations.", "browseCategories": ["Data"], "browseTypes": ["ArcGIS

More than one-half of coastal wetlands in the contiguous United States are located along the Gulf of Mexico coast. In addition to supporting fish and wildlife habitat, these highly productive wetlands support many ecosystem goods and services including storm protection, recreation, clean water, and carbon sequestration. Historically, tidal saline wetlands (TSWs) have adapted to sea-level fluctuations through lateral and vertical movement on the landscape. As sea levels rise in the future, some TSWs will adapt and migrate landward in undeveloped low-lying areas where migration corridors exist; however, where naturally occurring and human-created barriers are present (such as natural bluffs and seawalls or levees, respectively), landward wetland migration will be prevented. To sustain or manage the ecosystem goods and services provided by TSWs for current and future generations, natural resource managers and planners need to understand where TSW migration is most likely to occur under a suite of region-wide SLR and urbanization scenarios.\n</div> &nbsp;\n<br /> In this study, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, quantified the potential for TSW landward migration along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast under alternative future sea-level rise and urbanization scenarios. Our analyses focused exclusively on TSWs (that is, mangrove forests, salt marshes, and salt flats), and we combined these diverse TSW ecosystems into a single grouping, \u201ctidal saline wetland.\u201d Collectively, our approach and findings can provide useful information for scientists and environmental planners working to develop future-focused adaptation strategies for conserving coastal landscapes and TSW ecosystem goods and services. The primary product of this work is a public dataset that identifies locations where TSW landward migration is expected to occur under alternative future SLR and urbanization scenarios. In addition to identifying areas where TSW landward migration is possible because of the absence of barriers, these data also identify locations where TSW landward migration could be prevented by barriers associated with current urbanization, future urbanization, and levees. The dataset includes five time steps (2030, 2040, 2050, 2060, and 2100), five SLR scenarios (0.5-, 1.0-, 1.2-, 1.5-, and 2.0-meter [m] SLR by 2100), and three uncertainty categories, which equates to 102 total files because of the presentation of the data in two formats, as well as the various time step/scenario-uncertainty combinations.", "browseCategories": ["Data"], "browseTypes":

More than one-half of coastal wetlands in the contiguous United States are located along the Gulf of Mexico coast. In addition to supporting fish and wildlife habitat, these highly productive wetlands support many ecosystem goods and services including storm protection, recreation, clean water, and carbon sequestration. Historically, tidal saline wetlands (TSWs) have adapted to sea-level fluctuations through lateral and vertical movement on the landscape. As sea levels rise in the future, some TSWs will adapt and migrate landward in undeveloped low-lying areas where migration corridors exist; however, where naturally occurring and human-created barriers are present (such as natural bluffs and seawalls or levees, respectively), landward wetland migration will be prevented. To sustain or manage the ecosystem goods and services provided by TSWs for current and future generations, natural resource managers and planners need to understand where TSW migration is most likely to occur under a suite of region-wide SLR and urbanization scenarios.\n</div> &nbsp;\n<br /> In this study, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, quantified the potential for TSW landward migration along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast under alternative future sea-level rise and urbanization scenarios. Our analyses focused exclusively on TSWs (that is, mangrove forests, salt marshes, and salt flats), and we combined these diverse TSW ecosystems into a single grouping, \u201ctidal saline wetland.\u201d Collectively, our approach and findings can provide useful information for scientists and environmental planners working to develop future-focused adaptation strategies for conserving coastal landscapes and TSW ecosystem goods and services. The primary product of this work is a public dataset that identifies locations where TSW landward migration is expected to occur under alternative future SLR and urbanization scenarios. In addition to identifying areas where TSW landward migration is possible because of the absence of barriers, these data also identify locations where TSW landward migration could be prevented by barriers associated with current urbanization, future urbanization, and levees. The dataset includes five time steps (2030, 2040, 2050, 2060, and 2100), five SLR scenarios (0.5-, 1.0-, 1.2-, 1.5-, and 2.0-meter [m] SLR by 2100), and three uncertainty categories, which equates to 102 total files because of the presentation of the data in two formats, as well as the various time step/scenario-uncertainty combinations.", "browseCategories": ["Data"], "browseTypes": ["ArcGIS

This project was a multi-Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) project that included the four Gulf coast LCCs (i.e., Gulf Coast Prairie, Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks, South Atlantic, and Peninsular Florida LCCs). The products and analyses from this work were produced at the region scale (i.e., all five Gulf coast states). However, there is much potential to use these data for customized analyses focused on landscape conservation design within specific estuaries (e.g., estuaries that contain ecologically-significant National Wildlife Refuges, National Estuarine Research Reserves, National Estuary Programs). Here we will perform follow-up work focused on the evaluation of landward migration corridors. We will work with LCC staff and partners from the four Gulf coast LCCs to identify 1-2 estuaries per LCC (4-8 estuaries total) for customized analyses. Within each of these estuaries, we will work with these partners to produce customized landscape conservation-design products focused on landward migration corridors for coastal wetlands. In broad terms, the aim of the proposed work is to provide scientific information that can be used by environmental managers to enhance the adaptive capacity of coastal wetlands in the face of sea-level rise and coastal development. The two PIs for this project are both at the USGS Wetland and Aquatic Research Center. The project will provide valuable experience and opportunities for two early-career researchers (a recent M.S. graduate and a current Ph.D. student). The formal products of the proposed research will include, at a minimum, a peer-reviewed publication and a webinar for natural resource managers."}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}], "files": [{"checksum": {"type": "MD5", "value": "a46fa2b501ee68c5d65b648f34ce4ab0"}, "contentEncoding": null, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "dateUploaded": "2016-10-25T18:03:18Z", "downloadUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a", "imageHeight": 683, "imageWidth": 910, "name": "EvergladesNP2_AlanCressler.jpg", "originalMetadata": false, "pathOnDisk": "__disk__c9/a2/8c/c9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a", "previewImage": {"medium": {"height": 435, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a&width=580&height=435", "width": 580}, "small": {"height": 263, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a&width=350&height=263", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 113, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a&width=150&height=113", "width": 150}}, "processToken": null, "processed": false, "s3Object": null, "size": 216551, "title": "Everglades National Park - Credit: Alan Cressler", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a", "useForPreview": true, "viewUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a&width=910&height=683"}], "hasChildren": true, "id": "580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a", "identifiers": [{"key": "d5f17552-eb33-4408-8dbe-baa7d4799a92", "scheme": "NCCWSC", "type": "RegistrationUUID"}, {"key": "SC16-OM0724", "scheme": "NCCWSC", "type": "StampID"}], "link": {"rel": "self", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a"}, "parentId": "580f9a22e4b0f497e796004b", "previewImage": {"alternateImages": [{"from": "mapPreview", "original": {"height": 240, "size": 150629, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__ab%2F90%2Fde%2Fab90deb98c14508ed5ea77df818c62309b745ea2", "viewUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__ab%2F90%2Fde%2Fab90deb98c14508ed5ea77df818c62309b745ea2&width=360&height=240", "viewUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?deprecated=__use__viewUri__instead__&f=__disk__ab%2F90%2Fde%2Fab90deb98c14508ed5ea77df818c62309b745ea2&width=360&height=240", "width": 360}, "thumbnail": {"height": 100, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__ab%2F90%2Fde%2Fab90deb98c14508ed5ea77df818c62309b745ea2&width=150&height=100", "width": 150}}], "from": "attachedFile", "medium": {"height": 435, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a&width=580&height=435", "width": 580}, "original": {"height": 683, "size": 216551, "title": "Everglades National Park - Credit: Alan Cressler", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a", "viewUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a&width=910&height=683", "viewUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?deprecated=__use__viewUri__instead__&f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a&width=910&height=683", "width": 910}, "small": {"height": 263, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a&width=350&height=263", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 113, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a?f=__disk__c9%2Fa2%2F8c%2Fc9a28cb8d052515032f5244ddc5caea9c5ed3a8a&width=150&height=113", "width": 150}}, "provenance": {"dateCreated": "2016-10-21T21:53:53Z", "harvesterCode": "rfpManager-2.2.19 gov.usgs.eventManager.ScienceBaseService.store()", "lastUpdated": "2017-12-06T22:29:45Z"}, "purpose": "In the 21st century, accelerated sea-level rise and coastal development are expected to greatly alter coastal landscapes across the globe.

What aspects of soil temperature can be modified to maintain soil health and sustainability for agricultural systems? Hoe does drought impact the sustainability of agroecosystems? While we collect and monitor soil temperatures across natural and managed ecosystems, we do not have a clear understanding of how soil temperature parameters are linked to ecosystem services, soil health and sustainability for agroecosystems under increasing climate variability and increasing drought severity. Understanding how management decisions will either create positive or negative feedback loops with respect to soil temperature dynamics may be critical for developing sound conservation and soil management practices. One component of soil temperature dynamics that has been shown previously to be critical for enhancing soil microbial dynamics in arid and semi-arid ecosystems is Daily Temperature Range (DTR). Developing a broad understanding of the importance of DTRsoil for soil health, agricultural sustainability and conservation management needs will be critical towards developing management decisions that do not inadvertently create negative feedback loops.

Researchers at Texas Tech University found that lower daily temperature ranges of soil in the Southern High Plains were associated with higher levels of soil microbes (which help make critical nutrients available for plants) and decreased nitrogen availability. These results suggest that climate variability may have implications for soil health and microbial content. In the South Central U.S., a more developed understanding of how management practices, climate variability, and soil health interact is essential for sound agricultural decision-making.

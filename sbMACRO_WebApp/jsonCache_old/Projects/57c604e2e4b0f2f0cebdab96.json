Healthy forests also provide needed habitat for many wildlife species and contribute many other important services to our planet. \u201cHotter droughts\u201d (otherwise normal droughts whose effects on ecosystems are exacerbated by higher temperatures) are an emerging climate change threat to forests with some of their earliest and strongest appearances happening in the Southwest. The Leaf to Landscape project uses California\u2019s unusually hot drought as a potential preview of the future, allowing us to collect information that will help guide forest management in the face of a warming climate.

These changes have implications for the phenology, or the timing of natural life events (e.g. the timing of plant flowering in Spring or leaves falling in Autumn), of many plant species. However, not all species and regions are changing at the same rate, which can lead to mismatches (e.g. between the emergence of plants and pollinators in early spring). Many interactions in nature depend on timing and, as such, phenology affects nearly all aspects of the environment, including the abundance, distribution, and diversity of organisms, ecosystem services, food webs, even global water [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Seth Munson", "type": "Principal Investigator", "highlighted": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "smunson@usgs.gov", "organization": {"displayText": "USGS Southwest Biological Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"officePhone": "9285237740", "streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {"line1": "Northern Arizona University 525 S.

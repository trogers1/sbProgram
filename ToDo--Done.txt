* MUST deal with if the user does not select a fiscal year.
* FIX FISCAL YEAR SELECTION! Why is it always doing 2016?
- - Not still a problem??
* Fix table when there is a lot of data per file...
- - Add elipses to any large decimal number cell.
* Data in Project and Data per File does not appear correct. Appears to be increasing like a running total of something.
* Make side bar change color depending on page you are on with jquery
* Change table row hover color to not match the striping
* Running Fiscal year total is not resetting.
* Graphs: Add different colors for different fiscal years?
* Different CSCs but same fiscal year only gives one fiscal year bar in the graph.
* Create a script to have a json of fiscal years to populate index without contacting sciencebase. Maybe after the hard search, it goes through the jsons and grabs the FYs? Maybe it just checks for a new one at the beginning of the hard search?
* Remove item report. Not useful. 
      - Actually, just grey out mixed and item boxes
* Add home splash page.
* Add project functionality

project functionality:
* Add ability to delete a url from list

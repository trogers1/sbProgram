To Do on MACRO:
* Figure out global exceptions
* Check out why, after logging in, it wants to publically search
* empty exceptions sheet has: "
      Exceptions raised:

      Empty DataFrame
      Columns: [Exception/Permission Issue ID, Exception/Permission Issue URL]
      Index: []
      "
* 'g.[something]' is a special flask object. May have to change g.py to something else and update everything.
-- OR "from flask import g as [whatever I want to call it]" so I don't have to change any of the code.
* Check out ExcelPrint had the ability to call editGPY.py to edit the memory before creating the excel sheet.
   could be good functionality or not. Need to decide.
* Figure out how to create a download from the site.
- - Perhaps it will be some SQL database that would then be used to create an excel file?
* Why is loading GIF not working???
* It looks like variables may not reset after the process is done. That could be an issue.
* Flash messages during loading (or have loading be te project that's being counted)
* work on passing data to javascript, then using js to display in interesting ways (graphs, etc.)
- - Or maybe python statistical graphics

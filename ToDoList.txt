To Do on MACRO:

!*Honestly, I should refactor the dataCounting and g1.py scripts to use classes similar to ExcelPrint, rather than lists. But it works now, so it's fine for now.

* Figure out global exceptions
* Check out why, after logging in, it wants to publically search
* empty exceptions sheet has: "
      Exceptions raised:

      Empty DataFrame
      Columns: [Exception/Permission Issue ID, Exception/Permission Issue URL]
      Index: []
      "
* 'g.[something]' is a special flask object. May have to change g.py to something else and update everything.
-- OR "from flask import g as [whatever I want to call it]" so I don't have to change any of the code.
* Check out ExcelPrint had the ability to call editGPY.py to edit the memory before creating the excel sheet.
   could be good functionality or not. Need to decide.
* Figure out how to create a download from the site.
- - Perhaps it will be some SQL database that would then be used to create an excel file?
* Why is loading GIF not working???
* It looks like variables may not reset after the process is done. That could be an issue.
* Flash messages during loading (or have loading be te project that's being counted)
-- Maybe have a hidden div that pops up during loading with the flash messages.
* work on passing data to javascript, then using js to display in interesting ways (graphs, etc.)
- - Or maybe python statistical graphics
* maybe should add a radio button to do both a single FY and all FYs file with excel.
* Will need to also figure out how to download each file (a zip of all, or each as they come, etc.)
- - Could instead re-write the ExcelPrint.py to create a new sheet for each fiscal year if they choose that option.
* Instead of printing to the console, have the program print to a log txt file and save it at the end. It can rewrite it every time. Then we have a log of the most recent stuff.
- - Also, could have it append to end of file and rewrite every 5 times it has been run or something.


Security:
* Should be using JSON.parse, and should always escape HTML anything that is being printed on the browser.
* Understand and implement Sanitization, Validation, and Escaping for web security.
* Look up making a web app secure. Do those things.

To Do on MACRO:

!*Honestly, I should refactor the dataCounting and g1.py scripts to use classes similar to ExcelPrint, rather than lists. But it works now, so it's fine for now.

* Figure out global exceptions
* Check out why, after logging in, it wants to publically search
* empty exceptions sheet has: "
      Exceptions raised:

      Empty DataFrame
      Columns: [Exception/Permission Issue ID, Exception/Permission Issue URL]
      Index: []
      "
* 'g.[something]' is a special flask object. May have to change g.py to something else and update everything.
-- OR "from flask import g as [whatever I want to call it]" so I don't have to change any of the code.
* Check out ExcelPrint had the ability to call editGPY.py to edit the memory before creating the excel sheet.
   could be good functionality or not. Need to decide.
* Figure out how to create a download from the site.
- - Perhaps it will be some SQL database that would then be used to create an excel file?
* Why is loading GIF not working???
* It looks like variables may not reset after the process is done. That could be an issue.
* Flash messages during loading (or have loading be te project that's being counted)
-- Maybe have a hidden div that pops up during loading with the flash messages.
* work on passing data to javascript, then using js to display in interesting ways (graphs, etc.)
- - Or maybe python statistical graphics
* maybe should add a radio button to do both a single FY and all FYs file with excel.
* Will need to also figure out how to download each file (a zip of all, or each as they come, etc.)
- - Could instead re-write the ExcelPrint.py to create a new sheet for each fiscal year if they choose that option.
* Instead of printing to the console, have the program print to a log txt file and save it at the end. It can rewrite it every time. Then we have a log of the most recent stuff.
- - Also, could have it append to end of file and rewrite every 5 times it has been run or something.
* Figure out creating a table per fiscal year or not... Right now parseFY.whatNext() does selection poorly (missing doing one sheet for everything?)
* Catch and deal with exceptions through the GUI or set a default wait action.
* Figure out how to reset entire script/wipe memory on a refresh. All variables need reset when it's done, and gl needs cleared when it's started.
* Would be nice to flash one message at a time about what it's doing so you know it's working during long loading times.
* MUST deal with if the user does not select a fiscal year.
* Fix so you can do multiple fiscal years
* I wonder if there's a way to speed things up by caching the fiscal years or something and just checking to see if they're different. 
- - Maybe same for download/table info?
* Instead of actual query, cache a result for each fiscal year at some point in teh morning. Have advanced ooption to do a hard search, otherwise serve up cached one for each day. Can also be done for projects. 
- - In this json file, add a new section that puts the time and date that the search was done so we can keep track and make sure it's recent.
* FIX FISCAL YEAR SELECTION! Why is it always doing 2016?
* Fix missing and exception lists/reporting in ExcelPrint?
* Add type of report to ExcelPrint (Fiscal Year, Project, Item)
* Refactor hard_search vs handle_data in app.py
* When doing 'hard search' add every project folder to a list to create json's from? Or just have a list of big ones to be executed?
* Perhaps should delete contents of jsonCache folder each time I do the full hard search (but NOT each time the advanced hard search is activated manually)
* Must find a way to mark the fiscal years in their jsons. Probably under 'identity'
* when starting Hard Search, should check each item for a matching json, and see if it was done that day, if so, don't do it.
* should recurse through hard_search() IF there are jsons in jsonCache that have a date['date'] that is not datetime.date.now().
* Why did SWCSC FY 2016 have no data per file, but data in the fiscal year??
- - I should just double check ALL data.
* Fix table when there is a lot of data per file...
* Data in Project and Data per File does not appear correct. Appears to be increasing like a running total of something.
* Make side bar change color depending on page you are on with jquery
* Round numbers when placed to table
* Find cool ways to add to 
* Add other CSCs
* DMP editor connection to say whether something has been approved or not.
- - Query active projects based on time period?? Approved?

Security:
* Should be using JSON.parse, and should always escape HTML anything that is being printed on the browser.
* Understand and implement Sanitization, Validation, and Escaping for web security.
* Look up making a web app secure. Do those things.

To Do on MACRO:

!*Honestly, I should refactor the dataCounting and g1.py scripts to use classes similar to ExcelPrint, rather than lists. But it works now, so it's fine for now.

* Figure out global exceptions
* Add functionality to parse and display:
      - projects
      - items
      - mixed bag
  All this should branch from the current functions in parseMain.
* [CLI] Check out why, after logging in, it wants to publically search
* empty exceptions sheet has: "
      Exceptions raised:

      Empty DataFrame
      Columns: [Exception/Permission Issue ID, Exception/Permission Issue URL]
      Index: []
      "
* Figure out how to create a download from the site.
- - Perhaps it will be some SQL database that would then be used to create an excel file?
* Fix loading GIF positioning
* It looks like variables may not reset after the process is done. That could be an issue.
- - Not sure this is still the case. I think not.
* Flash messages during loading (or have loading be te project that's being counted)
-- Maybe have a hidden div that pops up during loading with the flash messages.
* work on passing data to javascript, then using js to display in interesting ways (graphs, etc.)
- - Or maybe python statistical graphics
* maybe should add a radio button to do both a single FY and all FYs file with excel.
- - Need to make those buttons do something. Currently all goes to one table, Need to make it so that it could create a totally new table with Excel option and everything.
* Will need to also figure out how to download .xlxs (a zip of all, or each depending on selection, etc.)
- - Could instead re-write the ExcelPrint.py to create a new sheet for each fiscal year if they choose that option.
* Instead of printing to the console, have the program print to a log txt file and save it at the end. It can rewrite it every time. Then we have a log of the most recent stuff.
- - Also, could have it append to end of file and rewrite every 5 times it has been run or something.
* Adding Missing and Exception tables at the end?
* Catch and deal with exceptions through the GUI or set a default wait action.
- - We have a default "wait 5 min" action. Satisfactory?
* Figure out how to reset entire script/wipe memory on a refresh. All variables need reset when it's done, and gl needs cleared when it's started.
- - Check that this is happening.
* Would be nice to flash one message at a time about what it's doing so you know it's working during long loading times.
* MUST deal with if the user does not select a fiscal year.
* FIX FISCAL YEAR SELECTION! Why is it always doing 2016?
- - Not still a problem??
* [CLI] Add types of report to ExcelPrint (Fiscal Year, Project, Item)
* Refactor hard_search vs handle_data in app.py
* When doing 'hard search' add every project folder to a list to create json's from? Or just have a list of big ones to be executed?
* Perhaps should delete contents of jsonCache folder each time I do the full hard search (but NOT each time the advanced hard search is activated manually)
- - Or just do each item if not done that day and overwrite, which is what we do currently
* when starting Hard Search, should check each item for a matching json, and see if it was done that day, if so, don't do it.
- - Double check this is working properly
* should recurse through hard_search() IF there are jsons in jsonCache that have a date['date'] that is not datetime.date.now().
- - Must have exceptions handled globally to allow this to be useful
* Why did SWCSC FY 2016 have no data per file, but data in the fiscal year??
- - I should just double check ALL data.
* Fix table when there is a lot of data per file...
- - Add elipses to any large decimal number cell.
* Data in Project and Data per File does not appear correct. Appears to be increasing like a running total of something.
* Make side bar change color depending on page you are on with jquery
* Round numbers when placed to table (or add elipses)
* Find cool ways to display info graphically from table
* Add other CSCs
* DMP editor connection to say whether something has been approved or not.
- - Query active projects based on time period?? Approved?
* Change table row hover color to not match the striping
* Running Fiscal year total is not resetting.
* Make "Data Per File" more useful?


Security:
* Should be using JSON.parse, and should always escape HTML anything that is being printed on the browser.
* Understand and implement Sanitization, Validation, and Escaping for web security.
* Look up making a web app secure. Do those things.

# SciencBase Program (under construction)

This is a program meant to work with the SciencBase.gov REST API to do things like count data, search, etc. Current iteration of the project can search ScienceBase and print results to the console. I am currently working on getting accurate data counts for a specific Fiscal Year.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
Download the scripts that you wish to run. Make sure you are running Python 3 or have it converted to Python 2 syntax. Thus far, you only need to have the correct libraries installed (see below) and run the script in whatever console/terminal/command line you prefer.

### Prerequisites

Libraries you need to run this program:
* requests
* pysb
* pprint
* pandas
* openpyxl
* json
* pprint

On windows, for most of these you will just need to type:

```
py -3 -m pip install <name>
```

However, some come pre-installed on python.

To install pysb, follow instructions here: https://my.usgs.gov/bitbucket/projects/SBE/repos/pysb/browse

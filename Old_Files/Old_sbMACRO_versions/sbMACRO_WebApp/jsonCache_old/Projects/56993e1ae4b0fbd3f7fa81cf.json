Understanding climatic and ecosystem processes at meso-, topo-, and micro-scales is limited, and constrains our ability to accurately evaluate vulnerability, and assess responses under future climates. Of special interest for climate studies are upper subalpine forests, the alpine treeline ecotone, and the alpine zones. We will use case-study ecosystems to address climatic processes and ecological responses at topo- and micro-scales, including: 1) treeline ecotone and role of phenotypic plasticity in Pinus albicaulis, 2) rocky ecosystems and  Ochotona princeps, 3) demography of subalpine Pinus flexilis throughout [...]", "contacts": [{"name": "Connie Millar", "type": "Principal Investigator", "contactType": "person", "organization": {"displayText": "U.S. Forest Service"}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "contactType": "organization", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"streetAddress": {}, "mailAddress": {}}}], "history": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "DMP": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Potential_Products": "Project not currently tracked by Data Steward", "Received_Products": {"Items": {"Project_Item_List": [], "Project_Item_Count": 0}, "Files": {"Project_File_Count": 0, "Project_File_List": []}}}

Soil moisture influences wildfire activity because of its influence on vegetation characteristics and live fuel moisture. However, soil moisture is not currently used operationally for wildfire prediction because data are unavailable at the appropriate scales of space and time. This project will (1) develop effective soil moisture models for South Central river basins using digital soil maps, gridded climate data, and satellite vegetation indices; (2) quantify the relationships between modeled soil moisture and wildfire probability; and (3) develop and distribute soil moisture and wildfire probability maps for the Red River (RR) and Rio Grande (RG) basins. Background: High spatial variability of soil properties complicates spatial predictions of soil moisture; however, existing soil survey information can be linked with distributed climate data to improve soil moisture estimates. Soil moisture exerts strong influence on vegetation properties and subsequently on wildfire occurrence. Procedures/Methods: We will integrate existing soil and climate data to model the fraction of available water (FAW) present in the root zone at daily time steps and 250-m spatial resolution with a novel approach utilizing existing drought indices re-scaled to track available in situ soil moisture data. We will then demonstrate how the newly generated FAW maps, along with traditional meteorological variables, can be used to develop dynamic fire probability maps in the RR and RG basins. Expected Products and Information/ Technology Transfer: Products generated will include soil moisture models, FAW and wildfire data sets for the 2000-2016 period, and selected maps of FAW and wildfire probability along with peer-reviewed manuscripts and presentations and a website for distribution. Personnel/Cooperators/Partners: Our interdisciplinary research team is comprised of soil scientists, hydrologists, climatologists, and ecologists from Oklahoma State University, USGS, and USDA-ARS, with additional cooperators including USDA Climate Hubs, OK-FIRE, USFS, The Nature Conservancy, New Mexico State University, Texas A&amp;M Forest Service, and support from the Southern Rockies, Desert, Great Plains, and Gulf Coast Prairie LCCs."}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}, {"annualBudgets": [{"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds": 40985.0, "year": "2017"}], "className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet", "facetName": "Budget", "parts": [], "totalFunds": 40985.0}], "files": [{"checksum": {"type": "MD5", "value": "dd7de3b2732cd18a942ac110ea974641"}, "contentEncoding": null, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "dateUploaded": "2017-10-17T20:13:46Z", "downloadUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/594aa23de4b062508e36f43c?f=__disk__0c%2Fda%2Fff%2F0cdaff3557c56536368d5b0666ee3a78b8d1901e", "imageHeight": 1198, "imageWidth": 1598, "name": "BlackForestFire_CO_USDA.jpg", "originalMetadata": false, "pathOnDisk": "__disk__0c/da/ff/0cdaff3557c56536368d5b0666ee3a78b8d1901e", "previewImage": {"large": {"height": 750, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/594aa23de4b062508e36f43c?f=__disk__0c%2Fda%2Fff%2F0cdaff3557c56536368d5b0666ee3a78b8d1901e&width=1000&height=750", "width": 1000}, "medium": {"height": 435, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/594aa23de4b062508e36f43c?f=__disk__0c%2Fda%2Fff%2F0cdaff3557c56536368d5b0666ee3a78b8d1901e&width=580&height=435", "width": 580}, "small": {"height": 262, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/594aa23de4b062508e36f43c?f=__disk__0c%2Fda%2Fff%2F0cdaff3557c56536368d5b0666ee3a78b8d1901e&width=350&height=262", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 112, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/594aa23de4b062508e36f43c?f=__disk__0c%2Fda%2Fff%2F0cdaff3557c56536368d5b0666ee3a78b8d1901e&width=150&height=112", "width": 150}}, "processToken": null, "processed": false, "s3Object": null, "size": 600311, "title": "Black Forest Fire in Colorado;

The modeling framework developed to address these objectives will be relevant not just to the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico, but also forested regions globally with snow-water resources that overlap potential burn areas. Background: Snow accounts for approximately 70% of total streamflow from the region\u2019s primary water arteries, the Colorado River and Rio Grande. Forests within these watersheds are affected by climate change, modifications in land management, and a variety of natural disturbances such as wildfire and bark beetle attacks, all of which create uncertainty regarding the fate of this major water source. No studies have characterized or quantified the effects of forest fire on snow-water resources under a range of meteorological conditions that represent potential future climate scenarios. Until recently, forest snow models have been ill equipped to accurately quantify under-canopy snow accumulation and melt processes as they relate to the overlying forest canopy structure. Without tools to simulate and analyze potential impacts of wildfire on snow-water resources, effective water-resource planning, watershed protection, post-wildfire risk assessments, and future forest gap and growth analyses will have limited scientific basis or applicability in regions with wildfire potential. In order to better constrain forest-snow processes, a new snow-melt model has been developed that directly integrates LiDAR data for a high resolution representation of the modeling domain. A new process-based snow-interception model has also been developed that integrates LiDAR data to characterize the forest canopy. Methods: The snow-melt and interception model will be coupled. This will allow, for the first time, an accurate estimation of the effects of wildfire burn areas on snow-water resources under current and potential future meteorological conditions (representing the natural inter-annual variability in meteorological conditions and future climate trends). This model will be applied within the Valles Caldera National Preserve in the Jemez River Basin due to the unique availability of both a pre- and post-wildfire aerial LiDAR dataset. These datasets overlap approximately 200 km2 of the wildfire-damaged area from the high intensity Las Conchas fire (June 2011). Expected Products / Transfer: Deliverables include but are not limited to international scientific indexing journal article(s), conference presentations / affiliated proceedings and stakeholder presentations and meetings. The NWS plans on employing the results of this study to improve their forecasting capabilities in snowmelt-driven basins that have been impacted by wildfire (see attached letter of support). Also, study results will inform further research topics such as: snow feedbacks on forest evolution; impact of forest management scenarios on water resources; and methods to optimize snow-water resources after forest disturbance.

Complementing this water supply planning work, project staff will collaborate with the United States Geographical Survey (USGS) to investigate the impacts of drought on fish species, determine changes in occupancy and the potential of ecosystems to repopulate with key species following very dry conditions."}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}, {"annualBudgets": [{"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds": 62698.0, "year": "2017"}], "className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet", "facetName": "Budget", "parts": [], "totalFunds": 62698.0}], "files": [{"checksum": {"type": "MD5", "value": "5a2a86307c1ffca64658e9a07bd8da11"}, "contentEncoding": null, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "dateUploaded": "2017-10-17T20:40:16Z", "downloadUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/594aa2bce4b062508e36f45a?f=__disk__55%2Fa5%2F15%2F55a5154c96c83249267495bbee932912c3278f07", "imageHeight": 2848, "imageWidth": 4272, "name": "Tishomingo NWR_Oklahoma_AlanCressler.jpg", "originalMetadata": false, "pathOnDisk": "__disk__55/a5/15/55a5154c96c83249267495bbee932912c3278f07", "previewImage": {"large": {"height": 667, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/594aa2bce4b062508e36f45a?f=__disk__55%2Fa5%2F15%2F55a5154c96c83249267495bbee932912c3278f07&width=1000&height=667", "width": 1000}, "medium": {"height": 387, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/594aa2bce4b062508e36f45a?f=__disk__55%2Fa5%2F15%2F55a5154c96c83249267495bbee932912c3278f07&width=580&height=387", "width": 580}, "small": {"height": 233, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/594aa2bce4b062508e36f45a?f=__disk__55%2Fa5%2F15%2F55a5154c96c83249267495bbee932912c3278f07&width=350&height=233", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 100, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/594aa2bce4b062508e36f45a?f=__disk__55%2Fa5%2F15%2F55a5154c96c83249267495bbee932912c3278f07&width=150&height=100", "width": 150}}, "processToken": null, "processed": false, "s3Object": null, "size": 8501378, "title": "Tishomingo National Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma;

Resource managers face the challenge of apportioning scarce water resources among competing uses, but they lack a systematic framework for comparing the costs and benefits of proposed water management decisions and conservation actions.<br>\n<br>\nIn 2016, Co-PIs Neeson and Moreno were funded by the Great Plains LCC to develop a decision support model for identifying the most cost-effective water conservation alternatives across the Red River basin. Here, we propose to extend this optimization model in three significant ways to support cost-effective conservation decisions in the face of climate change and drought. First, we will incorporate SC CSC-developed predictions of rainfall, runoff, and stream flows through the year 2099 into our hydrologic database. Using this database, our enhanced optimization model will enable decision-makers to visualize and evaluate multiple competing water use scenarios under future drought conditions. Second, we will use SC-CSC predictions of stream flows and temperature through the year 2099 to estimate the future distributions of 28 fish species of conservation concern across the Red River. These future distribution maps will enable conservation practitioners to proactively manage species projected to be at greatest risk from declining water availability. Third, we will extend our optimization model to enable decision-makers to explicitly quantify trade-offs between competing water uses and ecological outcomes under multiple use scenarios. In doing so, our optimization model will provide resource managers with a means to identify conservation strategies that maximize outcomes for Great Plains stream ecosystems while meeting growing societal needs for water.", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"contactType": "person", "email": "neeson@ou.edu", "highlighted": true, "name": "Thomas Neeson", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Oklahoma"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "Norman", "country": "null", "line1": "100 East Boyd", "state": "Oklahoma", "zip": "73019"}, "officePhone": "1-608-338-2235", "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Principal Investigator"}, {"contactType": "person", "name": "Hernan Moreno", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Oklahoma"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "null", "country": "null", "line1": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null"}, "officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Co-Investigator"}, {"contactType": "person", "name": "Hamed Zamani Sabzi", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Oklahoma"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "null", "country": "null", "line1": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null"}, "officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Co-Investigator"}, {"contactType": "organization", "name": "South Central CSC", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Funding Agency"}], "dates": [{"dateString": "2017-08", "label": "Start Date", "type": "Start"}, {"dateString": "2019-07", "label": "End Date", "type": "End"}], "distributionLinks": [{"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "KML Service", "type": "kml", "typeLabel": "KML Download", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/594aa28de4b062508e36f450?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase WMS Service", "type": "serviceCapabilitiesUrl", "typeLabel": "OGC Service Capabilities URL", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/594aa28de4b062508e36f450?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection JSON", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=594aa28de4b062508e36f450&format=json"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection ATOM", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=594aa28de4b062508e36f450&format=atom"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection CSV", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=594aa28de4b062508e36f450&format=csv"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase OAI PMH Service", "type": "oai-pmh", "typeLabel": "OAI-PMH", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=594aa28de4b062508e36f450"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase CSW Service", "type": "csw", "typeLabel": "", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/594aa28de4b062508e36f450/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords"}, {"files": [{"contentType": "image/jpeg", "name": "LakeTexoma_EricTurner.jpg", "size": 344118, "title": "Lake Texoma, Eric Turner"}], "name": "BalancingWaterU.zip", "rel": "alternate", "title": "Download Attached Files", "type": "downloadLink", "typeLabel": "Download Link", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/594aa28de4b062508e36f450"}], "extents": [3136613], "facets": [{"className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet", "facetName": "Project", "parts": [{"type": "Technical Summary", "value": "Resource managers in the Red River basin face the challenge of apportioning scarce water resources among competing uses, but they lack a systematic framework for comparing the costs and benefits of proposed water management decisions and conservation actions.

Providing opportunities for water resource managers to share experiences, innovate, solve problems, develop new knowledge structures, and learn from others working on similar issues in different Tribal Nations and Pueblos would ultimately build capacity and climate science literacy within all participating Nations in the region. We will use project funding to launch, establish, and build the proposed Tribal Water Manager learning community. We will study our process of establishing this unique learning community with attention to the particular needs of the Tribal members, using mixed-methodology (qualitative and quantitative data sources) to contribute to the general understanding of the educational research knowledge. As the project organizers, we will explore our own practice, as well as conduct interviews with select participants, including both singular and paired discussions. We will collect quantitative survey data to better understand how participation in the learning community influences each individual, and the group as a whole. Our project team includes one education researcher (PI Yunker), a sustainability scientist and Tribal Liaison affiliated with the SC CSC (co-PI Taylor), an environmental protection specialist in the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma (co-PI Merryman), a professor in Geography and Environmental Sustainability (co-PI McPherson), and the executive director of the Flower Hill Institute (co-PI Fragua).

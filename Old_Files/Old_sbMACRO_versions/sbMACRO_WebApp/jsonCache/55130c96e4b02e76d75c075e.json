Remote sensing data are a powerful tool to help delineate available wetland habitat to assess progress towards conservation objectives within a management year and to measure the effect of drought, as well as other drivers, on wetland availability. New and ongoing research is quantifying how the spatio-temporal patterns of wetland habitat availability in the Central Valley (San Joaquin River and Sacramento River Basins; Point Blue and NDVI, USFWS). Understanding these habitat dynamics, particularly during drought, will improve the precision of the bioenergetics models in the Central Valley; TRUEMET (Central Valley Joint Venture 2006) and SWAMP (Miller et al. 2014). But knowing where food resources are may not be completely sufficient if bird behavior influences bird distribution and make food resources differentially \u201cavailable\u201d. Decision processes made by individual waterfowl may also have synergistic effects with particular habitat dynamic patterns (e.g., spatial density dependence). We propose a two phase project to better understand the impact of drought on waterbirds and increase the utility of dynamic habitat mapping projects by integrating with concurrently collected near real-time waterfowl movement data to inform parameter space in landscape (TRUEMET) and agent-based (SWAMP) bioenergetics models. In Phase I, we will (1) conduct model analysis to identify how drought influences available wetland habitat types and the duration and extent of flooding, (2) evaluate changes in waterbird food energy supplies using TRUEMET with parameters derived from the classified wetland data developed above to assess impact of changing wetland availability as the result of drought on meeting waterfowl and shorebird conservation objectives, and (3) implement the tested classification algorithms to calculate wetland and energy availability at different scales from automated classifications of Landsat 8 satellite data as an ongoing assessment of drought, water management decisions, and subsequent impacts on wetlands and waterbird habitat. In Phase II, we will use kernel and change\u2010point utilization distributions (CPUDs [Overton 2014]) heuristic and statistical (e.g, logistic regression) analysis methods to link bird movement data combined with habitat data to develop the necessary movement metrics that will inform agent-based (SWAMP) and landscape (TRUEMET) bioenergetics models to assess impacts of drought conditions. Decision on optimal allocation and management of water resources must consider multiple wildlife objectives, including but not limited to habitat objectives for waterfowl, shorebirds, and other waterbirds. Additional information on responsiveness of waterfowl and shorebirds to water allocation and management decisions will help evaluate the effectiveness of water management practices intended to provide adequate wetland habitat for waterbirds.\r\n\r\nProducts developed as part of this work will include Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data layers for the entire Central Valley for April through 2000 \u2013 2011; classification heuristic for delineating wetland types (irrigated seasonal, non-irrigated, semi-permanent) based on inundation frequency and NDVI indices to represent irrigation; model and analysis quantifying the effect of drought on wetland composition, as well as water inundation frequency and duration in the Central Valley; evaluation of the effect of drought on food availability for waterfowl and shorebirds by integrating modeled wetland type, water abundance and irrigation information with the TRUMET bioenergetics model; application of the classification heuristic to track wetland type and extent over time using Landsat 8 data; integration of Landsat 8 wetland tracking with movement data on ducks marked with satellite transmitters to develop parameters for SWAMP model . Information developed as part of this project will be made available via a webpage.

During extreme drought conditions, the ability to provide sufficient water for wildlife often depends on the timing of water deliveries and decisions whether to fallow croplands. Waterfowl and shorebirds may be particularly affected by these decisions since they typically rest and feed in flooded habitats. Poor habitats resulting from improper water deliveries could reduce waterfowl hunting opportunities and body condition. Point Blue will develop near real-time tracking of waterbird habitats and the USGS will connect this with near real-time tracking of waterfowl throughout the valley to learn which habitats the birds use and why.

Recent studies have shown that more than 60% of heavy cool season precipitation events (Nov-Mar) in the Verde River basin in northeastern Arizona, are related to the occurrence of Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) (Rivera, 2014). ARs are narrow corridors of concentrated water vapor that bring copious amount of rainfall along the U.S. west coast (Dettinger et al., 2011; Neiman et al., 2008; Ralph et al., 2013; Ralph and Dettinger, 2012; Ralph et al., 2006; Rutz et al., 2014) and penetrate inland where they interact with the topography to produce heavy precipitation and flooding (Neiman et al., 2013; Rivera, 2014). Additionally, the arrival of ARs can contribute to the end of persistent droughts in the west coast (Dettinger, 2013). The Salt and Verde basins provide most of the water supply for the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, the 12th largest in the USA, and for two tribal reservations: the White Mountain Apache tribe and the San Carlos Apache tribe which jointly own 59.4% of the land. While current drier-than-normal atmospheric conditions have increased forest fire risk and have put more pressure on the available water for human and ecosystem consumption; near and mid-term (months to decades) precipitation projections are of great concern to natural-resource managers who depend on the basins\u2019 resources for water supply, ecosystem health, and economic activities such as timber, carbon credit projects, wildlife and recreational enterprises. Intense precipitation events can cause flooding which results in turbid water that is untreatable and damages the recharge facilities, this creates difficulties for water managers in the region (Doug Toy, pers. comm.).\r\n \r\nThe objectives of the proposed research, responding to Science Priorities 1 and 2, are: 1) Analyze the predictability of ARs at intermediate timescales (10 years) using decadal climate model simulations by identifying the large scale-atmospheric circulation patterns associated to ARs. Are ARs modulated by ENSO events? Are ARs likely to become more frequent and intense under warmer climates? 2) Develop and apply hydrological models to simulate streamflows in the basins for water management (e.g., reservoir levels and releases) and for flood control purposes. How is the frequency and intensity of ARs linked to drought periods in the basin? \r\n\r\nWe plan to use an automated AR detection algorithm (Rivera and Dominguez, in preparation) to identify ARs affecting the Salt-Verde basin in the decadal climate simulations from the CMIP5 experiment. These simulations are initialized with observed sea surface temperatures every 5 years (1960, 1965,\u2026,2005) and run 10 years into the future and could potentially yield a better representation of ocean-atmosphere procesess (Meehl et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2012). We will evaluate the predictability of ARs based on changes in the location of Pacific jet stream linked to ENSO events which results in wetter than normal winters (Canon et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2006). It is important to keep in mind that the intensity and spatial extent of precipitation linked to ARs is due to the interaction of the atmospheric moisture with the local topography, however, the CMIP5 GCMs are still too coarse to realistically represent these fine-scale processes. We will obtain a detailed representation of the projected precipitation in the basin, by dynamically downscaling individual AR events using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Regional Climate Model for both the historical and projected future climates.\r\nWhile understanding the precipitation response to AR events is important, this information is not particularly useful to stakeholders who are primarily concerned with the impact of precipitation events on runoff in the reservoirs. Consequently, most of our efforts will be focused on analyzing the hydrologic response of the Salt and Verde basins to AR events. We will use both observed and simulated historical and future precipitation to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. The model will provide information on streamflow in the Salt and Verde, as well as soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and other hydrologic variables through the basin. We will simulate event-driven daily streamflows along the main channels placing particular attention to the role of antecedent moisture conditions in the basin on flooding. Since extreme wet events cause flooding that results in untreatable turbid waters, we will analyze how often water quality issues are associated to an AR occurrence. Flooding along the main channels will also be simulated with the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System model (HEC-RAS) for maximum daily simulated flows.

Land managers, as they work to develop robust climate change adaptation strategies, are keen to buy time by enhancing forest resistance (sensu Walker et al. 2004) to such abrupt, severe, and widespread changes. Reductions in tree density following thinning (from mechanical treatments, prescribed fire, or both) have been widely presumed to increase resistance to drought. Yet this proposition has remained largely untested, meaning land managers do not have the basic information they need for critical cost-benefit analyses. \r\nProcedures/Methods: Capitalizing on existing long-term forest monitoring datasets, detailed physiological measurements, experimental plots and a variety of remotely sensed imagery, we will assess stand conditions created by recent forest management with conditions in untreated areas to assess whether and to what extent thinning promotes resistance to the current severe drought. Specifically, we will relate field-based forest metrics including demographic structure, abundance, size and species of trees, level of dieback, and potentially physiological measurements to remotely sensed indices of drought, including aerial mapping of forest dieback, MODIS NDII, Landsat time series, and hyperspectral data. We will use GIS to integrate the various data types through a stratification of the landscape that identifies what forest applications have been done where, and what remote sensing datasets are available at which locations. The results from such a framework can also be used to make predictive estimates of future forest conditions by leveraging rasterized projections of future landscape hydrological conditions, which can be assessed for the future times at which the San Joaquin will experience droughts similar to the current one.\r\nExpected Products and Information/Technology Transfer: We will engage managers at all phases of project development and execution. Currently we have enlisted the support of key land managers in the region, and received commitments for data sharing and assistance with project scoping and technology translation. \r\nPersonnel/Cooperators/Partners: Our research team has extensive publication records in top journals in the fields of climate change impacts, fire science, forest ecology and remote sensing. Much of our work has focused on understanding climate change impacts on forest ecosystems and possible management responses. \r\n"}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}], "files": [{"checksum": {"type": "MD5", "value": "cc2186eeb34cd62199cdd1117ff26f42"}, "contentEncoding": null, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "dateUploaded": "2016-10-31T18:54:11Z", "downloadUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8?f=__disk__4b%2F83%2F74%2F4b8374419a0451d1239b2fe654a406c295be032d", "imageHeight": 1534, "imageWidth": 2046, "name": "Fire_SierraNationalForest_CA_USFS.jpg", "originalMetadata": false, "pathOnDisk": "__disk__4b/83/74/4b8374419a0451d1239b2fe654a406c295be032d", "previewImage": {"large": {"height": 750, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8?f=__disk__4b%2F83%2F74%2F4b8374419a0451d1239b2fe654a406c295be032d&width=1000&height=750", "width": 1000}, "medium": {"height": 435, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8?f=__disk__4b%2F83%2F74%2F4b8374419a0451d1239b2fe654a406c295be032d&width=580&height=435", "width": 580}, "small": {"height": 262, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8?f=__disk__4b%2F83%2F74%2F4b8374419a0451d1239b2fe654a406c295be032d&width=350&height=262", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 112, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/561ff941e4b03ee62faa90f8?f=__disk__4b%2F83%2F74%2F4b8374419a0451d1239b2fe654a406c295be032d&width=150&height=112", "width": 150}}, "processToken": null, "processed": false, "s3Object": null, "size": 395068, "title": "Fire in the Sierra National Forest, CA -

Native Americans have a deep connection to the natural environment within which their livelihoods, cultural identity, and spiritual practices are rooted.

In the Southwest, tribes are already experiencing a range of impacts that are at least partially related to climate change. They include serious water quality and supply issues in the context of prolonged drought; reduced ability to grow or collect important traditional crops and raw materials; loss of forest resources from large and landscape-transforming wildfires exacerbated by drought, aridity, and insect infestations; and health impacts from heat waves, dust storms, and smoke from wildfires.<br>\n<br>\nThe Southwest Climate Science Center is partnering with the University of Arizona Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions (CCASS) to leverage previously existing and newly developing tribal engagement capacity within CCASS and to help identify emergent opportunities to support tribes in adapting to climate change.

Native Americans have a deep connection to the natural environment within which their livelihoods, cultural identity, and spiritual practices are rooted. Changes to hydrologic regimes, landscapes, and ecosystems, in combination with socio-economic and political factors, amplify tribal vulnerabilities to climate change. In the Southwest, tribes are already experiencing a range of impacts that are at least partially related to climate change. They include serious water supply and water quality issues in the context of prolonged drought; loss of ecosystem services and reduced ability to grow or collect important traditional crops and raw materials; increased impacts to forest resources from large and landscape-transforming wildfires due to drought, aridity, and insect infestations; health impacts from heat waves, dust storms, and smoke from wildfires; and the potential spread of infectious diseases from geographic shifts in disease vectors. The remoteness of many villages also compounds difficulties in aiding tribal members during extreme weather events such as floods and heat waves, leading to over-stressed emergency management systems. The aim of this project is to help develop a partnership that leverages previously existing and newly developing tribal engagement capacity within the Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions (CCASS) and identifies emergent opportunities now possible with enhanced investment. Ultimately, a SW CSC-LCC-CCASS partnership will support achieving a suite of shared objectives in the near and longer-term. CCASS will expand the current work of the SW CSC and build on prior investments of the University of Arizona-based and NOAA-funded Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS), while building the programs and services of the CCASS/Haury Native Nations Climate Adaptation Program.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=561fa7b9e4b03ee62faa9010"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -102.041481667, "maxY": 42.009518333, "minX": -124.409590667, "minY": 31.332172667}, "representationalPoint": [-113.225536167, 36.6708455], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Tribal Adaptation Initiative & Support for Enhanced Scenario Planning Outcomes", "summary": "Native Nations face unique challenges related to climate change.

Methods and locations will vary with the sub-studies, but will involve tree-ring techniques, forest ecological plot methods, thermal monitoring with thermochrons, mammal behavioral studies, and GLORIA vegetation monitoring protocols.

In the western U.S., severe drought and rising temperatures have caused increased tree mortality and complete forest diebacks. Forests are changing rapidly, and while land managers are working to develop long-term climate change adaptation plans, they require tools that can enhance forest resistance to drought now.

It is also thought that this act of selectively removing some trees helps the remaining trees better survive drought events, because there is less competition for water. However, the proposition that prescribed burning could improve forest resistance to drought has never been formally tested. By comparing the survivorship of trees in burned and unburned forest monitoring plots in drought-impacted areas, researchers will determine (a) whether prescribed fire is an effective tool for improving forest resistance to drought, and (b) whether factors such as time since fire and tree species and size influence a forest\u2019s degree of resistance.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nIn the face of ongoing climate change and projected future drought conditions in the West, this study will help land managers make informed decisions on how to best allocate limited climate change adaptation funds.

Land managers, as they work to develop robust climate change adaptation strategies, are keen to buy time by enhancing forest resistance (sensu Walker et al. 2004) to such abrupt, severe, and widespread changes. Reductions in tree density following prescribed fire have been widely presumed to increase resistance to drought. Yet this proposition has remained untested until now, meaning land managers do not have the basic information they need for critical cost-benefit analyses. \r\nProcedures/Methods: We will examine the primary measure of forest resistance, tree survivorship, across hundreds of existing burned and unburned forest monitoring plots in which the fates of individual trees of all species and sizes have been tracked for decades. We will compare proportions of trees surviving the drought in the burned vs. unburned plots, quantifying the effects of time since fire and differences among species and size classes. We have already leveraged USGS and NPS funds to re-read many of these plots \u2013 mostly in California; we will seek SWCSC funds to re-read other plots in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.\r\nExpected Products and Information/Technology Transfer: We will use LCC communication pathways (e.g., webinars) and on-site visits to communicate our findings to managers and the public.

Prescribed fire reduces fire risk partly by removing small trees, shrubs, and surface litter; it is also assumed that following fire there is less competition among remaining trees so that they are more resistant (more likely to survive) in the face of additional stressors, such as drought. Yet this proposition remains untested, so that managers do not have the basic information they need for to evaluate whether prescribed fire actually achieves this objective. In the face of ongoing climatic changes, is a dollar best spent on increasing forest resistance using prescribed fire, or is it best spent on other climate change adaptation needs? The severe and on-going drought across much of the southwestern United States provides a remarkable natural experiment to test whether prescribed fire helps trees survive stressful conditions. If current practices for modifying forest conditions through fire are found to increase drought resistance, our project could help forest managers apply these methods across western forests more broadly. The results of this study may change management policy to maximize resource benefit from fire. Our specific questions are as follows. (1) Does prescribed fire actually increase forest resistance to drought, and if so, by how much? (2) If so, does the strength of that resistance depend on time since fire? For example, is drought resistance initially low following a burn, but increasing in subsequent years and decades? (3) Do the benefits of prescribed fire, with regard to resistance, vary among tree species and size classes? In particular, is the resistance of large trees - which sequester the most carbon and are critical to wildlife - enhanced by prescribed burns? Results will help land managers make informed decisions on how to allocate their limited climate-change adaptation funds.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=552bcafbe4b026915857df7e"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -103.001964333, "maxY": 42.009518333, "minX": -124.409590667, "minY": 31.332172667}, "representationalPoint": [-113.70577750000001, 36.6708455], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Fighting Drought with Fire: Can Managers Increase Forest Resistance to Drought using Prescribed Fire?", "summary": "Drought is one of the biggest threats facing our forests today. In the western U.S., severe drought and rising temperatures have caused increased tree mortality and complete forest diebacks. Forests are changing rapidly, and while land managers are working to develop long-term climate change adaptation plans, they require tools that can enhance forest resistance to drought now. To address this immediate need, researchers are examining whether a common forest management tool, prescribed fire, can be implemented to help forests better survive drought.

Coastal habitats also provide protective ecosystem services to human communities, which are increasingly at risk to storms and sea level rise under future climate change. Understanding how climate change will impact natural and human communities is a crucial part of decision making and management related to the protection of our coasts.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nIn a collaborative project between the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NA LCC) and the Northeast Climate Science Center, researchers compiled existing&nbsp;<a href=\"http://northatlanticlcc.org/products/thresholds-for-coastal-species-and-habitats\">threshold information on priority coastal fish, wildlife, and plant species</a>&nbsp;as well as coastal habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and Caribbean in response to sea level rise and storm projections. As the effects of climate change on ecological and human communities grow, the possibility of crossing tipping points or thresholds of viability increases the potential for rapid and possibly irreversible changes in ecosystems. Therefore, understanding thresholds related to climate change is critical for facilitating conservation and management actions, which could help to prevent more costly and possibly catastrophic effects in the near (years to decades) and distant (decades to centuries) future. The compilation of this information will help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how natural systems will respond to climate change and how land and resource management decisions could potentially help these species. &nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nResearchers further compiled natural and nature-based approaches to restoration and management that benefit both natural and human communities in the coastal zone, as well as synthesized information on the suite of ecosystem services provided by tidal marshes, beaches and barrier islands, mangroves, and shellfish beds. This work will inform climate change adaptation and resilience planning and assist coastal communities that must weigh important tradeoffs regarding the benefits and drawbacks of green and grey coastal infrastructure.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nResults from these synthesis activities have been presented in several formats, including easily accessible topic-specific web pages in the online&nbsp;<a href=\"http://necsc.umass.edu/projects/massachusetts-fish-and-wildlife-climate-action-tool\">Massachusetts Wildlife Climate Action Tool</a>.</div>\n", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"active": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "mstaudinger@usgs.gov", "firstName": "Michelle", "jobTitle": "Post Doc", "lastName": "Staudinger", "middleName": "D", "name": "Michelle D Staudinger", "oldPartyId": 58319, "organization": {"displayText": "Northeast Climate Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"building": "Morrill Science Center", "buildingCode": "AGY", "faxPhone": "4135452202", "mailAddress": {"city": "Reston", "country": "USA", "line1": "12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, Mail Stop 400", "mailStopCode": "400", "state": "VA", "zip": "20192-0002"}, "name": "Michelle D Staudinger/BRD/ASSOCIATES/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "officePhone": "4135771318", "streetAddress": {"city": "Amherst", "line1": "134 Morrill Science Center (611 N.

For each one, aerial imagery will be\r\nused to evaluate the degree of upstream ponding and likely sediment retention, and land cover\r\ndata will be distilled to quantitatively summarize land use patterns in each watershed (agriculture\r\nvs. urban vs.forest vs. wetland). At a subset of dams, field sampling will confirm inferences\r\nfrom GIS databases, and enable empirical comparisons of nutrient concentrations upstream vs.\r\ndownstream of the dam.\r\nIn the second year, we will work with Dr. Peter Esselman from USGS' Great Lakes Science\r\nCenter and Dr. Dale Robertson from USGS' Wisconsin Water Center to estimate annual nutrient\r\nloads to Lake Michigan from each watershed, and the potential role that dams could play in both\r\nslowing the flow of water to Lake Michigan and reducing loads of nitrogen (via denitrification)\r\nand phosphorus (via sediment retention).\r\nThis will involve modeling the relationship between land use and nutrient yield for the region,\r\nand then adapting these generalized models to the watersheds of Wisconsin. This collaborative\r\neffort will build on Esselman's earlier work on statistical relationships between land use and\r\nnutrient yields in the Great Lakes, and Robertson's adaptation of SPARROW models to Great\r\nLakes watersheds. This work will yield an integrative set of models predicting which dams are\r\nmost likely to mediate nutrient loads to Lake Michigan.\r\nIn the third year, we will reconcile inferences about nutrient load mediation with McIntyre's dam\r\nremoval prioritization framework for fish passage. These two major management goals are\r\ngenerally considered in isolation. Our work will directly compare the two, and use a joint\r\nprioritization approach to identify individual dams where tradeoffs between restoring fish\r\npassage and increasing nutrient loads would be minimized. These results will be conveyed to the\r\nstakeholder community through workshops and meetings, to ensure that this dualistic\r\nunderstanding is incorporated into restoration prioritization and on-the-ground efforts of agencies\r\nand NGOs throughout the Great Lakes region.

This information will allow for more accurate assessments of the vulnerability of wildlife species and will help in adaptation planning efforts.&nbsp;</div>\n", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"contactType": "person", "email": "cgriffin@eco.umass.edu", "highlighted": true, "name": "Curt Griffin", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "null", "country": "null", "line1": "null", "state": "null", "zip": "null"}, "officePhone": "null", "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Principal Investigator"}, {"contactType": "organization", "name": "Northeast CSC", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Funding Agency"}, {"contactType": "person", "name": "Bill DeLuca", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Cooperator/Partner"}, {"contactType": "person", "name": "Radley Horton", "organization": {"displayText": "Columbia University"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Cooperator/Partner"}, {"active": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "morelli@umass.edu", "firstName": "Toni Lyn", "lastName": "Morelli", "name": "Toni Lyn Morelli", "oldPartyId": 66382, "organization": {"displayText": "Northeast Climate Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Cooperator/Partner"}, {"contactType": "person", "name": "Alexej Siren", "organization": {"displayText": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Cooperator/Partner"}, {"active": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "frthompson@fs.fed.us", "firstName": "Frank", "lastName": "Thompson", "name": "Frank  Thompson", "oldPartyId": 64840, "organization": {"directoryId": "64574", "displayText": "University of Missouri"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Cooperator/Partner"}], "dates": [{"dateString": "2016-09-01", "label": "Start Date", "type": "Start"}, {"dateString": "2019-08-31", "label": "End Date", "type": "End"}], "distributionLinks": [{"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "KML Service", "type": "kml", "typeLabel": "KML Download", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/57b35c6de4b03bcb01039665?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase WMS Service", "type": "serviceCapabilitiesUrl", "typeLabel": "OGC Service Capabilities URL", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/57b35c6de4b03bcb01039665?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection JSON", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=57b35c6de4b03bcb01039665&format=json"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection ATOM", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=57b35c6de4b03bcb01039665&format=atom"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection CSV", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=57b35c6de4b03bcb01039665&format=csv"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase OAI PMH Service", "type": "oai-pmh", "typeLabel": "OAI-PMH", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=57b35c6de4b03bcb01039665"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase CSW Service", "type": "csw", "typeLabel": "", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57b35c6de4b03bcb01039665/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords"}, {"files": [{"contentType": "image/jpeg", "name": "MtMansfield_VT_AlanCressler.jpg", "size": 196464, "title": "Mount Mansfield, Vermont - Credit: Alan Cressler"}], "name": "ExaminingtheRes.zip", "rel": "alternate", "title": "Download Attached Files", "type": "downloadLink", "typeLabel": "Download Link", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/57b35c6de4b03bcb01039665"}], "extents": [3097032], "facets": [{"className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet", "facetName": "Project", "parts": [{"type": "Technical Summary", "value": "Climate change-driven shifts in distribution and abundance have been\r\ndocumented in many species.

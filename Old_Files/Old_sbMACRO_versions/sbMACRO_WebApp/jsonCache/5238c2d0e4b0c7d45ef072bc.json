Elders and wisdomkeepers from tribes of the Point No Point Treaty Council have expressed deep concerns about the potential effects of climate change on plant species of key cultural significance, particularly those located in tribal gathering areas on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis project was a direct response to tribal concerns about the loss of culturally significant plants from tribal gathering areas. Researchers conducted interviews with elders from the Port Gamble S\u2019Klallam Tribe to identify eight plants of key cultural concern because of their growing scarcity, including wild berries, yew, Western redcedar, yarrow, and cattail. Researchers then documented the historical and current distribution and abundance of the eight key plants and used climate models to predict future changes for these species. This research provides baseline information that can be used by tribal and non-tribal resource managers to continue documenting changes and to develop management options for addressing shifting ranges and abundance of culturally significant plant species.</p>\n</div>\n", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"contactType": "person", "email": "Jesse.Ford@oregonstate.edu", "firstName": "Jesse", "lastName": "Ford", "name": "Jesse Ford", "organization": {"directoryId": "23458", "displayText": "Oregon State University"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {"city": "Corvallis", "country": "USA", "line1": "Dept.

A formal Memorandum of Understanding was developed between Oregon State University and the PGST to guide this culturally sensitive research. We recommend this formal approach to researchers considering tribal partnerships in order to ensure expectations of all parties are clearly outlined. During formal interviews and informal conversation, PGST elders mentioned 37 plants, of which eight terrestrial species and a group of marine taxa were of particular concern due to limited availabilities in 26 traditional gathering locations within the Usual and Accustomed (U&A) gathering area, guaranteed by the 1855 Point No Point Treaty. Landsat data were used to analyze recent changes in land cover within the U&A. Substantial changes in land cover were found between 1975 and 2010. Detailed analysis for 1990-2010 documented recent forest fragmentation, loss of freshwater wetlands, and both losses and gains of saltwater wetlands. Current regional distribution and autecological information for the eight focal terrestrial species were compiled using available databases, herbarium records, and literature. Field studies documented plant communities in which selected focal species are currently found.\n\nDownscaled results from existing Pacific Northwest climate scenarios were adapted to the Olympic and Kitsap Peninsula, which house the U&A. These suggest somewhat hotter, drier summers and somewhat warmer, wetter conditions in other seasons by the late 21st century. Changes in seasonal precipitation were less clear, with uncertainty regarding the magnitude and even direction of change. Published information related to climate variables for the eight focal species was sparse, making even semi-quantitative projections of response to changing climates impossible. In addition, we created map of the U&A shoreline representing expected changes in shoreline due to changing climates combined with tectonic events.

The intimate connections that tribes have maintained with the natural environment are more spiritually rich and complex than non-Native consumptive views of natural resources. After careful consideration of tribe size, level of cultural activity, strength of ties to the environment, and connection to culturally significant and aboriginal geographic regions, three Northwest tribes were selected for this study--the Confederated Tribes of Salish and Kootenai, the Qinault Indian Nation, and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians. Information was collected through interviews with tribal elders and individuals with substantial cultural expertise. We found that in addition to changes in specific cultural practices, a profound disruption to identity connected with (a) changes in seasonality, disturbing the sense of natural time; and (b) a sense that wisdom passed down through generations is no longer a sound basis for which decisions are made. These observations contribute to the understanding of Northwest tribal culture and its vulnerability and adaptive capacity to a changing climate. This research documented traditional cultural commonalities among the tribes involved with this project and illustrated inter-tribal cultural adaptations to their prevailing environmental conditions. The results of this study will also provide tribes a resource to assess climate change impacts on their cultural practices and identity.

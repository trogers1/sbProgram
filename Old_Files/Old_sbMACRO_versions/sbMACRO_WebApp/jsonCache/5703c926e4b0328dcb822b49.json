A comprehensive understanding of how climate change is and will impact inland fishes worldwide is key to sustainable management of this ecologically and economically important natural resource. Synthesis of projected and documented impacts of climate change on inland fishes globally can be useful to inform future research and management efforts. Since the mid-1980s, scientists have projected the effects of climate change on inland fish, and in more recent years, documentation of climate change impacts on fish has increased, albeit the number of documented impacts of climate change on inland fish remains low. We conducted an extensive, systematic literature review to identify both projected and documented examples of climate change impacts on fish globally. We did not include studies that analyzed climate variability; thus, all documented examples showed a change in precipitation, temperature, or other climate variable that was be attributed to climate change by the authors. We then categorized the documented studies into 6 groups based on the type of response variable studied (i.e., demographic, phenological, distributional, etc.) and extracted the data to quantitatively analyze trends across species traits and thermal guilds. Dissecting and providing current global trends in fish responses to climate change by ecological and thermal guild will help managers anticipate future changes in fish populations and develop more strategic management plans for individual species and groups.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5759ae83e4b04f417c263f01"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": 179.999999999968, "maxY": 83.6235961786649, "minX": -179.99999999994, "minY": -55.719585418196}, "representationalPoint": [1.3997691894473974e-11, 13.95200538023445], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Global Synthesis of Climate Change Effects on Inland Fish", "summary": "Inland fish populations are a crucial resource to humans and communities around the world.

This has prompted varied research efforts to determine the factors contributing to the reduced local populations. Although heat stress from increasing temperatures could be a potential factor for declining populations in Minnesota, temperature increases have also occurred in New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut where populations have been expanding in recent years. Alternatively, indirect climate effects from warmer temperatures may be playing a role, such as increased prevalence of parasites (e.g., brainworm, winter tick) to levels lethal to moose. Additionally, factors such as predation, differences in habitat, and fitness are being considered. Genomics has the potential to complement ongoing research by providing unique approaches to explore moose responses to stress through the examination of molecular differences in heat tolerance, immune response, or fitness in general. This project is utilizing such genomic techniques to study the responses of moose to environmental stressors throughout the southern periphery of their range in the U.S. Northeast, Midwest (Minnesota and Michigan), and Rocky Mountains. Because populations from those regions represent three subspecies, it is important to first understand population relatedness and any genetic variances through a genome scan. Secondarily, we will investigate actively expressed genes and cellular function, which may provide information on variation in immune responses to local stressors. Ultimately, we will look for genes that may be under selection, which could represent local adaptations to environmental conditions. This information has the potential to provide insights on moose fitness in a changing environment and aims to provide valuable information for managers in regions that are interested in maintaining sustainable populations.</div>\n", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "contacts": [{"active": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "mhunter@usgs.gov", "firstName": "Margaret", "jobTitle": "Research Geneticist", "lastName": "Hunter", "middleName": "E", "name": "Margaret E Hunter", "orcId": "0000-0002-4760-9302", "organization": {"displayText": "Southeast Ecological Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"building": "WARC -

In Hawaii, though rainfall intensity has increased, total rainfall has been on the decline for the last two decades and, as a result, reduced stream flow. Climate models project continuous declines in rainfall with uneven spatial distribution. While studies have assessed the impact of changing climate on the vegetation in Hawaii, little is known on how climate change is affecting stream ecosystems, and little is known on how climate change impacts the downstream estuarine and coastal systems.  Streams are an integral link between terrestrial, fluvial, and marine ecosystems. The changes of dynamic patterns of streamflow could result in the temporal and spatial difference in flow, nutrients, and sediments, and in turn affect the fluvial, estuarine, and coastal habitats. In particular, these habitats support the native aquatic species in Hawaii at different stages of their amphidromous life cycle. We propose to understand flow dynamic patterns through stream flow simulation; assess the impact of changes in climate on nine groups of native aquatic species; use tool to prioritize conservation effort for Hawaii aquatic ecosystems. This research proposal has arises explicitly from discussions with local stakeholder groups (e.g., the Hawaii Fish Habitat Partnership) about science needs for aquatic ecosystems to better manage in current conditions and prepare for projected changes.

Studies suggest that multiple factors \u2013 potentially linked to climate change \u2013 are contributing to the decline of walleye, including changes in lake temperatures, loss of habitat, increasing water clarity (perhaps due to drought), and interactions with other fish. This research seeks to identify the mechanisms that underlie declining walleye populations, particularly the low survival rate of young walleye. Data will be collected through a whole-lake experiment, an analysis of long-term data from lakes in northern Wisconsin, and simulation modeling. Members of the research team will work closely with fisheries managers. The goal of this project is to increase our understanding of the conditions that are needed to maintain self-sustaining walleye populations (their \u201csafe operating space\u201d) and to inform a new vision for recreational fisheries management in a changing climate.</div>\n", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"contactType": "person", "email": "amusch@uwsp.edu", "highlighted": true, "name": "Daniel Isermann", "organization": {"displayText": "WI Cooperative Fishery Research Unit"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "Stevens Point", "country": "USA", "line1": "800 Reserve St", "state": "WI", "zip": "54481"}, "officePhone": "715-346-3221", "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Principal Investigator"}, {"contactType": "organization", "name": "NCCWSC", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Funding Agency"}], "dates": [{"dateString": "2016-05-04", "label": "Start Date", "type": "Start"}, {"dateString": "2023-09-30", "label": "End Date", "type": "End"}], "distributionLinks": [{"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "KML Service", "type": "kml", "typeLabel": "KML Download", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/573f4df1e4b04a3a6a24ae6b?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase WMS Service", "type": "serviceCapabilitiesUrl", "typeLabel": "OGC Service Capabilities URL", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/573f4df1e4b04a3a6a24ae6b?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection JSON", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=573f4df1e4b04a3a6a24ae6b&format=json"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection ATOM", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=573f4df1e4b04a3a6a24ae6b&format=atom"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection CSV", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=573f4df1e4b04a3a6a24ae6b&format=csv"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase OAI PMH Service", "type": "oai-pmh", "typeLabel": "OAI-PMH", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=573f4df1e4b04a3a6a24ae6b"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase CSW Service", "type": "csw", "typeLabel": "", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/573f4df1e4b04a3a6a24ae6b/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords"}, {"files": [{"contentType": "image/jpeg", "name": "Walleye_EricEngbretson_FWS.jpg", "size": 804833, "title": "Walleye - Credit: Eric Engbretson, FWS"}, {"contentType": "image/jpeg", "name": "Walleye_GretchenHansen1.jpg", "size": 1209503, "title": "Walleye - Credit: Gretchen Hansen"}, {"contentType": "image/jpeg", "name": "Walleye_GretchenHansen2.jpg", "size": 1328673, "title": "Walleye - Credit: Gretchen Hansen"}], "name": "SafeOperatingSp.zip", "rel": "alternate", "title": "Download Attached Files", "type": "downloadLink", "typeLabel": "Download Link", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/573f4df1e4b04a3a6a24ae6b"}], "extents": [20], "facets": [{"className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet", "facetName": "Project", "parts": [{"type": "Technical Summary", "value": "Global change, including large scale changes in climate, land use, hydrology, and biogeochemistry, creates unprecedented pressure on inland recreational fisheries. Local fish managers have little influence on these large-scale changes, but they can manipulate factors such as harvest, food web structure, and some features of habitat. The Safe Operating Space (SOS) concept establishes a framework for analyzing a fishery in the context of both large-scale and local factors. Adaptation is the manipulation of local factors (such as harvest, food web structure, or habitat) to maintain the SOS of a fishery as the climate changes. At the scale of many lakes on a landscape, the SOS can be used to identify lakes that are inside, outside, or on the edge of the SOS. Appropriate management may differ among these three categories of lakes. A lake that lies on the edge of the SOS may be restored by management that moves it into the SOS. This project will develop the SOS concept using the Walleye fisheries of Northern Wisconsin as a test case. The research will use comparative studies, a whole-lake experiment, models, and synthesis of extant long-term data to quantify the Walleye SOS over a diverse landscape with thousands of lakes. We will develop tools for classifying lakes with respect to the Walleye SOS. For lakes on the edge of the SOS, we will use simulation models to explore options for tipping such lakes into the SOS. We will conduct a whole-lake experiment to test the feasibility of restoring the Walleye SOS by removal of centrarchids. Findings will be shared with the public, managers, and the scientific community through diverse media, publications, workshops and presentations.

The ability of species to adapt to the impacts of climate change (i.e., their adaptive capacity) is an important factor to consider when assessing vulnerability. For example, organisms can possess traits that allow them to move to areas of favorable habitat or change their phenotypes (observable characteristics) in response to changing environmental conditions. Additionally, an organism\u2019s traits can adapt to a changing external environment over multiple generations through evolutionary processes.<br>\n<br>\nRecent scientific evidence suggests that \u201cevolutionary adaptive capacity\u201d (the ability to adapt to changing environments via evolutionary processes; EVAC) can actually occur over shorter time periods than originally thought and the tools to measure and predict evolutionary changes are becoming increasingly available. However, accounting for EVAC in climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning is uncommon and resource managers often make decisions without considering the potential evolution of species.<br>\n<br>\nThe purpose of this project is to help bridge the gap between science and management communities by highlighting examples of EVAC that have resulted from changing climate conditions and providing insights on how relevant scientific information can be used in policy and planning activities. This work will foster a two-way communication between scientists and managers that focuses equally on what scientists can learn from managers and what managers can learn from scientists, increasing the likelihood of knowledge and science use by the decision-making community. The specific objectives are to 1) illustrate the importance of EVAC and its interaction with other forms of adaptive capacity for understanding vulnerability of wildlife, 2) identify common barriers that managers encounter with regards to assessing and making decisions related to EVAC, 3) provide knowledge that could serve as a solution for overcoming these barriers, and 4) identify knowledge gaps where future research is needed to inform key management questions.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"active": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "lthompson@usgs.gov", "firstName": "Laura", "jobTitle": "Research Biologist", "lastName": "Thompson", "middleName": "M", "name": "Laura M Thompson", "organization": {"displayText": "National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"building": "John W Powell FB", "buildingCode": "AAA", "faxPhone": "7036484044", "mailAddress": {"city": "Reston", "country": "USA", "line1": "12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, Mail Stop 400", "mailStopCode": "400", "state": "VA", "zip": "20192-0002"}, "name": "Laura M Thompson/BRD/USGS/DOI -

However, the ability of species to moderate the impacts of climate change (i.e., adaptive capacity) is an important factor to consider when assessing vulnerability. Organisms can possess traits that allow them to move to areas of favorable habitat or alter their phenotypes in response to varying environmental conditions. Additionally, traits can adapt over multiple generations through evolutionary processes. Recent evidence suggests that evolutionary adaptive capacity (EVAC) can occur over shorter time periods than originally thought and tools to measure and predict evolutionary changes are becoming increasingly available. However, accounting for EVAC in climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning is uncommon and resource managers often make decisions without considering the potential evolvability of species. The purpose of this work is to help bridge the gap between the science and management communities by highlighting examples of EVAC that have resulted from changing climate conditions and providing insights on how relevant scientific information can be fed into policy and planning activities. This work will foster a two-way communication that provides equal importance to what scientists can learn from managers and what managers can learn from scientists, increasing the likelihood of knowledge uptake by the decision-making community. The specific objectives are to 1) illustrate the importance of EVAC and its interaction with other forms of adaptive capacity for understanding vulnerability of organisms, 2) identify common barriers that managers encounter with regards to assessing and making decisions related to EVAC, 3) provide knowledge that could serve as a solution for overcoming barriers, and 4) identify knowledge gaps where future research is needed to inform key management questions.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5702c2c1e4b0328dcb8178ac"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -66.9693, "maxY": 49.3717, "minX": -124.7328, "minY": 24.9564}, "representationalPoint": [-95.85105, 37.164049999999996], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Climate Change and Evolutionary Adaptive Capacity (EVAC): Bridging the Gap between Science and Management", "summary": "Assessing the vulnerability of wildlife species to a changing climate is critical for understanding what adaptation actions need to be taken to minimize negative impacts.

Effective conservation of migratory birds depends on a clear understanding of how environmental factors affect key demographic rates (e.g., survival and reproduction). This informational need is especially pressing in the context of climate change. Climate change is expected to affect migratory bird habitat and populations in multiple ways, and a mechanistic understanding of how demographic rates are related to climate variables will help land and resource managers to better anticipate and manage these changes.<br>\n<br>\nThe Institute for Bird Populations (IBP) is addressing this question by using data from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program, the longest running continent-wide monitoring program to provide information on migratory bird demographics (recruitment, survival, immigration, and emigration). Data collected through MAPS is used to clarify the factors driving population declines; to determine priority areas to target for conservation and restoration; and to clarify relationships between demographic trends and environmental factors. IBP is also collaborating with researchers from the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center to develop a climate-informed integrated population model by combining MAPS data with additional data sources on climate variables, population trends, and occupancy data. This model will provide a clearer understanding of the factors that impact migratory bird populations and the ways that climate change is likely to affect species survival by clarifying relationships between climate variables and demographic parameters. Ultimately, this research will provide decision makers and the management community with a mechanistic understanding of how climate change may impact migratory bird population levels and ultimately species survival.<br>\n&nbsp;", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "browseTypes": ["Map Service", "OGC WMS Service", "OGC WFS Layer", "OGC WMS Layer"], "contacts": [{"contactType": "organization", "name": "NCCWSC", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Funding Agency"}, {"contactType": "person", "name": "Jim Saracco", "organization": {"displayText": "Institute for Bird Populations"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Principal Investigator"}], "dates": [{"dateString": "2016-09-01", "label": "Start Date", "type": "Start"}, {"dateString": "2018-08-31", "label": "End Date", "type": "End"}], "distributionLinks": [{"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "KML Service", "type": "kml", "typeLabel": "KML Download", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase WMS Service", "type": "serviceCapabilitiesUrl", "typeLabel": "OGC Service Capabilities URL", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection JSON", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8&format=json"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection ATOM", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8&format=atom"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection CSV", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8&format=csv"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase OAI PMH Service", "type": "oai-pmh", "typeLabel": "OAI-PMH", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase CSW Service", "type": "csw", "typeLabel": "", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords"}, {"files": [{"contentType": "image/jpeg", "name": "Waterfowl_CentralValley_CA_BobWick_BLM.jpg", "size": 187685, "title": "Waterfowl in the Central Valley, CA -

This need is especially pressing in the context of climate change: climate change is expected to affect migratory bird habitat and populations in multiple ways, and a mechanistic understanding of how demographic rates are related to climate variables will help managers to better anticipate and manage these changes. The Institute for Bird Populations (IBP) will address these questions by using data from MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship), the longest running continent-wide monitoring program to provide information on migratory bird demographics (recruitment, survival, immigration, and emigration). Data collected through MAPS is used to clarify the factors driving population declines; to determine priority areas to target for conservation and restoration; and to clarify relationships between demographic trends and environmental factors. By combining MAPS data with additional data sources on climate variables, population trends, and occupancy data, researchers at IBP will collaborate with the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center to develop a climate-informed integrated population model. Producing such a model will allow for a clearer understanding of how climate change is likely to affect species survival by clarifying relationships between climate variables and demographic parameters. Ultimately, this research will provide the management community with a mechanistic understanding of how climate change may impact migratory bird population levels and ultimately species survival.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5874fd4be4b0a829a320beb8"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": 179.775939941213, "maxY": 71.3514404291142, "minX": -178.216552734375, "minY": 18.9254779809854}, "representationalPoint": [0.7796936034190054, 45.1384592050498], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Developing a Climate-informed Integrated Population Model for Migratory Birds", "summary": "Migratory birds play a crucial role in many ecosystems (e.g. as pollinators and insect regulators) and are also valued by many bird watchers throughout the country and world.

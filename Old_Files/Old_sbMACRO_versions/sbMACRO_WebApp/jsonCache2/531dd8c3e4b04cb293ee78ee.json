impact of warming temperatures on water resources, more attention is being paid the relationship between runoff and precipitation, or runoff efficiency. Temperature is a key influence on Colorado River runoff efficiency, and warming temperatures are projected to reduce runoff efficiency. Here, we investigate the nature of runoff efficiency in the upper Colorado River (UCRB) basin over the past 400 years, with a specific focus on major droughts and pluvials, and to contextualize the instrumental period. We first verify the feasibility of reconstructing runoff efficiency from tree-ring data. The reconstruction is then used to evaluate variability in runoff efficiency over periods of high and low flow, and its correspondence to a reconstruction of late runoff season UCRB temperature variability. Results indicate that runoff efficiency has played a consistent role in modulating the relationship between precipitation and streamflow over past centuries, and that temperature has likely been the key control. While negative runoff efficiency is most common during dry periods, and positive runoff efficiency during wet years, there are some instances of positive runoff efficiency moderating the impact of precipitation deficits on streamflow. Compared to past centuries, the 20th century has experienced twice as many high flow years with negative runoff efficiency, likely due to warm temperatures. These results suggest warming temperatures will continue to impact runoff efficiency in wet or dry years, and that future flows will be less than anticipated from precipitation due to warming temperatures.", "browseCategories": ["Data"], "citation": "Pederson, G.T, and Woodhouse, C.A., 2017, Multi-century reconstructions of temperature, precipitation, and runoff efficiency for the Upper Colorado River Basin: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/F79885ZT.

Recent research indicates that spring temperatures are becoming an increasingly important driver of post-1980s snowpack declines in the Southern Rockies. This research shows the combined influence of cool-season temperature and precipitation anomalies of the 20th century served to ameliorate or exacerbate decadal-scale drought/pluvial events in a way that presents substantial, and different, water management challenges. Until now, disentangling the relative roles of temperature and precipitation in driving major decadal-scale departures in upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) water resources over past centuries has not been possible due a lack of a cool season temperature proxy. New results from NSF-funded work by the PIs shows it is now possible to obtain a record of winter/spring temperatures in the UCRB using d18O derived from tree-ring cellulose in cool-season, moisture-sensitive trees. Independent precipitation reconstructions are also available. This project will build on these research results to develop a winter/spring temperature record for the UCRB to assess periods of extreme, decadal-scale drought and pluvial events over the past 1000 years). The main goals of the study are as follows: 1) Examine the relative importance of spring temperatures and cool season precipitation on past drought and pluvial periods documented in the existing Colorado River reconstruction. 2) Evaluate how the magnitude of projected cool-season warming in CMIP-5 models compares to reconstructed spring warming during the most notable UCRB droughts.  3) Collaborate with water managers to determine key research questions concerning winter/spring temperatures and Colorado River flow, and the best ways to incorporate this information into planning for a future. This proposal directly addresses the Southwest CSC scientific priority #3 Hydrological effects of climate change in the Southwest; and produces baseline data for priority#2, Linking climatic, hydrological and ecological changes at intermediate timescales.  It also addresses cross-cutting CSC program priorities including climate impacts on natural resources and engagement with decision makers. Though this project is designed for the UCRB, a similar approach could be used to develop temperature reconstructions where water supplies are dependent on snowpack (e.g. Rio Grande, Sacramento River).\r\n"}, {"type": "FY 14 Grant ($118,024)", "value": "G14AP00152"}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}, {"annualBudgets": [{"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds": 118024.0, "year": "2014"}, {"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds": 49750.0, "year": "2015"}], "className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet", "facetName": "Budget", "parts": [], "totalFunds": 167774.0}], "files": [{"checksum": null, "contentEncoding": null, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "dateUploaded": "2016-03-14T13:56:03Z", "downloadUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/52afcd05e4b0978c01d10420?f=__disk__8f%2Fdc%2F89%2F8fdc897f2d247eb2681700b4e9af3c0ccde387ec", "imageHeight": 415, "imageWidth": 536, "name": "Colorado_River_at_Navajo_Bridge_nr_Lees_Ferry__AZ_06-27-2009_3-USGS.jpg", "originalMetadata": false, "pathOnDisk": "__disk__8f/dc/89/8fdc897f2d247eb2681700b4e9af3c0ccde387ec", "previewImage": {"small": {"height": 271, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/52afcd05e4b0978c01d10420?f=__disk__8f%2Fdc%2F89%2F8fdc897f2d247eb2681700b4e9af3c0ccde387ec&width=350&height=271", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 116, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/52afcd05e4b0978c01d10420?f=__disk__8f%2Fdc%2F89%2F8fdc897f2d247eb2681700b4e9af3c0ccde387ec&width=150&height=116", "width": 150}}, "processToken": null, "processed": false, "s3Object": null, "size": 173802, "title": "Colorado River in Marble Canyon.

Research indicates that spring temperatures are increasingly contributing to low flows, along with dry winters, as temperatures have warmed over the past few decades. While winter precipitation (rain and snow) is very important to the water supplies that result from melting snow, we now know that temperatures in spring can also have an important impact on river flow and water supplies. Our records of river flow, temperatures, and winter precipitation are only about 100 years in length - too short to assess the range of temperature and moisture conditions that can impact river flow - so we turn to tree rings which can be used to reconstruct past climate conditions. Reconstructions of past climate allow us to assess the range of climate events, such as drought, that have occurred in the past, and that could occur in the future. These extended records also enable us to compare recent climate and projections of future climate in the context of the past to determine when conditions exceed the range of natural climate variability. In this study, we will use existing Colorado River streamflow and winter precipitation reconstructions for the past 1000 years, along with a new spring temperature record, developed under this study, to evaluate past droughts, many of which have far exceed the length and severity of droughts recorded in the gage record. These long records allow us to investigate the different combinations of temperatures and winter precipitation that have contributed to past droughts. Were major droughts just devastatingly dry or did warmer spring temperatures play a role? How do warm conditions that influenced past drought compare to the warming that is projected in the future? We will collaborate with water managers to help them determine how warming temperatures may influence river flow in the future.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=52afcd05e4b0978c01d10420"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -105.6283, "maxY": 43.4501, "minX": -112.3263, "minY": 35.5579}, "representationalPoint": [-108.9773, 39.504], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "Disentangling the Influence of Cool Season Temperature and Precipitation on Colorado River Water Resources Using Paleo Data", "summary": "Streamflow in the Colorado River is heavily influenced by high-elevation snowpack.

The results provide detailed information that can be used by California\u2019s coastal land managers to understand the vulnerability of specific sites to changing conditions, enabling decision-makers to effectively implement adaptive management strategies that will sustain the critical function of coastal habitats.<br>\n&nbsp;", "browseCategories": ["Project"], "contacts": [{"contactType": "person", "email": "macdonal@geog.ucla.edu", "name": "Glen MacDonald", "organization": {"displayText": "UCLA"}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {"city": "Los Angeles", "country": "USA", "line1": "UCLA 405 Hilgard Ave.", "state": "CA", "zip": "90095"}, "officePhone": "310-825-5008", "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Principal Investigator"}, {"contactType": "organization", "name": "Southwest CSC", "organization": {}, "primaryLocation": {"mailAddress": {}, "streetAddress": {}}, "type": "Funding Agency"}, {"active": true, "contactType": "person", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "firstName": "Karen", "jobTitle": "Ecologist (Landscape)", "lastName": "Thorne", "middleName": "M", "name": "Karen M Thorne", "oldPartyId": 13502, "organization": {"displayText": "Western Ecological Research Center"}, "primaryLocation": {"building": "SF BAY FLD STATION IN KIND - BLDG 505 MAIN OFC TRLR", "buildingCode": "WBW", "faxPhone": "7075622005", "mailAddress": {"city": "Sacramento", "country": "USA", "line1": "Modoc Hall, USGS, 3020 State University Drive East", "state": "CA", "zip": "95819"}, "name": "Karen M Thorne/BRD/USGS/DOI - Primary Location", "officePhone": "7075623003", "streetAddress": {"city": "Vallejo", "country": "US", "line1": "505 Azuar Drive", "state": "CA", "zip": "94592"}}, "type": "Co-Investigator"}], "dates": [{"dateString": "2014-09-01", "label": "Start Date", "type": "Start"}, {"dateString": "2017-08-31", "label": "End Date", "type": "End"}], "distributionLinks": [{"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection JSON", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452&format=json"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection ATOM", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452&format=atom"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase Collection CSV", "type": "repo", "typeLabel": "ScienceBase Repository", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452&format=csv"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase OAI PMH Service", "type": "oai-pmh", "typeLabel": "OAI-PMH", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452"}, {"files": "", "name": "", "rel": "alternate", "title": "ScienceBase CSW Service", "type": "csw", "typeLabel": "", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords"}, {"files": [{"contentType": "image/jpeg", "name": "CoastalZone_CA_MikeLinksvayer_MPD.jpg", "size": 1312230, "title": "Coastal zone in California (Public domain)"}], "name": "EffectsofSea_Le.zip", "rel": "alternate", "title": "Download Attached Files", "type": "downloadLink", "typeLabel": "Download Link", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452"}], "facets": [{"className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ProjectFacet", "facetName": "Project", "parts": [{"type": "Technical Summary", "value": "Over the past two years, the U. S. Geological Survey, University of California at Los Angeles, and Oregon State University have developed a multidisciplinary team with support from the Southwest CSC to develop a program entitled \u201cCoastal Ecosystem Response to Climate Change (CERCC).\u201d  The focus of CERCC is to engage natural resource managers at coastal sites and provide them with the scientific foundation for developing \u201cbottom-up\u201d climate change understanding and adaptation at local and regional scales.  Our initial work developed baseline datasets (1-cm-accuracy digital elevation models, tidal range loggers, coordinated plant surveys, and sediment studies) for a network of 18 sites along a latitudinal gradient along the Pacific coast in the continental U. S.  The project was developed in consultation with the California and North Pacific LCCs, and recently, both LCCs included us in their initiatives and provided funding to undertake climate \u201croadshows\u201d to conduct local coastal workshops and increase outreach efforts with local partners.  In this Statement of Intent, we propose to continue baseline studies across a coastal site network and integrate process-based, experimental studies at selected sites.\r\n\r\nChanging ocean and atmospheric conditions leading to sea-level rise and increased extreme storm events are reshaping nearshore coastal ecosystems and their local food webs.  The sustainability of mud flats and tidal marshes relies on allochthonous suspended sediment availability from the nearshore and runoff from snowmelt and precipitation as well as autochthonous organic matter production from plants.  Efforts to anticipate coastal ecosystem change have largely relied on global or regional scale data which may not be representative of local sites.  In taking a local site network approach (www.werc.usgs.gov/SFBaySLR), we integrate data from multiple disciplines into empirical models describing current and future conditions and projected response of nearshore habitats.  In addition, our network allows us to capture habitat responses to storm events such as atmospheric rivers that affect the California coast.  We propose to leverage ongoing efforts including downscaled projections and storm modeling (Hall, Barnard, Holmquist, Brown), habitat characterization and risks (Thorne, Buffington, Dugger, De La Cruz), sediment studies (Ganju, Ambrose, Brown, Holmquist), and accretion processes (Guntenspergen, Thorne).  \r\n\r\nOur objectives include extensive studies across all California network sites and intensive studies at two selected sites.  Extensive studies include: 1) work with CERCC network site managers to continue quarterly tidal meter (water level, salinity, temp) and Surface Elevation Tables (SETs) readings to capture storm events such as atmospheric rivers; 2) augment the Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) at fine resolution (10s of meters) developing a coastal change module including flooding and erosion; and 3) integrate findings for an agent-based, decision simulation model (Envision) developed with LCC support.  At intensive studies (Seal Beach, s. CA, Mediterranean climate; Humboldt Bay, n. CA, Oceanic climate), we will examine: 4) site-specific community response to inundation by growing plants at different elevations in marsh organs, belowground production with in-growth bags, decomposition rates, and soil salinity; 5) sediment flux measurements augmented by an array of water samplers to determine spatial patterns of suspended sediment concentrations over the marsh on 4 high tides to apply to a spatially-explicit accretion model; and 6) sedimentational, palynological, plant macrofossil, and malacological records from sediment cores (14C, 210Pb, or Cs chronologies) related to past hydrological disturbances and storms (compared with Obj. 4), long-term resilience of marsh vegetation, a surface sampling grid to reconstruct 3-D changes in marsh sedimentation including storms and channel evulsions to assess marsh topographic stability (linked to Obj. 5) where records from retrospective core studies will be correlated with intermediate climate variability (ENSO, PDO, Little Ice-Age, Medieval Climate Anomaly), storms, and tectonic changes.  \r\n\r\n"}, {"type": "FY 14 Grant ($117,925)", "value": "G14AP00178"}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus":

As proofs of concept, we will initiate projects with multiple research groups in the Southwest. These groups are working directly with decision-makers in the Department of the Interior to project biological responses to climate extremes. Examples include responses of Mojave desert tortoises  and fire dynamics to drought or high winter precipitation; responses of salt marshes to frequent, intense storms; and potential increases in heat-related illnesses among visitors to national parks. The proposed work is a cooperative effort among Southwest Climate Science Center investigators. We will integrate the diverse expertise of host institutions to provide access to data, expert knowledge, and tools for technology transfer."}, {"type": "FY 14 Grant ($457,931)", "value": "G14AP00076"}], "projectProducts": [], "projectStatus": "In Progress"}, {"annualBudgets": [{"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds": 457931.0, "year": "2014"}, {"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds": 448199.0, "year": "2015"}, {"fundingSources": [], "totalFunds": 462440.74, "year": "2016"}], "className": "gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.BudgetFacet", "facetName": "Budget", "parts": [{"type": "Award Type", "value": "Grant"}, {"type": "Award Number", "value": "G14AP00076 "}], "totalFunds": 1368570.74}], "files": [{"checksum": {"type": "MD5", "value": "4b75a4df7a380f05b45739b8ba85dc92"}, "contentEncoding": null, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "dateUploaded": "2016-10-31T18:24:38Z", "downloadUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0", "imageHeight": 1365, "imageWidth": 1818, "name": "SW-2014-2_Drought_SanLuisReservoir_CA_CynthiaMendoza_USDA.jpg", "originalMetadata": false, "pathOnDisk": "__disk__82/8d/2c/828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0", "previewImage": {"large": {"height": 751, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0&width=1000&height=751", "width": 1000}, "medium": {"height": 435, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0&width=580&height=435", "width": 580}, "small": {"height": 263, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0&width=350&height=263", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 113, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0&width=150&height=113", "width": 150}}, "processToken": null, "processed": false, "s3Object": null, "size": 858234, "title": "Drought-impacted San Luis Reservoir, CA - Credit: Cynthia Mendoza, USDA", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0", "useForPreview": true, "viewUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0&width=1818&height=1365"}], "hasChildren": true, "id": "54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c", "identifiers": [{"key": "6bd2be23-872b-4e50-83fb-10a4bb0b68d9", "scheme": "NCCWSC", "type": "RegistrationUUID"}, {"key": "SW13-PH0002", "scheme": "NCCWSC", "type": "StampID"}], "link": {"rel": "self", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c"}, "parentId": "531dd8c3e4b04cb293ee78ee", "previewImage": {"from": "attachedFile", "large": {"height": 751, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0&width=1000&height=751", "width": 1000}, "medium": {"height": 435, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0&width=580&height=435", "width": 580}, "original": {"height": 1365, "size": 858234, "title": "Drought-impacted San Luis Reservoir, CA - Credit: Cynthia Mendoza, USDA", "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0", "viewUri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0&width=1818&height=1365", "viewUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?deprecated=__use__viewUri__instead__&f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0&width=1818&height=1365", "width": 1818}, "small": {"height": 263, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0&width=350&height=263", "width": 350}, "thumbnail": {"height": 113, "uri": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/54134768e4b0239f1986bc1c?f=__disk__82%2F8d%2F2c%2F828d2c761c28108189e00993430ecf03f3d3f5c0&width=150&height=113", "width": 150}}, "provenance": {"dateCreated": "2014-09-12T19:20:08Z", "harvesterCode": "rfpManager-1.119.4 gov.usgs.eventManager.ScienceBaseService.store()", "html": "rfpManager-1.119.4", "lastUpdated": "2017-03-16T15:45:59Z"}, "purpose": "We will improve estimates of extreme temperature and precipitation, evaluate the responses of natural resources to climate extremes, and make it easier to obtain customized climate information for all or any part of the Southwest.

Thus, even when there is no change in fire intensity (the amount of heat released during a fire), fire severity (the number of trees killed) may increase. \r\n\r\nProcedures/Methods: We will examine this question across the southwestern United States using existing national-scale prescribed fire monitoring databases supplemented with tree-ring analyses. Fire effects data (e.g., crown scorch) will be combined with empirical models relating climate to tree growth to understand the influence of climatic stress on post-fire mortality patterns. We expect our models to show drought stress resulting in lower (or more variable) patterns of tree growth, which in turn will increase sensitivity to fire-caused injuries. Evidence for these patterns would imply positive feedbacks between current observed warming trends and sensitivity of trees to fire, complicating forest conservation and management. \r\n\r\nExpected Products and Information/Technology Transfer: We will communicate our findings to scientists, managers and the public through peer-reviewed journal articles, presentations and web-based outreach materials. We will make our data \u201copen access\u201d following publication to encourage further work on this topic.\r\n\r\nPersonnel/Cooperators/Partners: Our research team has extensive publication records in top journals in the fields of climate change impacts, fire science, forest ecology and tree-ring analysis.

Might the effects of drought and fire combine to cause even greater risks for southwestern forests in the future? This research tries to solve part of this puzzle by discovering how drought might weaken trees, leading to increased tree death following fires. It is important to understand how drought and fire might work together to cause tree death; more frequent tree deaths will mean compromised wildlife habitat, increased erosion and greater carbon emissions following fires across the Southwest. Scientists from the USGS, University of Arizona and the National Park Service will work together using existing data coupled with tree ring analyses and detailed climate data to determine how all these factors fit together in recent fires. If we understand how these factors interact now, we can develop better estimates of the effects of fires in the future.", "relatedItems": {"link": {"rel": "related", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=52afcd25e4b0978c01d10430"}}, "spatial": {"boundingBox": {"maxX": -103.001964333, "maxY": 42.009518333, "minX": -124.409590667, "minY": 31.332172667}, "representationalPoint": [-113.70577750000001, 36.6708455], "representationalPointIsDerived": true}, "subTitle": "How Does Climatic Stress at Intermediate Timescales Influence Fire Severity?", "summary": "There is a growing realization that current warming trends may be associated with increases in the size, frequency, and severity of forest fires in the West. While rising temperatures can create drought conditions that favor severe fires, it is also possible that drought limits the ability of trees to survive a fire. During a drought, there is less water available for trees and more outbreaks of harmful insects and pathogens can occur, both of which can weaken trees. Tree mortality is one means of measuring the severity of a fire, and evidence shows that trees exposed to drought conditions for periods of 5-10 years are already more sensitive to the effects of fire \u2013 suggesting that drought could indeed increase fire severity.

phenomenon known as atmospheric rivers (ARs) has gained increasing attention due to its strong connections to floods, snowpacks and water supplies in the West Coast states. Relatively less is known about the ecological implications of ARs, particularly in the interior Southwest, where AR storms are less common. To address this gap, we compared a chronology of AR landfalls on the west coast between 1989-2011 and between 25-42.5\u00baN, to annual metrics of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; an indicator of vegetation productivity) and daily-resolution precipitation data to assess influences of AR-fed winter precipitation on vegetation productivity across the southwestern US. We mapped correlations between winter AR precipitation during landfalling ARs and 1) annual maximum NDVI and 2) area burned by large wildfires summarized by ecoregion during the same year as the landfalls and during the following year. The data produced by this study include four sets of eight raster grids (total = 32 grids) representing Spearman Rank correlation coefficients for four types of comparisons across eight different latitudinal bands. Each dataset is named according to the comparison type and latitude of AR landfall. The four types of comparisons (with corresponding filenames indicated in parentheses) include: 1) annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. total annual winter precipitation (AR_WinterPrecip), 2) annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. annual maximum NDVI (AR_NDVI), 3) spatially-averaged annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. area burned by wildfire during the same year by Level IV ecoregion (AR_Fire_SameYear), and 4) spatially-averaged annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. area burned by wildfire with a 1-year lag by Level IV ecoregion (AR_Fire_OneYearLag).

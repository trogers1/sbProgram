This region contains millions of wetlands in which waterfowl breed and from which 50-80% of the continent's migratory ducks originate each year.  Previous modeling efforts indicated that climate change would result in a shift of suitable waterfowl breeding habitat from the central PPR to the southeastern portion of the region, an area where the majority of wetlands have been drained. If this future scenario were to materialize, a significant restoration effort would be needed in the southeastern PPR to support waterfowl production. However, more recent research has revealed that changes in climate are influencing these critical wetland habitats in novel ways, and previous modeling results may no longer be valid. Land and natural resource managers are in need of more accurate, up-to-date scientific information in order to make fully informed planning decisions about these important wetlands and waterfowl habitat.  This project aims to improve our understanding of how future climate changes might impact wetland ecosystems and waterfowl habitats of the PPR. Project researchers are using a newly developed wetland simulation model to simulate hydrologic and chemical conditions of prairie pothole wetlands under various climate change scenarios. Results will be compared to results from previous modeling and analysis efforts to gain a better understanding of future impacts to wetlands and the ability of prairie pothole wetlands to continue meeting the habitat needs of breeding waterfowl. Throughout this effort, the project team is working directly with land managers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Habitat and Population Evaluation Team and Chase Lake Wetland Management District in North Dakota to ensure that study results and science products can directly inform climate adaptation plans for waterfowl habitat.

Developing predictions of future conditions is often the first step in helping decision makers and communities plan for change. However, to date, available global climate models have been too coarse in resolution to be useful for planning in the context of small, isolated islands.  This project produced the first-ever set of high-resolution climate projections for Guam and American Samoa, providing information on key variables of interest to decision makers such as rainfall, air temperature, and tropical cyclone patterns. Modeling results suggest that both territories are expected to become warmer and experience a higher number of extreme rainfall events through the current century. In addition, American Samoa is projected to become wetter overall, with a mean rainfall increase of up to 25 percent by the late 21st century, and Guam may be subject to a higher frequency of strong tropical cyclones. These data will be used by other researchers to inform hydrological and ecosystem models and, ultimately, aid local decision makers as they plan for climate change impacts and seek to reduce risk through effective adaptation.

Stakeholders, including state agencies, federal agencies, Tribal nations, Pueblos, and private groups are particularly concerned about the impact that non-native Brown Trout have on native cutthroat trout.   This project will be the first to demonstrate how non-native Brown Trout negatively affect Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout populations. The project has two primary objectives: 1) compare the health and characteristics of native Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout in areas both with and without invasive Brown Trout in cold and warm streams; and 2) determine if competition with invasive Brown Trout for food resources is associated with reductions in Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout populations. Understanding the relationship between temperature and non-native species invasion for this southernmost subspecies of cutthroat trout will benefit all cutthroat subspecies into the future as northern latitudes endure the effects of both a warming climate and continued non-native trout invasions.   Although the Rio Grande cutthroat trout is not at immediate risk of extinction according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, more than half of the remaining populations are considered to be in fair or poor condition. Results from this project will be valuable and useful for managers tasked with balancing Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout restoration efforts while maintaining popular sportfish destinations.

However, to date, limited data and the uncertain effects of climate change have hindered predictions of future streamflow.  Through this project, scientists developed a model that provides a way to estimate future stream low flow (streamflow during a period of prolonged dryness) by categorizing streams based on their physical characteristics. While the model is based on data from gaged streams (i.e., those fitted with measuring devices to monitor streamflow), it allows researchers to also predict streamflow at ungaged (unmonitored) sites and thus develop island- or state-wide predictions of stream response to future rainfall conditions.  Researchers used the model to forecast flow changes in Maui streams under two possible end-of-century future climate scenarios. Results indicate that in areas where rainfall is projected to decrease in the future, stream low flow may decrease by more than 50 percent in some areas, and habitat for native species may decrease by more than 25 percent in some streams.

Climate change is challenging the long-term persistence of many cultural resources. For example, those located in coastal areas, such as historic lighthouses, are threatened by sea-level rise, shoreline erosion, and more frequent severe storm events. While climate change challenges managers of both natural and cultural resources to make decisions in the face of uncertainty, far less work has been done to identify the impacts of climate change on cultural resources, compared to natural resources.    To address this critical gap, researchers are developing a strategy to aid decision makers in climate adaptation planning efforts. The strategy integrates assessments of the relative significance of specific cultural resources and their vulnerability to climate change. The strategy will be pilot tested with a subset of buildings listed on the National Historic Register at Cape Look National Seashore, located on North Carolina\u2019s barrier islands.

Managers are searching for strategies that minimize the negative effects of drought on forests (i.e. increase their resistance to drought) and maximize the ability of forests to recover after a drought (i.e. improve their resilience). Evidence suggests that forests with certain combinations of tree species, sizes, and stem densities are better able to withstand and recover from drought.   The goal of this study is to identify which forest management practices best minimize drought impacts for a range of forest types and climates in the U.S. Researchers are using eight long-term forest management experiments that are already underway across the country to identify how different forest management practices can increase the resistance and resilience of forests to drought. Practices such as forest thinning, a technique in which certain trees are selectively removed to make room for others, have been shown to help reduce the stress experienced by the remaining trees during drought and to increase recovery rates following drought.

In this study, researchers are exploring how the timing and occurrence of a number of highly migratory marine animals is changing due to a series of climatic and ecological shifts. First, using existing long-term historical data series, they will determine the direction and magnitude of how migration, abundance, or other phenological factors have changed for marine mammals, sea turtles, and fishes that migrate into the Gulf of Maine on a seasonal basis. Because marine animals are inherently difficult to detect, the team will apply dynamic occupancy models to evaluate seasonal migration patterns and habitat use across multiple habitats in the Gulf of Maine region.

The North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered whale species on the planet. In the North Atlantic Ocean, ship strikes and entanglements with commercial fishing gear represent fatal threats to right whales. Recent reports suggest that North Atlantic right whale migration patterns have changed. Many researchers posit that shifts in migration are responsible for recent increases in the overlap between right whales and human activities, especially fishing. To help understand how changes in right whale movements and behaviors may overlap with ship traffic, and thus put the animals at risk of encountering vessels, we will combine right whale habitat models with ship traffic maps. The end result will be a set of maps identifying risk levels.

Unfortunately, climate change may be putting the species at further risk. Sea-level rise, increased storm frequency, and changes in temperature and humidity could reduce the suitability of habitat used by loggerheads and other endangered sea turtles for nesting and feeding.   This project assessed the vulnerability of key sea turtle nesting beaches to climate change in the Southeast. Researchers examined previous records of sea turtle nesting locations in the Southeast to identify the characteristics of these beaches, then predicted the future suitability of these beaches for nesting based on projected climate change. Beaches on both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are expected to be very susceptible to change associated with sea-level rise, making it imperitive that we understand how these changes will affect the suitability of nesting sites.   The results of this work can be used to directly inform federal recovery efforts for the loggerhead sea turtle. Identifying locations where beach habitat will no longer be suitable for nesting will help managers determine what action needs to be taken to protect loggerheads, such as moving nests out of highly vulnerable areas. Further, some of the nesting beaches used by loggerheads are also used by other endangered sea turtles, such as the Kemp\u2019s ridley, green, and leatherback sea turtles. Therefore, this project represents a vulnerability assessment of coastal nesting habitat for multiple species of national conservation concern.

Warming temperatures may have a significant impact on snow and may therefore affect the entire water cycle of the region. A decrease in precipitation in the form of snow, or \u201csnow drought\u201d, can manifest in several ways including changes to total snowfall amounts, snow accumulation, and the timing/length of the snow season. Understanding these changes is then critical for understanding and predicting a variety of climate impacts to wildlife and ecosystems. However, little research has been conducted to date to understand how this change may impact high-latitude ecosystems, and, unfortunately, traditional methods used by scientists to measure and characterize drought do not apply to snowfall-dominated areas.   This project seeks to address this lack of information by determining the most effective definitions of \u201csnow drought\u201d in Alaska, exploring the features and events that indicate the occurrence of snow drought, understanding the gaps between how we measure snow at single locations via gauges (meteorological snow drought) vs. snowpack conditions (hydrological snow drought), and determining how land cover and terrain affect the susceptibility of an area to snow drought.  This project will use existing datasets (e.g. ground observations, remote sensing, and computer models) to understand the arrival and departure of snowpack and the speed that the snow is melting, and to observe how changing landscapes and ecosystems, including the occurrence of fire, might be impacting snow accumulation and melt.

Our lack of knowledge regarding the status results from the common belief that inland fishery harvests are widely under reported (FAO 2009; Welcomme et al. 2010), particularly the contributions from recreational, artisanal, and illegal fisheries (FAO 2003; Allan et al. 2005). Overcoming this knowledge gap has no simple solution, given that resources to conduct on-the-ground fisheries assessments are lacking throughout much of the world, particularly in Africa or Asia where the majority of the inland fisheries harvest for subsistence and commercial purposes occurs (FAO 2003). At the local level, the lack of reliable data on the status of fish populations constrains the ability of managers to intervene when fisheries are in decline, until the system has virtually collapsed. It is worth reemphasizing that sustainable inland fisheries are essential in the battle towards poverty eradication and improved nutrition in many of the least developed countries, and that poverty eradication is one of the key Millennium Development Goals set forth by the United Nations. Inland systems also will be vulnerable to changes in climate and land use in the coming century (Ficke et al. 2007; Brander 2007), and knowledge gaps in status and function of inland fisheries will exacerbate the inability of managers to mitigate climate-induced changes in fish populations. Relative to marine systems, habitats in inland systems will likely be more influenced by changes in precipitation patterns (and water levels) and thermal structure, and landlocked inland fish species likely have less ability to migrate to optimal water temperatures.   This project aimed to develop tools to narrow existing knowledge gaps on the status and key drivers of inland fisheries, given their importance in providing food and a means for poverty alleviation for people in developing countries and in driving economies in developed countries. By providing models that provide potentially less biased estimates of fish production as well as some key variables that could predict fish production, managers would have better information to both manage these key fisheries and their allied ecosystems presently and prepare for the effective governance of these resources in the face of future local and global climate, land and water induced changes.", "casc": "National CASC"}, "55e07a67e4b0f42e3d040f3c": {"size": 2474289, "title": "The Available Science Assessment Process (ASAP) Continued: Evaluating Adaptation Actions for Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Change in the Pacific Northwest", "fy": "2015", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55e07a67e4b0f42e3d040f3c", "summary": "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing resource management.

Low rainfall and record high temperatures resulted in increased tree mortality and complete forest diebacks across the West. Though land managers scrambled to respond, they lacked information needed to make informed decisions. Focusing on California\u2019s central and southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, this project seeks to determine whether a key forest management practice \u2013 forest thinning via prescribed fire \u2013 can help forests better survive drought.   Prescribed fire is commonly used in the western U.S. to remove potential wildfire fuel, such as small trees and shrubs. It is also thought that this act of selectively removing trees helps remaining trees better survive drought events, because there is less competition for water. However, this proposition has never been formally tested. This project aims to identify whether current prescribed burning practices are sufficient to help forests survive drought, or whether these practices need to be implemented more intensively to meet this goal under increasingly frequent drought.   This project will answer questions at the forefront of research needs across federal land management agencies in California. Results will (1) help National Park Service staff make planning decisions to preserve giant sequoias at Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks; (2) help fire managers at the parks identify the effectiveness of different fire treatments and whether prescribed burning should be implemented as a drought resistance strategy; and (3) inform strategic planning efforts of the U.S. Forest Service on where and how much to thin forest stands, as well as inform plans for restoring landscapes impacted by major wildfires.

The basin has a long history of development and diversion of water resources, meaning that streamflow records that reflect natural, unmanaged flows over the past century have been rare. As a result, research on the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation in driving droughts and surface water variability in the Missouri River Basin has lagged behind similar work done in other major basins in the country, and has hindered drought planning efforts.   To address this need, researchers will use tree-rings to develop reconstructions of historic, natural streamflow in the Upper Missouri River Basin. This will be the first such network of hydrologic reconstructions for the basin. Specifically, the tree-ring analysis will provide information on precipitation, temperature, and streamflow for the basin going back 800 years. This historical information will then be used to explore the drivers of drought and periods of high flow in the basin, beyond just precipitation. For example, evidence suggests that temperature is an increasingly important driver of drought, and an analysis of the impacts of warming temperatures on streamflow can be used to help managers anticipate future impacts on water supplies in the basin. Lastly, researchers will work closely with engineers and water managers with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to integrate information on droughts and natural variability in streamflow into their water operations and drought planning efforts.

We evaluated climate responses of sagebrush using two approaches: (1) experimental manipulations of temperature and precipitation for natural plants in the field, and (2) assessment of how climate adaptation and weather have affected sagebrush seeding efforts on nearly 25 large-scale sagebrush seeding projects done over the past several decades. Experimental warming increased growth of sagebrush in high-elevation meadows in the Teton Mountains, but had marginal or no effect at lower elevations sites (near Twin Falls and Boise, Idaho, respectively). Increased precipitation enhanced sagebrush abundance, along with flowering and stem growth, particularly when added in winter on deep soils. In the post-fire seeding study, we found sagebrush abundances to be highly variable across different seeding projects, and the variation was partly related to the climate of seeding and seed-source sites and weather. Sagebrush seeds typically traveled hundreds of kilometers and nearly 1000 m downhill from seed source/origins to seeding sites, from sites with colder minimum temperatures than the seeding sites. Big sagebrush is comprised of subspecies that differ in their climate adaptation, and many seeding projects received a subspecies that differed from the native type requested by the land managers. These climate transfers appeared important to the success of seedings: successful seedings imported seeds from sites having the same minimum temperatures. In failed  seedings, seeds originated from relatively colder sites and, moreover, years with relatively warm minimum temperatures prevailed following planting. These results suggest minimum  temperature and winter precipitation responses are important factors in the climate adaptation and ecology of this desert shrub, and their consideration in climate vulnerability analyses and selection of seed sources is likely to improve land planning and restoration.

There are three central research questions:    \tTo what extent are climatic stressors, and their impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods and habitability, already driving migration in RMI? \tWhat are the impacts of migration in source and destinations areas? \tHow do migration reasons and consequences vary among different types of respondents?  This project will examine the extent to which we can identify direct and indirect links between patterns of human migration and climate events. As a next step, the projects\u2019 research findings on migration decision-making could be integrated into agent-based models that use projections of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services to understand which islands and communities are at highest risk and from where we can expect most migration to take place in the future.

However, effective two-way conversations between scientists and stakeholders are often limited, due to resource constraints, a lack of necessary communication skills and tools, and other factors.   A mechanism for better communication between scientists and stakeholders is needed to facilitate the successful exchange of scientific information. This project aims to address this need by developing the ScienceTapes project, an initiative to record and archive conversations between research scientists and non-scientists in order to share science stories to build connections between people, science, and the environment to create a greater understanding of change in Alaska\u2019s llandscapes.   The project team is partnering with StoryCorps and has trained a group of volunteers to facilitate effective conversations between two people. The volunteers then participated in facilitating, recording and archiving the conversations. Since the initial training period ScienceTapes has set up listening stations at events and conferences across Alaska. The team has facilitated over 60 conversations, with 49 currently archived with StoryCorps and the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. ScienceTapes has recorded conversations with a wide-array of people, including research scientists, students ( from elementary to graduate level), decision makers, resource managers, engineers, rural community members, politicians, Alaskan elders (rural and urban), film makers, and media personnel.    Several of the recordings from the first year have been processed into shorter pieces that can be accessed on the project\u2019s pilot website (www.sciencetapes.org). The project coordinators also intend to create a model for science communication that can be applied to a variety of other science communication needs in the larger science community. As the ScienceTapes team moves past its collaboration and partnership with StoryCorps, the focus of the project will be expanded.

These phenological events are linked to weather and climate, and as temperature and precipitation patterns have changed, some spring events are occurring earlier. These changes in plant phenology can have cascading effects on wildlife such as elk, moose, and mule deer, which depend on plants for food. It\u2019s thought that the quality of forage available in the spring could play a critical role for these big game species, which need to replenish energy depleted during the winter, in order to survive and successfully reproduce. Climate change will alter plant phenology, which in turn is likely to effect when, where, and for how long big game species can access the best quality food.   In mountainous areas, spring green-up occurs in a wave, beginning first at lower elevations before reaching higher elevations. Thus, to extend the amount of time that individuals are exposed to the highest quality food, they should follow this wave of spring green-up. The goal of this project is to determine whether mule deer track the spring green-up of vegetation as they migrate from their low elevation winter range to their high elevation summer range. While it\u2019s been hypothesized that mule deer and other herbivores \u201csurf the green wave\u201d \u2013 or track spring green-up \u2013 the question remains as to whether this behavior occurs or is common among big game species. To answer this question, researchers are tracking the movements of mule deer in Wyoming and are matching the progression of the green wave using GPS telemetry and remote-sensing technology.   So far, researchers have found that migratory mule deer do in fact surf the green wave. This result indicates that migratory routes are more than just a link between seasonal ranges; rather, they represent an important source of high-quality vegetation that mule deer can access by carefully timing their movements during spring migration. This means that changes in plant phenology resulting from shifting climate conditions could pose a threat to big game species like mule deer, potentially altering the quality and quantity of forage obtained during migration.

For example, plants might be relocated to support pollinator conservation or the restoration of prairies. Some land managers, in an effort to be proactive in the face of changing environmental conditions, are also considering relocating plants to sites that are considered more similar to anticipated future conditions. However, moving plants can be ecologically and economically risky. It\u2019s possible that pests, pathogens, or contaminant weeds can be inadvertently moved along with the target plant material. In 2016, the noxious weed Palmer amaranth was introduced to Minnesota as a contaminant in seed brought in to improve Monarch butterfly and pollinator habitat. This fast growing weed is capable of reducing soybean yields by 78% and corn yields by 91%, and requires costly resources to fight its spread.   One factor that impacts the risk associated with plant movement is the distance between the source of the plant and where it is being relocated to. If the source is located near the translocation site, it is less likely to be contaminated with new weeds or pathogens. The goal of this project is to create a framework for evaluating risk associated with the movement of plant material. The first tier of the framework will describe the future condition of the species, site, or community of concern, if plant movement is implemented and if it is not. The second tier will assess the ecological risks associated with moving plant material. This will include identifying potential pathogens, weeds, and pests that might be associated with plants from different areas and could be inadvertently introduced during translocation, and evaluating the potential harm these species might cause if introduced.

This approach will help ensure that the science being produced on ecological drought is actionable \u2013 that is, it addresses critical stakeholder questions, takes into account the complex social dynamics of drought adaptation, and can be easily used by decision-makers.   The ultimate goal of the working group is to use integrated social-ecological analysis to forecast the potential implications of drought, to provide better access to climate and drought-related data, and to develop tools that enable managers to visualize the potential impacts of management decisions before they are implemented.

The quantity of water flowing into the northern section of the river depends on how much snowpack from the Rocky Mountains melts into runoff and on seasonal precipitation rates. Models describing the relationship between winter snowpack quantity and springtime snowmelt runoff quantities for the basin are combined with models describing long-term natural variation in precipitation to create water supply outlooks. The outlooks developed by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service are currently used by stakeholders to make critical water allocation decisions in the basin. Improvements to water supply outlooks could be worth millions of dollars associated with better water allocation strategies.   In order to ensure that these outlooks are as accurate as possible for water management planning, there is a need to better understand how snowpack and snowmelt runoff are related to each other and how both may be influenced by large climatic variation such as El Ni\u00f1o and global climate change. To address this need, this project will combine historical data and climate model projections to develop enhanced prediction models relating winter snowpack to subsequent snowmelt runoff in the upper Rio Grande.   The results of this research will identify changes to streamflow predictability over the past several decades (a period of rapid observed warming), and assess future predictability. This work will also help to inform the development of more reliable water supply outlooks essential for planning purposes in the Rio Grande Basin, such as reservoir management and irrigated agriculture.

Therefore, characterizing long term vegetation cycles can provide critical insight into how the behavior and health of a number of species may be altered due to climate change.   This project seeks to identify how drought conditions influence vegetation phenology, in order to better understand the potential effects on herbivores. Specifically, researchers will examine (1) if drought causes spring  green-up to occur earlier in the year; (2) if drought causes a shorter spring green-up period, thus reducing the window during which high-quality vegetation is available for herbivores; and (3) how the spatial patterns of plant productivity vary during drought years.   Identifying the effects of drought on vegetation will help wildlife managers better understand and predict changes in the behavior and health of herbivores during periods of drought.

Scientists at the USGS, academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) examined the linkages between climate, hydrology, and the biological factors that influence riparian and wetland ecosystem resilience and migratory bird communities. To this end, we (1) collectively developed a synthesis document exploring the linkages between the myriad of elements determining climate change effects on bird communities and communicated this state-of-knowledge to wildlife managers; (2) downscaled data using statistical and dynamical approaches that produce ensemble climate models; (3) developed models to forecast climate effects on water and biological outcomes on wetlands in the northern Great Plains; (4) developed models that relate climate predictions to snowmelt timing, stream flow, water management, and the phenology and growth of native and invasive riparian plants, (5) predicted migrant bird responses to changes in phenology and habitats; and (6) examine the role of phenotypic plasticity in avian responses to climate change. By exploring the effects of altered climate and habitat conditions on riparian-dependent birds using a holistic approach that incorporates both top-down and bottom-up constraints, we can better predict changes in riparian ecosystems and responses of migratory birds to those changes.

Yet to date, little comprehensive research has been conducted to investigate the effects of climate change on inland fisheries at a large scale.    The aim of this project was to summarize the current state of knowledge, identify data gaps, and suggest future research directions around four major themes dealing with climate related impacts on fishes and fisheries. To answer these questions, researchers lead a workshop for experts in climate change and fish ecology from universities, state and provincial governments, and federal agencies throughout the U.S. and Canada. Together, the experts compiled the findings of 48 studies, mainly focused on salmon and trout, and solicited feedback from inland fishery experts around the world.  The findings of this effort show that climate change is poised to impact inland fish in a variety of ways. For example, some fish, especially coldwater species such as brook trout, will likely become stressed by the new conditions, while others (e.g., smallmouth bass) may thrive. These results provide a baseline of current knowledge on inland fisheries and climate change that can inform future research and help focus conservation efforts.

Results show that coastal erosion is expected to significantly increase on Kaua\u02bbi, doubling its historic rate by 2050 and leading to partial or total loss of 90 percent of beaches by 2100.  The Hawai\u02bbi Department of Land and Natural Resources, local planning departments, and other coastal management agencies are using this project\u2019s data and maps for hazard preparedness and adaptation planning on state and local scales. Results were incorporated into a statewide study of shoreline sea-level rise vulnerability led by the Hawai\u02bbi State Interagency Climate Adaptation Committee. While this study focused on Kaua\u02bbi, it established a methodology for predicting future beach erosion that is now being applied to other areas of the state to improve coastal management decision making.

However, forests located within urban and suburban areas \u2013 \u201curban forests\u201d are capable of supporting diverse plant and animal life, and could play an increasingly important role in conservation as urbanization continues.  Little is currently known about how specific aspects of urbanization, such as higher temperatures and pollution, affect the quality of forests as habitat for plants and animals. This project will synthesize information on how these factors affect urban forest habitat quality, identify knowledge gaps that impede forest management, and propose future research directions to fill those gaps. Specifically, researchers will review scientific literature to address the following questions: (1) How do factors such as heat and pollution from light, noise, and chemicals, affect forest quality for different plants and animals?; (2) How do factors such as tree pests and invasive plants and animals affect forest quality for different plants and animals?; and (3) How does urban forest size and spatial arrangement interact with these factors to affect forest quality?   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service faces unique challenges in managing urban forest resources, particularly threatened and endangered species, in the rapidly urbanizing Southeast. The results of this project will provide information on the role that urban forests can play in achieving conservation goals, ultimately supporting the Department of the Interior in preparing for the unique challenges of this growing resource and identifying existing knowledge gaps so that funds can be directed towards answering the most crucial questions.

However, wetlands in this region and elsewhere are threatened by sea-level rise and other climate-related changes. According to a USFWS and NOAA report, between 2004 and 2009, 80,000 acres of wetland were lost on average each year, which is a significant increase from the previous six years.

Their survival and reproduction is dependent on sufficient winter habitat and food sources, which may be threatened by climate change.  During the winter, caribou eat lichens (organisms made up of algae and fungus) that grow on the snow-covered ground. Lichens will likely have a complex response to climate change, affected in different ways by factors like changing precipitation, wildfire, and competition with plants. For example, as temperatures warm, there will likely be less snow cover, exposing more of the lichen to caribou. Simultaneously, increased fire frequency could reduce lichen availability.  Moose, on the other hand, eat the twigs of deciduous shrubs that stick up above the snow. Unlike lichen, shrub habitats may actually be affected positively by increased fire. Warmer temperatures and less snow are also likely to increase shrub biomass.  Project researchers are using the Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Model to unravel some of these complex relationships and estimate the effects of climate change on food availability for these two species throughout most of Alaska and parts of Canada (from about 1970-2100).

Researchers conducted structured interviews with elders from the Yurok Tribe and used ethnographic methods to analyze the results. From this analysis, several general themes emerged. For example, Yurok elders have a good understanding of how the environment has changed over the last 200 years. They identified numerous species, including salmon, sturgeon, elk, and porcupine, whose populations have undergone serious declines in the past century. In addition, elders were particularly concerned about observed changes in temperature, flow, and water quality of the Klamath River.

Stream temperatures fluctuate a lot during the year and temperature may or may not control where an insect lives. Field insects were collected and sent to a laboratory for testing several temperature endpoints, particularly at higher temperatures. Respiration, breathing rate, and some physical activities were expected to increase, as the insects attempt to deal with elevated temperatures and expected oxygen limitations. Previous research found that oxygen limitation results in the build-up of lactic and uric acids in tissues of insects, but this was not observed over the range of temperatures and types of insects tested for this study. While respiration, breathing rate and, physical behavior such as pumping motions were observed, it did not appear that elevated temperature alone was resulting in oxygen limitation. This was further confirmed with more experiments that looked specifically at low oxygen waters at various temperatures and included an evaluation of the insect\u2019s metabolic waste products; these warm temperature challenges did not suggest an oxygen deficit in these insects. Rather, the experiments suggested a more general elevated metabolic demand where the insects had to work harder to breath, eat, and molt.

Therefore, the reduced production, or absence, of cheatgrass in previously invaded areas during years of adequate precipitation could be seen as a windfall. However, this cheatgrass dieoff phenomenon creates other problems for land managers like accelerated soil erosion, loss of early spring food supply for livestock and wildlife, and unknown recovery pathways. We used satellite data and scientific techniques to map annual estimated cheatgrass percent cover and areas of cheatgrass dieoff in the western and central parts of the northern Great Basin from 2000 - 2010. For this same area, we developed a map of cheatgrass percent cover variability and another map that displays cheatgrass dieoff probability.  These maps can assist land managers in understanding when and where cheatgrass did and did not exist over an extremely large landscape, and the maps can possibly explain characteristics of dieoff areas that can help researchers pinpoint the cause or causes of cheatgrass dieoff. The cheatgrass dieoff maps show that dieoff areas are spatially and temporally variable, or, in other words, a dieoff may afflict an area for a few years and then cheatgrass may return, only to dieoff again later. This pattern of variability can also persist in different areas. During the study period we estimated that, on average, about 2.6 million acres experienced cheatgrass dieoff annually.Restoring dieoff areas to a native ecosystem could be a goal of land managers, but until cheatgrass dieoff causes and natural recovery pathways are better understood, engaging in costly restoration activities may be unwise.

These droughts also stress vegetation, which can make it more difficult for forests to recover after fire. Forest regeneration in burned areas may be limited because seeds have to travel long distances to recolonize, and when they do arrive, conditions are often unfavorably hot and dry. Conifer forests in the region have demonstrated particular difficulty in recovering after fires, and in some cases have transformed into other ecosystem types, such as deciduous-dominated forests or grasslands. Such ecological transformations have implications not only for the plants and animals that depend on conifer forests for habitat, but also for the services that these forests provide humans.  Managers can support forest regeneration by planting tree seeds and seedlings, but effective response requires information on when and where such interventions would best be implemented. Focusing on conifer forests in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada mountains, this project aims to develop a tool that can support managers in planning for post-fire recovery activities. By exploring different scenarios of seed availability and short-term climate conditions, forecast maps will be developed that demonstrate potential forest regeneration patterns under wet or dry post-fire conditions and low or high seed input potential. Using this information, researchers will identify locations that could be particularly challenged to recover post-fire, and would be good candidates for seeding or planting efforts.

The multi-national, multi-state, ecologically diverse nature of this river makes management of the resource a complex task, especially in the context of more frequent droughts, changes in land use patterns, and increasing water use needs.  The purpose of this project was to review scientific monitoring and research reports and provide an overview of the state of the knowledge of the Upper Rio Grande-Rio Bravo Basin. The project researchers developed a report that synthesizes historical and geomorphic studies that describe the river\u2019s characteristics in the 1800s, its subsequent transformation caused by consumptive water use, dams, and physical manipulation of the channel, and a modern understanding of the natural and transformed flow regime. An extensive second section of the report focuses on aquatic ecology of the four major river segments of the Basin. In that section, the researchers summarize current understanding of the historical state compared to the contemporary state of the ecosystem, identify causes of ecosystem degradation, with an emphasis on those factors most affected by flow, and identify existing efforts to reverse ecosystem degradation, however intractable and dynamic these efforts may be.

This project sought to understand the ways in which Native American culture and cultural practices in the northwestern U.S. have been affected by climate change. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with tribal elders and cultural experts belonging to three Northwest tribes \u2013 the Confederated Tribes of Salish and Kootenai, the Qinault Indian Nation, and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians.  Researchers found that, in addition to altering some specific cultural practices, climate change is profoundly disrupting tribal identities. For tribes, one of the most significant effects of climate change is disturbance to the timing of natural cycles and seasonal changes, which have historically served as cues for culturally important activities. Many of the interviewees described a sense of unease associated with the fact that traditional wisdom may no longer be a sound basis for decision making, because environmental situations no longer match the information that has been passed down through generations. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the cultural effects of climate change on Northwest tribes and may serve as a resource for tribes to assess climate change impacts on their practices and identity.

However wildfire, which is becoming more common as temperatures rise, can disrupt the role of mountain forests in the hydrologic cycle. Uncertainty about the interactions between wildfire and snow-water, and how these interactions may change as climate conditions shift, impedes effective water resource planning in the region.  Until recently, there has been no method available to characterize the potential effects of forest fire on snow-water (water from melted snow) resources. This project will combine two newly developed models that will for the first time allow an accurate analysis of the effects of wildfire on snow-water resources, under current and possible future climate conditions.

The threat of rising sea levels to the essential infrastructure and cultural assets of island communities is well known. However, inadequate information limits the ability of resource managers to predict and prepare for the impacts of sea-level rise and associated inundation. Researchers will address this issue by collaborating with the National Park Service to identify the specific needs of managers at two national parks in Hawai\u2019i: the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument (VALR), which is home to the USS Arizona Memorial, and Pu\u2018uhonua O H\u014dnaunau National Historical Park (PUHO).

The goal of this project was to evaluate terrestrial connectivity across the South Central United States, with a focus on the impact of projected climate and land use changes.  The researchers addressed this goal using a variety of approaches, including evaluating connectivity of major habitat types (grasslands and forests), predicting future changes in landscape connectivity for grassland species, assessing terrestrial vertebrate diversity in relation to habitat loss and fragmentation, and analyzing the combined effects of climate and habitat fragmentation on the distributions of grassland bird species.  They found that connectivity has declined for species with a low to moderate ability to move across the landscape, and that this pattern is expected to continue under future scenarios of land-use change. For grassland birds, the contribution of climate, landscape variables, and their combined effects varied among species, but their combined effects can exceed the independent effects of the two drivers for some species. Thus, the importance of connectivity is expected to increase with the negative implications of climate change for wildlife populations and communities.

The gopher tortoise is a \u201ckeystone\u201d species, meaning that its disappearance from the landscape would jeopardize the existence of many other species that make use of its underground burrows.  Besides tortoise habitat, the uplands of the Coastal Plain contain isolated seasonal wetlands that are important for the life cycles of many amphibian species. The state of Georgia would like to conserve more of the landscape for the statewide protection of the gopher tortoise and associated natural communities.

The results of this project will assist wildlife managers in developing the most appropriate management strategy for pronghorns in the face of climate change and future drought conditions, thus contributing to the long-term conservation of this species in the Southwest.

To provide a proof of concept of the value of scenario planning in helping managers prepare for climate change, we conducted a pilot scenario planning effort aimed at helping state agencies in the northeastern United States develop climate-informed moose management goals and actions.  To encourage participation by wildlife managers, we provided several opportunities for them to learn about scenario planning and examples of its application in natural resource management. We shared this information via guidance documents on incorporating climate change into State Wildlife Action Plans, organized sessions at professional conferences, on-line presentations, periodic project newsletters, and small group meetings with state wildlife managers. These educational efforts reached well over 50 managers across the northeast and other parts of the country, and were successful in building interest in scenario planning. In September 2016, we partnered with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NY-DEC) to lead a 1-day scenario planning exercise focused on setting goals and objectives for a state-wide moose management plan. WCS then worked closely with scientists at the Northeast Climate Science Center to develop a set of future climate scenarios that are directly relevant to examining how the draft moose populations goals and objectives developed during the first workshop might hold up under different scenarios of climate change. These scenarios will be used by NY-DEC in Spring 2017 when they take their next steps to prepare a moose management plan for the state.  Results from this pilot project are being incorporated into a manuscript that will describe several recent uses of scenario planning by natural resource managers, and how lessons learned can help refine future uses of scenario planning for climate-informed wildlife management", "casc": "National CASC"}, "586fc81ee4b01a71ba0bc9e2": {"size": 644213, "title": "Permafrost Change and Impacts on Infrastructure and Resources in Alaska: A Synthesis of Past Work", "fy": "2016", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/586fc81ee4b01a71ba0bc9e2", "summary": "Permanently frozen ground, known as permafrost, is a critical feature of the Arctic landscape. As temperatures warm, permafrost is thawing, with potentially adverse impacts to infrastructure, communities, and the structure and function of Arctic ecosystems. However, the processes leading to changes in permafrost are not well understood, and there is a need to better understand the vulnerability of permafrost to thaw. Addressing these gaps in information regarding permafrost characteristics and dynamics, and what these changes will mean for human communities and ecosystems, will support management and planning efforts.   This project seeks to address these gaps through several mechanisms. First researchers have synthesized available information on the impacts of thawing permafrost on infrastructure and ecosystem services. The synthesis on permafrost and infrastructure highlights the need to better integrate data on current and future environmental conditions by bringing together engineers and scientists. The synthesis on ecosystem services, meanwhile, highlights the fact that permafrost is a critical landscape feature that supports drinking water availability, access to hunting and harvest areas, and fish and wildlife habitat.   A second component of this project has focused on synthesizing the distribution of surface water in the northern hemisphere in comparison to permafrost characteristics - such as permafrost extent, ground temperature, and thermokarst occurrence. Researchers used Landsat satellite data to identify the locations of water on the landscape and understand areas that have transition from water to land, between 1985 and 2015.

This process is recognized as one of the most pressing conservation issues in the Southeastern U.S. Habitat loss and fragmentation reduces the amount of suitable habitat available to wildlife species, divides wildlife populations and reduces genetic diversity, and interrupts important migration patterns; and climate change is likely to disrupt habitat areas even more. Maintaining connectivity between habitats and wildlife populations will be a key management strategy for conserving biodiversity in the region into the future.  Previous work by the research team modeled and mapped connectivity in the Southeast for three animals that inhabit bottomland forests, and showed where key connections in the landscape lie both currently and in the future. However, the researchers observed large variation in connectivity across geographical areas, time periods, and species. These results raised new questions about which connections are most important for management actions.  This project is building on this previous research with four approaches: 1) analyze consistency between this work and other connectivity efforts; 2) asses trade-offs between current and future connectivity; 3) extend work on the prioritization of core habitat areas and central points of connectivity; and 4) optimize the selection of sites for conservation action at the local scale.

Will they be stable or unstable? Will the waters be cold and clear or warm and muddy? Will they have salmon or other species? These questions motivated our two-year study of climate warming effects on headwater streams draining the Cascade Mountains. Using a novel combination of snow, geohydrology, and sediment transport models we assessed the vulnerability of stream channels to changing peak streamflow. Our snow modeling shows that with just a 2\u00b0C warming, snowfall shifts to rainfall at all elevations, peak snowpacks occur over two months earlier, and snowpacks are reduced by over half of historical values. Our geohydrology modeling shows that greater rainfall and earlier snowmelt enhances peak winter streamflows but impacts depend on snow amount and watershed geohydrology. In spring-fed watersheds, increased winter flows are within historical bounds. In runoff-dominated watersheds, increased winter flows will exceed the historical range by up to 44% and the frequency of high flows will increase by over 100 days per year. Since streambed gravels and sand are transported during high flows, climate warming is likely to result in a dramatic increase in the amount of sediment moving through Cascade streams. Daily sediment transport rates in the surface-runoff system could potentially double. Besides affecting water quality with increased levels of suspended sediment, more frequent sediment transport events may lead to instability in the gravels where bull trout and salmon lay their eggs, making their survival less certain in the future.

Phenological information can be used to identify when to survey for or treat invasive insects or plants, when to apply prescribed fire to maintain habitat, or when to prepare for peak tourist seasons in national parks. However, managers on-the-ground are often uncertain about how to best incorporate this information into their management practices.  With a focus on the Southwest U.S., this project will connect scientists and natural resource managers to ensure that managers are getting the right phenological information, in the right format, at the right time. Through a series of workshops, scientists with the USA National Phenology Network, the USGS, and universities will connect with resource managers from federal and state land management agencies, tribes, and private landholders to identify key decisions that would immediately benefit from phenological information. Through this engagement process, targeted products will be developed to address stakeholder-identified needs. Such products might include maps projecting green up of invasive plant species, such as buffelgrass, to inform the timing of the application of control treatments. Through documentation of this stakeholder-driven phenological needs assessment and product development process, this project can ultimately serve to support the initiation of similar efforts in other regions of the country.", "casc": "Southwest CASC"}, "595a75ece4b0d1f9f052839c": {"size": 332668, "title": "Climate Extremes and Ecological Impacts to California Estuaries", "fy": "2017", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/595a75ece4b0d1f9f052839c", "summary": "Estuaries are located at the interface where rivers meet the sea, creating unique ecosystems with complex physical and biological processes.

Coastal wetlands are also home to hundreds of migratory and resident wildlife species including threatened and endangered species of management concern. Wetlands also have the unique ability to increase their elevation relative to sea-level rise, therefore protecting nearby communities from flooding. In California, prolonged drought and extreme storm events are projected to increase with climate change, and when coupled with sea-level rise, the impacts could be severe.  This project will leverage and analyze long-term biological and physical datasets as they relate to drought and extreme storm events to improve our understanding of how these events impact habitat persistence and resilience into the future. Specifically, this project will look at storms and warm ocean temperatures related to El Ni\u00f1o and the 2016 and 2017 Atmospheric River storms which resulted in record breaking floods throughout California. In addition this project will investigate how drought conditions since 2012 changed the function of the coastal wetland system. The project has 3 main objectives: (1) assess data on weather, water levels, salinity, and water quality to examine drought and storm conditions in estuaries; (2) examine the relationship between physical and wetland biological data; and (3) develop a systems model to help inform how tidal wetland processes are impacted during these types of climatic events, a key management question identified by resource managers.

To remedy this serious knowledge gap, project researchers are examining the causes, effects, and forecastability of snow drought to provide needed scientific information and guidance to planners and decision makers.   The central goals of this proposal are to better quantify the impact of snow droughts on municipal and ecosystem water supplies and improve the scientific information accessible to a wide range of resource managers.

Researchers modeled anticipated changes in fish habitat using downscaled global climate change models to predict alterations of water temperature, hydrology, and land-use under different possible scenarios. This project worked closely with the existing partnership-driven National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHAP) to link global climate change models and predicted land-use changes to the Nation\u2019s aquatic habitats. The effects of climate change on fish and fish habitat was conducted at three spatial scales. First, a coarse-scale nationwide assessment of how habitat will change with climate was conducted. Second, we used data specific to selected U.S. regions to refine our predicted changes in fish habitat among varying climate and land-use patterns in the Desert Southwest, the Rocky Mountain West, the Northern Glacial Lakes, and the Northeast U.S., and different aquatic systems such as warmwater rivers, glacial lakes, and coldwater streams. Finally, we also determined how selected fish distributions may change with altered climate. For example, the coldwater habitat needed for cisco in lakes in the Upper Midwest is diminishing and may affect the distribution of this critical species. We provided state and federal agencies, non-government organizations, and other stakeholders with GIS-based maps at national and regional scales, showing how habitat will change with climate and land-use change, and information on how those changes affect fish populations. A final report synthesizing this large effort was produced and distributed to all interested stakeholders, in addition to peer-reviewed publications for the scientific community. Lastly, the project trained five PhD students and post doctoral researchers so that these students can continue in their professional careers, helping resource managers deal with the effects of climate change. The project leveraged over $1 million in current partnership-driven nationwide and regional fish habitat assessments through the 300-member NFHAP.

The goal of this project is to identify how winter severity, snowpack, and lake ice could change through the mid- and late-21st century, and how species such as the white-tailed deer and mallard duck will respond. Because currently available climate data is at too coarse a scale to provide information on future conditions for the Great Lakes, researchers transformed these models from a global-scale to a regional-scale.    Using these models, researchers found that the region could experience substantial warming, reduced lake ice cover, and increased precipitation, with more precipitation falling as rain than snow, among other changes. Snow/ice cover limit foraging by waterfowl, thereby regulating the timing/intensity of migration and their distributions during non-breeding season. Reductions in weather severity could result in delayed autumn-winter migration for dabbling ducks, which would increase foraging pressures on wetlands in the Great Lakes region \u2013 highlighting the importance of protecting these wetlands. These changes in migration patterns could also lead to potentially significant economic losses in southern flyway states, as ducks may stay in the Great Lakes region during the winter months. The primary wintertime stressors for deer are air chill and snow depth, with extreme winters triggering population declines.  Changes in wildlife abundance and distribution can incur dramatic ecological, societal, and economic impacts.

Previous conservation planning efforts identified and prioritized areas for conservation based on the current environmental conditions, such as habitat quality, and assumed that conditions in conservation lands would be largely controlled by management actions (including no action). Climate change, however, will likely alter important system drivers (temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise) and make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain recent historic conditions in conservation lands into the future. Climate change will also influence the future conservation potential of non-conservation lands, further complicating conservation planning. Therefore, there is a need to develop and adapt effective conservation strategies to cope with the effects of climate and landscape change on future environmental conditions.  Traditional urban growth models are very localized and data-intensive and lack the capability to be applied across large regions. In response to these limitations the North Carolina Cooperative Research Unit began using the USGS SLEUTH urban growth model to develop urbanization scenarios as part of the Southeast Regional Assessment Project (SERAP). Extensive modifications of the model framework and calibration were undertaken that resulted in the ability to rapidly develop urbanization scenarios for very large regions, such as the Appalachian, Caribbean, and Gulf Coastal Plain Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). This new modeling effort allows LCC\u2019s to address fundamental questions that affect conservation planning over decadal time scales.

Through this project, scientists sought to better understand how native and non-native forests in Hawai\u02bbi will respond to climate change. Researchers used field data from two long-term monitoring sites in Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park to model the effects of projected climate change on two forest ecosystems, one dominated by the native \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba tree and the other by the invasive strawberry guava tree.

These water-limited, highly-managed ecosystems have already been degraded by wildfires, the expansion of invasive grasses, and livestock grazing, and are expected to experience additional stress as climate and land use conditions change. Effective management of sagebrush ecosystems in the future will require the ability to understand and predict these future changes.   To address this need, researchers will identify historical rates and causes of vegetation change in shrubland ecosystems, then use this information to develop potential future climate and land use scenarios for three federally-managed lands in the region \u2013 Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge (USFWS), Beaty Butte Herd Management Area (BLM), and Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge (USFWS). Located near the Oregon-Nevada border, these units have a unique land use history and differing management practices. Through interagency partnerships, researchers will merge USGS land cover and fire data; USFWS and BLM data on grazing allotments, feral horse populations, and land treatments; and historical temperature and precipitation records to characterize the rates and causes of vegetation change. Once these relationships have been established, researchers will project future changes in vegetation within these three units through 2050. Maps will be produced that show where change may occur, where vegetation is more likely to degrade under continued stress, and where vegetation may recover more quickly.   BLM and USFWS managers can use this information to understand how critical vegetation types such as sagebrush might change over time, and what these changes will mean for species that depend on sagebrush for habitat. By presenting the impacts of climate and land use change on vegetation, land managers can customize adaptation plans to meet mission specific criteria including vegetation rehabilitation and habitat conservation.

In many parts of the world, this decrease in temperature is a limiting factor for vegetation\u2014at certain elevations, the temperature becomes too cold for plants to survive. However in the tropics, moisture availability may play a more important role than temperature in determining the altitude at which forests can grow. For example on Haleakal\u0101, a volcano on the Hawaiian Island of Maui, the forest line is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. Rather, the forest line is highest in the wetter eastern-most end and lower on the drier, western end of the volcano.   Research also suggests that short-duration extreme climate events that cause changes in moisture, such as El Ni\u00f1o, can control the upper limit of forests more than long-term average climate does. This is because species found at the forest line are often already near their physiological limits, so extreme changes can have a big effect on their survival.    A strong El Ni\u00f1o occurred in Hawai\u2019i in 2015 and provided researchers with a unique opportunity to observe how vegetation responds to ensuing climate variability.

The Gulf of Maine population began to decline significantly by the late 19th century, leading to the closure of the commercial Atlantic salmon fishery in 1948. In recent years, populations have again begun to decrease again. State and federal fisheries biologists are concerned that climate-related changes in streamflow and temperature could impact salmon survival in these rivers. Projections of future climate conditions for the Northeast indicate warming air temperatures, earlier snowmelt runoff, and decreases in streamflow during the low flow period (summer). In the spring, snow melts in the Northeast and recharges groundwater supplies. As climate conditions change, snow is melting earlier, resulting in longer periods of low streamflow in summer. These changes are of concern because this period is critical in the Atlantic salmon life cycle.   The goal of this project was to investigate changes in summer low streamflow and stream temperatures to identify how endangered Atlantic salmon populations might be affected by these changes. Researchers assessed past changes in groundwater discharge to rivers in the Gulf of Maine using historical flow data and estimated future streamflow, temperature, and groundwater discharge during summer low-flow periods using climate-model data and detailed watershed models.   A main result of this work was the development of a watershed model for four rivers in Maine that provide important habitat for Atlantic salmon: The Pleasant, Narraguagus, Sheepscot, and Royal Rivers. Researchers developed models of these river basins that provide daily streamflow, which enables managers to characterize the timing and quantity of water moving through each basin. This information can then be used to test how different streamflow and water temperature conditions might impact salmon.   This research expands our knowledge of the effects of climate-related changes on Atlantic Salmon, and can help managers make more informed decisions on the management of these ecosystems, given projected future changes in climate.", "casc": "National CASC"}, "5b368253e4b040769c1755ea": {"size": 71352, "title": "Improving Forecasts of Glacier Outburst Flood Events", "fy": "2018", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b368253e4b040769c1755ea", "summary": "Suicide Basin is a glacier-fed lake that branches off Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau, Alaska. Since 2011, Suicide Basin has been collecting melt- and rainwater each summer, creating a temporary glacier-dammed lake. Water that accumulates typically gets released through channels that run beneath the glacier. These channels are normally blocked by ice, but if the water pressure gets too high the channel breaks open, rapidly draining the basin in what is known as an \u201coutburst flood\u201d. In past years, these events have led to flooding along Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River in the most heavily populated neighborhood of Juneau.   Because of the threats posed to infrastructure in the Mendenhall Valley, it is critical that scientists closely monitor and forecast outburst flood events. The goal of this project is to design a tool to improve forecasting of the timing and flood peak associated with outburst events from Suicide Basin. The forecasting tool will be web-interfaced and provide real-time monitoring data from a USGS streamflow gage in Suicide Basin. After the onset of an outburst flood event, the web tool will also provide continuously updated forecasts of the flood peak (including timing) that will be used by the National Weather Service and the City and Borough of Juneau to warn the public about closures and threats to life and property.

Using the Upper Colorado River DEWS as a case study, this study investigated how water, land, and fire managers select from among many available tools.  The Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) was one of the first pilot areas, beginning in 2009, for implementation of a regional drought early warning system (DEWS) under the NIDIS program, which now supports eight regional DEWS. (In 2016, the UCRB DEWS was expanded and reconfigured into the Intermountain West DEWS). The selection of the UCRB for a pilot DEWS reflects the regional importance of drought monitoring for managing water supply for agriculture and other uses, and the need for effective decision support related to drought. New drought-information tools were developed specifically for the UCRB DEWS, and a number of others have been created since 2009, adding to the pre-existing toolkit for drought decision making. The various tools that are now available in the Upper Colorado River Basin region can be expected to be more or less suitable for different decision makers\u2019 needs. As a result, the broad decision context of this case study (managing drought) was fixed, but the information needs of users varied. This provided the opportunity to examine the varied choices decision makers make about which of the available tools to use or not use.  The research identified four broad categories of tool use that map to particular decision contexts. Water supply managers, land managers with rangeland management responsibilities, land managers focused on ecological health, and fire managers each use a suite of indicators and tools that match their particular decision context and timeframe at which they make decisions. Important differences also emerged in how respondents find out about tools, with water managers reporting strong inter-agency connections while land managers tend to rely on information from others within their agencies.

In order for the state to adequately prepare for and adapt to changing conditions, high-resolution climate data is needed.   One solution for acquiring this data is to use dynamical downscaling, a technique in which higher resolution weather forecasting models are used to provide local context to global-scale data. As part of this project, researchers have applied dynamical downscaling to ERA-Interim global atmospheric data for the years 1979-2015, and to two future climate model projections derived from the CMIP5 RCP8.5 scenario for the years 1970-2100. These data provide hourly information at 20 km resolution for all of Alaska and feature more than 30 meteorological variables, including temperature, precipitation (rain vs. snow), winds, and humidity.

The downscaled ERA-Interim data can be used by stakeholders to investigate climate- and weather-related phenomena in Alaska.

Currently, scientists and resource managers often find it difficult to use downscaled climate projections because of the multiple methodologies used to produce them and the time-consuming process required to obtain model output. In response, the research team implemented a three-part plan to provide high resolution climate data for the impact modeling community. First, a database was developed of up-to-date and state-of-the-art downscaled climate projections for the U.S., using a range of plausible future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Second, a series of workshops were held to solicit input about climate-related data needs and to discuss best practices for accessing and using downscaled climate projections. Finally, downscaled projections were made available as an enterprise-level web-based source. Users are able to freely access the data via an interactive, easily manageable interface, in formats which are familiar to ecosystem and impact modelers.

Factors such as low heat energy, short growing seasons, and cold winters prevent the survival of many crops. While considerable research has gone into assessing how to overcome some of these limitations, results suggest that climate change is already altering the equation, and will likely continue to do so. Some research suggests crop production for some varieties might advance northward in the state, leading to increases in yields and new varieties becoming viable. However, it\u2019s also projected that water stress may become an increasing challenge facing farmers. Further, some crops, such as the burgeoning peony market, are dependent on Alaska\u2019s cool climate and late summer season, and could be negatively impacted by warming temperatures.   Currently available tools are limited in their ability to help Alaska\u2019s farmers adjust to climate change, because they primarily focus on the effects of extreme winter temperatures. However, additional variables, such as day length, thaw dates, freeze dates, growing season length, and occurrence of extreme heat may all affect whether a particular crop can be grown in a particular location. To better support Alaska\u2019s small-scale growers, researchers will work with local farmers to first identify their immediate and long-term needs in relation to ongoing and potential future climate-related changes to crops. Next, researchers will develop fine-scale maps, tools, and datasets that meet these stakeholder-defined needs.

These trees currently face multiple threats, including attack by the mountain pine beetle, which has recently killed whitebark pines over much of the western U.S. Climate is an important factor in these outbreaks, and future warming is expected to affect epidemics. Our project developed statistical models of outbreaks in whitebark pine for three regions: the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Northern U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the Cascade Range. We used these models to understand climate/beetle outbreak relationships, evaluate climatic causes of recent outbreaks, and estimate the potential for future outbreaks given projections of climate change. The models fit the observations well, indicating confidence in their reliability. Climate influenced mountain pine beetle outbreaks through fall and winter temperatures, which are direct effects on beetles, as well as via reduced summer precipitation which increases drought stress on trees. Recent outbreaks were caused by warming and drought in the early 2000s. We found that, compared with a baseline of 1985-1994 when little beetle activity occurred, future climate will be more favorable for mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, our preliminary results indicate that some projections were similar to or exceed the climate favorability of conditions during the recent severe and extensive outbreak (2000-2009). Variability existed among outbreak projections as a result of the amount of future warming and changes in precipitation, which are functions of climate model, emissions scenario, and decade. Our project provides evidence of the importance of climate for influencing recent and future beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine forests. We recommend that land managers and decision makers consider the impacts of expected climate change on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine when planning conservation actions.

Therefore, sea-level rise and the associated changes in coastlines challenge both human communities and ecosystems.  Understanding which coastal lands will be vulnerable to sea-level rise is critical for policy makers, land-use planners, and coastal residents. Focusing on the coastal region from Virginia to Maine, researchers examined a range of different possible sea-level rise scenarios, combined with information on features of the coastal landscape (such as elevation and land cover type), to forecast which coastal areas would likely flood, and which would likely change or move as a result of sea-level rise. Researchers found that 70 percent of the Northeast U.S. Atlantic Coast has the capacity to change over the next several decades in response to rising seas.  Knowing where coastal habitats are likely to be resilient, where they will likely change, and where they might flood as a result of sea-level rise is essential for developing management and resource allocation strategies that preserve coastal areas.

In addition to having negative social and economic implications, long periods without rainfall can alter ecosystems, thereby threatening fish and wildlife species.   The term \u201cecological drought\u201d emphasizes the environmental consequences of future droughts. While it is known that ecological drought places multiple stresses on the environment, many of the specific impacts are not fully understood. To address this need, researchers are working to synthesize knowledge on the impacts of ecological drought across the country and to develop tools and products that are useful for decision making.   A series of eight workshops aimed at synthesizing our existing knowledge of the ecological impacts of drought are planned for each of the eight Department of Interior Climate Science Centers. These workshops will culminate in a national synthesis describing the state of our knowledge of ecological drought. Additionally, a group of scientists from the University of Maryland\u2019s Integration and Application Network (IAN) \u2013 a group specializing in science communication \u2013 will develop related communication products that effectively deliver the results to stakeholders.   These regional drought syntheses represent a significant step towards addressing the challenges mangers face in coping with the impacts of drought.

The project researchers have developed a framework for the evaluation of collaboratively produced climate science that specifically addresses the process of producing and outcomes of actionable science. Through this project, the team is using this framework to evaluate a sample of projects funded by the Southwest CSC to determine: 1) To what extent the science is being applied to management decisions in the Southwest region, 2) What the barriers are to the use of science, and 3) Which practices or strategies are most associated with the production of actionable science.

We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming in as much as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100. We were able to develop good predictive models of how warming influences beneficial and pest insects for cities in the Southeast and across the east coast more generally. We were also able to predict how tree health will respond to these changes in insect communities. In addition, by comparing our results to those we garnered from herbarium specimens (many insects can be found on herbarium specimens) we could show that the effects of urban warming match those of climate change through time. In short, a subset of pests is likely to get far worse with warming and this effect is likely to be most pronounced in the southeast.

Although some variability in fish catches is expected across factors such as location and season, we know less about how large-scale disturbances like climate change will influence population variability.  The Laurentian Great Lakes in North America are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world, and they have experienced major changes due to fluctuations in pollution and nutrient loadings, exploitation of natural resources, introductions of non-native species, and shifting climatic patterns.  In this project, we analyzed established long-term data about important fish populations from across the Great Lakes basin, including from Oneida Lake in NY, Lake Michigan, and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Our objective was to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in fish catches from large freshwater lakes that have experienced large-scale changing conditions.  We evaluated analytical approaches with the potential to disentangle sources of variability in standardized monitoring data.  Specifically, we considered 1) how the decomposition of spatial and temporal variation in fish catches can be used to measure a response to perturbation; 2) how truncation of population age structure can alter population oscillations which may shift how a population is affected by environmental fluctuations; and 3) how the composition of a fish community may respond to a suite of environmental drivers through time. Using long-term gill-net data for walleye, we found that average catch and variance structure differed before and after large-scale perturbations.

Questions remain, however, regarding the most effective and efficient methods for extending scientific knowledge and products into management and decision-making.  This study analyzes two unique cases of water management to better understand how science can be translated into resource management actions and decision-making.  In particular, this project seeks to understand 1) the characteristics that make science actionable and useful for water resource management and drought preparedness, and 2) the ideal types of scientific knowledge or science products that facilitate the use of science in management and decision-making.  The first case study focuses on beaver mimicry, an emerging nature-based solution that increases the presence of wood and woody debris in rivers and streams to mimic the actions of beavers. This technique has been rapidly adopted by natural resource managers as a way to restore riparian areas, increase groundwater infiltration, and slow surface water flow so that more water is available later in the year during hotter and dryer months. The second case study focuses on an established research program, Colorado Dust on Snow, that provides water managers with scientific information explaining how the movement of dust particles from the Colorado Plateau influences hydrology and the timing and intensity of snow melt and water runoff into critical water sources. This program has support from and is being used by several water conservation districts in the state.  Understanding how scientific knowledge translates into action and decision-making in these cases will strengthen our knowledge of actionable science in the context of drought and its impacts on ecosystems.

Hydrologic models can be used to provide estimates of streamflow in the absence of streamflow information. These models depend upon available streamflow data for calibration, and can be very inaccurate without the use of those data. This research developed a method to group watersheds that are gaged with watersheds that are not gaged so that accurate estimates of water availability can be provided regionally. To accomplish this, various models, techniques, and data were used to group watersheds across the southeastern United States. This means that watersheds were not necessarily grouped by proximity to one another, but instead were grouped based on their response to climate and their landscape setting.

Maintaining healthy herds not only supports the ecosystems where these species are found, but also the hunting and wildlife watching communities. For example, in Wyoming, big game hunting contributed over $300 million to the state\u2019s economy in 2015. Yet as climate conditions change, the quantity, quality, and timing of vegetation available to mule deer, elk, and other ungulates, known as forage, could shift. It\u2019s possible that these changes could have cascading impacts on the behavior and population sizes of many species.  A key strategy used by managers to improve forage availability and adapt to change is the implementation of habitat treatments. These treatments include prescribed fire, forest thinning, and removal of invasive weeds, and are currently being planned to counteract the expected decline in mule deer habitat in the Kemmerer-Cokeville Area of southwestern Wyoming. To ensure that these activities are effective in meeting their goals, it is important for managers to have information on how forage conditions are already changing due to climate variability, and what any potential tradeoffs associated with these techniques may be.  Focusing on Montana and Wyoming, this project aims to meet this need by achieving three objectives. First, researchers will prepare summaries of past and future changes in forage by watershed, herd, and hunting area for both states. These summaries will help managers prioritize areas for management by providing baseline information about the direction, degree, and certainty of change in the quality and timing of forage. Second, researchers will assess changes in forage conditions in aspen, sagebrush, and mixed mountain shrub habitat in southwest Wyoming. They will develop maps of future forage based on scenarios that reflect probabilities of important weather patterns (such as drought), the current distribution of invasive cheatgrass (which decreases forage quality), and expected effects of planned habitat treatments, such as prescribed fire. Lastly, researchers will use these maps to evaluate the effects of treatment options on mule deer migration, fawning, and summer habitat, and on elk calving, migration, and habitat use.

Over the past century, however, populations have dramatically declined due to habitat loss, overharvest, and invasive species. Consequently, many populations are listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Complicating these stressors is global warming and associated climate change. Overall, aquatic ecosystems across the PNW are predicted to experience increasingly earlier snowmelt in the spring, reduced late spring and summer flows, increased winter flooding, warmer and drier summers, increased water temperatures, and expansion of invasive species. Understanding how effects of climate change might influence habitat for native salmonid populations is critical for effective management and recovery of these species. Scientists at the USGS and University of Montana used novel techniques and empirical data to study how climate change may drive landscape scale impacts that affect freshwater habitats and populations of key salmonid species (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and steelhead) throughout the PNW. Results showed strong linkages between climatic drivers (temperature and flow regimes) and the distribution, abundance, and genetic diversity of native salmonids across the PNW. Specifically, warming temperatures and shifting flow regimes are expected to fragment stream systems and cause salmonids to retreat upstream to headwater areas, thereby decreasing fish population abundance and genetic diversity, both of which are critical for persistence in a changing landscape. Climate-change\u2010induced periods of decreasing spring snowmelt and increases in stream temperatures are likely to decrease native biodiversity by fostering cross-breeding between invasive and native trout species. The study also developed a new framework for assessing the vulnerability of freshwater species to climate change and other stressors in complex stream networks, which will aid managers in proactively implementing conservation programs to increase resiliency and adaptive capacity of aquatic species.

For example, because climate change may alter the frequency, duration, or severity of droughts, small habitats that naturally retain water (drought refugia) may become increasingly important to many natural wildlife communities.  Although several approaches have been suggested for identifying climate refugia, large-scale mapping and evaluation of refugia have not yet been conducted in the Pacific Northwest. To address this information gap, researchers used existing information on hydrology, soil characteristics, topography etc. to map areas of refugia that can protect wildlife from regional changes in temperature and precipitation.

The two essential components of the process are FRAME (Framing Research in support of the Adaptive Management of Ecosystems), which creates a collaborative problem-solving environment, and SIMPPLLE (SIMulating Patterns and Processes at Landscape Scales), which is a vegetation dynamics modeling system. The resulting collaborative modeling process allows decision makers to optimize the management of multiple resources and evaluate the likely outcome of various choices.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. As part of this project, researchers identified important thresholds for ecosystem changes and highlighted coastal areas in the southeastern U.S. (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, and parts of Florida) where relatively small changes in winter conditions could cause relatively dramatic changes in coastal wetlands. Results indicate that mangrove forest expansion will bring about both above- and below-ground ecosystem changes. The most striking and apparent changes will occur above ground as forests develop and replace grasslands. These above-ground transformations will increase carbon storage and affect certain societal benefits provided by coastal wetlands in the region. The below-ground changes due to mangrove expansion will be more subtle and dependent upon the marsh that is being replaced.

CASC-funded researchers have previously proposed a cohort of 45 indicators for evaluating the co-production of climate knowledge by conducting a review of the academic literature, examining metrics used by other agencies to evaluate usable science, and compiling insights from experienced researchers and managers. While this research has resulted in a rich set of data, constraints on resources, such as time and funding, have limited the team to working with a small sample of case study projects from the Southwest and Northwest CASCs.   This project will address the issue of scalability in evaluation, both in terms of number of projects evaluated and number of stakeholders targeted. An evaluation approach that encompasses a center\u2019s full portfolio of projects will better enable the intercomparison of funding choices and co-production approaches. This evaluation will focus on completed projects from the North Central and South Central CASCs.

Warming temperatures, clearly documented in climate records for the Colorado River basin, are having an impact on the amount of annual streamflow yielded from rain and snow. Recent work has revealed that warming temperatures have played an increasingly important role over the past decades, both exacerbating droughts and dampening the effects of wet winters on high stream flows. Understanding and anticipating how warming temperatures will influence future water supply in the Colorado River basin is increasingly important for resource management, particularly in light of recent drought conditions.   The overarching goals of this project are to better understand the influence of temperature on Colorado River streamflow, particularly during droughts, and assist water managers in planning for future droughts. This work expands on a recently completed study, building on that project in two main ways. First, this project extends collaborative work between scientists and Colorado River basin water managers to investigate the range of potential drought conditions under early 21st century warming, using both recent and historical data. For example, with precipitation reconstructions from tree rings for the past 500 years, the team can use a simple hydrologic model to assess the impacts of the longest and most severe droughts of the past on the Colorado River under today\u2019s warmer temperatures. With this information, the project team will contribute to a set of plausible scenarios of future drought that planners can use to help make resource-management decisions. Second, the project is more explicitly examining the drivers of Colorado River drought, with a focus on factors such as the phase of precipitation (rain vs. snow), the timing and rate of snowmelt, and evaporation rates.

The impacts of these climate-induced shifts in forest composition on air quality, particularly VOC emissions and subsequent ozone and aerosol formation, is little understood. This project aims to explore the relative contribution of shifts in approximately 25 tree species to changes in the VOC, ozone, and aerosol environment using a suite of high-resolution models.  This science can help land managers understand the natural precursors to ozone and aerosols that are expected for their management zone and can inform decisions about air quality in a changing climate.

A key advantage of the hierarchical approach is that it incorporates various sources of observations and includes established scientific knowledge, and uncertainties associated with each. This work is critical for monitoring effects of climate change since lakes and streams have been identified as sentinels of environmental change. The proposed hierarchical modeling approach should help to account for these uncertainties, in particular variability of relevant climate conditions across temporal and spatial scales, so forecasts of community or population response to a given climate change scenario include realistic measures of uncertainty.

We focused on five species of mammals in the alpine zone of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, including the federally endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep and the American pika, a species recently proposed for listing due to the loss of populations from altered climatic conditions. It is expected that there will be an upward expansion of trees and shrubs from lower elevations and that many or even most alpine meadows will be converted to woody dominated communities. Meadows provide critical habitat for many alpine mammal species, and their conversion could represent a major loss with severe consequences for the long-term persistence of these species. However, it is currently unknown whether the severity of the effects of meadow conversion on alpine mammals would be uniform or species-specific; all species could be impacted similarly; some species could be unaffected; or species currently not considered at risk may be seriously impacted. Moreover, while climate could potentially trigger changes in alpine vegetation communities, herbivorous and granivorous mammals could mediate the magnitude and extent of meadow conversion through their consumption of woody seeds and seedlings.

Every spring, hundreds of birds migrate to their summer breeding grounds in Alaska and northern Canada. Their arrival is timed with the height of the spring green-up of plants, which provide the food necessary for birds to reproduce and raise their young. However, over the last fifty years, warming temperatures in Alaska as a result of climate change have prompted an earlier transition from winter to spring. The purpose of this project was to examine whether there have been changes in the timing of spring green-up in recent years (1985-2009) and, if so, whether migratory birds are adapting their migration schedules accordingly.    Researchers used historical satellite imagery and long-term records on bird migration and breeding from across Alaska to generate a series of maps and publications to answer these questions. They found that bird species ranged widely in their adaptation to earlier spring, with some doing better than others at timing their arrival with changing temperature. The researchers also used downscaled climate models to project how bird habitat will be affected by climate change through the 21st century. This information can be used by Alaska land managers to focus their conservation efforts on species or habitat areas that appear especially vulnerable.

In western Montana for example, snowshoe hare make up 96% of lynx diet. In fact, hares are critical players in forest ecosystems because most carnivores prey on them.   The main way that snowshoe hares escape predation is through camouflage. In response to changes in day length, snowshoe hares molt seasonally, changing color from brown to white in the winter to blend in with the snowfall and hide from predators. However, due to shorter snow seasons caused by recent changes in climate, snowshoe hares are turning white before it snows, making them more visible to predators. Because 21 other species around the world also undergo these seasonal coat color changes, snowshoe hares also represent a window to understand climate change effects on wild animals.   The goal of this project was to investigate the causes and consequences of climate change induced color mismatch in snowshoe hares, focusing on populations in the Seeley-Swan valley and Gallatin National Forest in Montana. With the cooperation of multiple partners, including the University of Montana, the National Science Foundation, NASA, the National Park Service, Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and the U.S. Forest Service, this research combined field data with climate projections to directly evaluate how well wild animals might be able to adapt and persist in the face of climate change.    Results of this project show that snowshoe hares do not have much ability to adapt through behaviors such as hiding or fleeing more readily when they are white and mismatched against a brown snowless background. Also, they cannot readily adjust their color molt to track shorter snow seasons. Mismatched white animals on snowless ground were found to have a 7% higher chance of being killed each week by predators than color matched animals.   These results mean that without evolutionary changes, wild hares are highly likely to experience severe population declines by the end of the century. However, such declines are not inevitable, as the researchers note tangible ways that land managers could increase wildlife resilience to climate change by fostering \u2018evolutionary rescue\u2019 to climate change. In short, this project both provides specific information on snowshoe hares to wildlife managers, and also provides a novel way to foster resilience to climate change through evolutionary change.

Not only has this translated into a longer fire season, but reduced snowpack has cascading effects that impact streamflow, water supplies, agricultural productivity, and ecosystems. California receives 80% of its precipitation during the winter, so mountain snowpack plays a critical role in replenishing the state\u2019s water supply.   One factor that affects the amount of winter precipitation (and therefore snowpack) in California is the North Pacific Jet (NPJ)\u2014a current of strong, high altitude winds that occur over the northern Pacific Ocean. Winters when the NPJ is located further north than normal are drier than average in California, while winters when the NPJ is located further south are wetter. Climate change is expected to cause the position of the NPJ to become more variable, which could greatly influence California\u2019s water resources and ecosystems.   The goal of this project is to identify the relationship between the NPJ and wildfires in California. Researchers will first use tree-ring data to examine variability in the position of the NPJ over the past 400+ years to identify historical trends. They will then use historical fire data to determine how the NPJ has influenced wildfire patterns in the past. Finally, researchers will look at recent fire data to see if this historical relationship between the NPJ and fire holds true in the 21 st century.   By documenting the relationship between the NPJ and wildfires, this project will enable fire managers to better forecast future fire conditions, based on projected trends in the NPJ. Improving forecasting ability is critical to successful fire preparedness and accurate anticipation of fire suppression budgets.

Coastal habitats also provide protective ecosystem services to human communities, which are increasingly at risk to storms and sea level rise under future climate change. Understanding how climate change will impact natural and human communities is a crucial part of decision making and management related to the protection of our coasts.   In a collaborative project between the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NA LCC) and the Northeast Climate Science Center, researchers compiled existing threshold information on priority coastal fish, wildlife, and plant species as well as coastal habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and Caribbean in response to sea level rise and storm projections. As the effects of climate change on ecological and human communities grow, the possibility of crossing tipping points or thresholds of viability increases the potential for rapid and possibly irreversible changes in ecosystems. Therefore, understanding thresholds related to climate change is critical for facilitating conservation and management actions, which could help to prevent more costly and possibly catastrophic effects in the near (years to decades) and distant (decades to centuries) future. The compilation of this information will help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how natural systems will respond to climate change and how land and resource management decisions could potentially help these species.     Researchers further compiled natural and nature-based approaches to restoration and management that benefit both natural and human communities in the coastal zone, as well as synthesized information on the suite of ecosystem services provided by tidal marshes, beaches and barrier islands, mangroves, and shellfish beds. This work will inform climate change adaptation and resilience planning and assist coastal communities that must weigh important tradeoffs regarding the benefits and drawbacks of green and grey coastal infrastructure.

These extremes can affect the availability of food and water needed by wildlife. Wildlife management agencies and conservation organizations need information on resource availability for wildlife under future climate scenarios to design effective management strategies to sustain wildlife populations.

Although heat stress from increasing temperatures could be a potential factor for declining populations in Minnesota, temperature increases have also occurred in New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut where populations have been expanding in recent years. Alternatively, indirect climate effects from warmer temperatures may be playing a role, such as increased prevalence of parasites (e.g., brainworm, winter tick) to levels lethal to moose. Additionally, factors such as predation, differences in habitat, and fitness are being considered. Genomics has the potential to complement ongoing research by providing unique approaches to explore moose responses to stress through the examination of molecular differences in heat tolerance, immune response, or fitness in general. This project is utilizing such genomic techniques to study the responses of moose to environmental stressors throughout the southern periphery of their range in the U.S. Northeast, Midwest (Minnesota and Michigan), and Rocky Mountains. Because populations from those regions represent three subspecies, it is important to first understand population relatedness and any genetic variances through a genome scan. Secondarily, we will investigate actively expressed genes and cellular function, which may provide information on variation in immune responses to local stressors. Ultimately, we will look for genes that may be under selection, which could represent local adaptations to environmental conditions.

These invasions often cause management agencies to incur high costs for prevention, control, restoration, and fire responses.   Control and prevention of invasive species is challenging because the risk of invasive plants becoming abundant depends on existing plant communities, climate and weather, land use, and fire history. Moreover, scientific information on invasion risk that does exist has not always been translated into maps that planners and resource managers can use in their decision making. Broad-scale information is needed to link geographic variation in climate and disturbances (e.g. fire) to decisions on the ground regarding where to apply treatments aimed at limiting the impacts of invasions and restoring native plant composition.   This project aims to use existing datasets to understand the links between the abundance of major plant invaders and climatic extremes, land use and fire history.

We sought insights by examining Lake Erie as a representative system with a high level of anthropogenic impacts, strong nutrient gradients, seasonal hypoxia, and spatial overlap of cold- and cool-water fish guilds. In Lake Erie and in large embayments throughout the Great Lakes basin, this situation is a concern for fishery managers, as climate change may exacerbate hypoxia and reduce habitat volume for some species. We examined fish community composition, fine-scale distribution, prey availability, diets, and biochemical tracers for dominant fishes from study areas with medium-high nutrient levels (mesotrophic, Fairport study area), and low nutrient levels (oligotrophic, Erie study area). This multi-year database (2011-2013) provides the ability to contrast years with wide variation in rainfall, winter ice-cover, and thermal stratification. In addition, multiple indicators of dietary and distributional responses to environmental variability will allow resource managers to select the most informative approach for addressing specific climate change questions.  Our results support the incorporation of some relatively simple and cost-efficient approaches into existing agency monitoring programs to track the near-term condition status of fish and fish community composition by functional groupings. Other metrics appear better suited for understanding longer-term changes, and may take more resources to implement on an ongoing basis. Although we hypothesized that dietary overlap and similarity in selected species would be sharply different during thermal stratification and hypoxic episodes, we found little evidence of this. Instead, to our surprise, this study found that fish tended to aggregate at the edges of hypoxia, highlighting potential spatial changes in catch efficiency of the fishery.  This work has had several positive impacts on a wide range of resource management and stakeholder activities, most notably in Lake Erie. The results were instrumental in the development of an interim decision rule for dealing with data collected during hypoxic events to improve stock assessment of Yellow Perch.

The workshop was used to discuss the results of this survey, assess other stream temperature efforts for application in Alaska, and explore best data management practices to ensure long term sustainability of stream temperature data.   The 2015 workshop helped to establish that the stakeholders and science-users in Alaska need an assessment of existing websites that provide various components of data management for stream temperature. The project team is working on this assessment and is also developing a HUC-8 prioritization strategy for stream temperature data collection for the entire state of Alaska based on existing instrumentation and other relevant parameters. This project aims to investigate stakeholder preferences for data management for stakeholders interested in conducting regional analyses of stream temperature data.

Effective conservation of migratory birds depends on a clear understanding of how environmental factors affect key demographic rates (e.g., survival and reproduction). This informational need is especially pressing in the context of climate change. Climate change is expected to affect migratory bird habitat and populations in multiple ways, and a mechanistic understanding of how demographic rates are related to climate variables will help land and resource managers to better anticipate and manage these changes.  The Institute for Bird Populations (IBP) is addressing this question by using data from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program, the longest running continent-wide monitoring program to provide information on migratory bird demographics (recruitment, survival, immigration, and emigration). Data collected through MAPS is used to clarify the factors driving population declines; to determine priority areas to target for conservation and restoration; and to clarify relationships between demographic trends and environmental factors. IBP is also collaborating with researchers from the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center to develop a climate-informed integrated population model by combining MAPS data with additional data sources on climate variables, population trends, and occupancy data. This model will provide a clearer understanding of the factors that impact migratory bird populations and the ways that climate change is likely to affect species survival by clarifying relationships between climate variables and demographic parameters. Ultimately, this research will provide decision makers and the management community with a mechanistic understanding of how climate change may impact migratory bird population levels and ultimately species survival.

Bald eagles, an ecologically and culturally significant apex predator, congregate seasonally in high densities on salmon spawning rivers across the Pacific Northwest. One of the largest eagle concentrations is in the Skagit River watershed, which connects the montane wilderness of North Cascades National Park to the Puget Sound. Using multiple long-term datasets, we evaluated the relationship between local bald eagle abundance, chum and coho salmon availability and phenology, and the number and timing of flood events in the Skagit River. We analyzed both changes over time as a reflection of climate change impacts, as well as differences between managed and unmanaged portions of the river. We found that peaks in chum salmon and bald eagle presence have advanced at remarkably similar rates (~0.45 days/year), suggesting synchronous phenological responses within this trophic relationship.Yet the temporal relationship between chum salmon spawning and flood events, which remove salmon carcasses from the system, has not remained constant. This has resulted in a paradigm shift whereby the peak of chum spawning now occurs before the first flood event of the season rather than after. The interval between peak chum and first flood event was a significant predictor of bald eagle presence: as this interval grew over time (by nearly a day per year), bald eagle counts declined, with a steady decrease in bald eagle observations since 2002. River section was also an important factor, with fewer flood events and more eagle observations occurring in the river section experiencing direct hydroelectric flow management.", "casc": "National CASC"}, "5b3160b9e4b040769c13ffca": {"size": 22867, "title": "Improving the Success of Post-Fire Adaptive Management Strategies in Sagebrush Steppe", "fy": "2018", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b3160b9e4b040769c13ffca", "summary": "Sagebrush steppe is one of the most widely distributed ecosystems in North America. Found in eleven western states, this important yet fragile ecosystem is dominated by sagebrush, but also contains a diversity of native shrubs, grasses, and flowering plants. It provides critical habitat for wildlife like pronghorn and threatened species such as the greater sage-grouse, and is grazed by livestock on public and private lands. However, this landscape is increasingly threatened by shifts in wildfire patterns, the spread of invasive grasses, and changing climate conditions. While sagebrush is slow to recover after fires, non-native grasses such as cheatgrass thrive in post-fire conditions and the spread of these species can increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires. These changes to the sagebrush ecosystems have implications for big game, threatened wildlife, and ranching.  To address this growing concern, resource managers will often try to limit the spread of exotic grasses after fire events by applying herbicides, or will help native species recover through seeding or planting. However, these treatments have mixed results, and poor success is often attributed to droughts, which make it more difficult for seeds and native plants to survive; to the limited amount of time in which these treatments can be applied (usually in the first year after a fire); or because the seeds or plants used aren\u2019t adapted to the environmental conditions of the location where they\u2019re applied.  The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the factors that affect post-fire treatment success. Researchers will use data collected from more than 300 fires over the last 40 years, after which treatments were applied. They will identify the impacts of drought on those treatments, how incorporating information on drought forecasts or extending the period over which treatments are applied could have altered the outcomes, and how managers can better select plant material that will be more adaptable to the conditions of planting locations. Addressing this knowledge gap has been identified as a high priority in the DOI Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy, by the BLM Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation Program, and by state management agencies in the West.

This subspecies appears to be more vulnerable to drought than more northern subspecies, because it occupies small and fragmented streams which are at greater risk of drying up during drought. Most notably, in 2002 drought in the Southwest resulted in the loss of 14 different Rio Grande cutthroat trout populations \u2013 about 10% of the total population.   While it is known that drought is having an effect on Rio Grande cutthroat trout, the specific ways in which individuals and populations are affected by drought remains unclear. In light of worsening drought conditions in the Southwest, the need to identify the specific impacts of drought on the Rio Grande cutthroat trout is only increasing. This project is examining the effects of reduced stream flow and higher stream temperature on Rio Grande cutthroat trout to identify how factors such as the survival of individual fish and the growth rates of entire populations may be changing. Once these effects have been identified, researchers will model the long-term survival of the subspecies under predicted future drought conditions.   Although the Rio Grande cutthroat trout is not at immediate risk of extinction according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, more than half of the remaining populations are considered to be in fair or poor condition. The results of this research will directly inform managers as to the vulnerability of this species to drought and which actions can be taken to increase the survival of Rio Grande cutthroat trout during drought. The results will also be valuable for managers working to protect other southwestern trout species under a changing climate, such as the Gila trout and the Apache trout.

To measure air temperature at biologically relevant scales in the field, ecologists often use small, portable temperature sensors. These sensors must be shielded from solar radiation to provide accurate temperature measurements, but a review of 18 years of ecological literature indicated that shielding practices vary across studies (when the shielding is reported at all), and that ecologists often invent and construct ad-hoc radiation shields without testing their efficacy.  The project researchers performed two field experiments to examine the accuracy of temperature observations from three commonly used portable data loggers (HOBO Pro, HOBO Pendant, and iButton hygrochron) housed in manufactured Gill shields or ad-hoc, custom-fabricated shields constructed from everyday materials such as plastic cups. They installed replicates of this array of sensors (11 sensor-shield combinations) at 5 different sites at weather stations located in open and forested sites. The team found that HOBO Pro sensors with Gill shields were the most accurate devices. Error in ad-hoc shield treatments ranged from 0.8 to 3.0 \u00b0C, with the largest errors at the open site.  They also deployed one replicate of each sensor-shield combination at five sites that varied in the amount of urban impervious surface cover, which presents a further shielding challenge. Results showed that bias in the sensors with ad-hoc shields increased by up to 0.7 \u00b0C for every 10% increase in impervious surface.  This study shows that, due to variable shielding practices, the ecological literature likely includes highly biased temperature data that cannot be compared directly across studies.

Among land managers and tribes, there is a strong interest in preserving and restoring these culturally important plant species across the Pacific Northwest.  However, limited knowledge is available on the current ranges of shrub species, or how climate change will impact future ranges or the timing of flowering and fruiting for key Northwest shrub species.   The project team is partnering with several tribes and land management agencies to develop and package information on how climate change will impact where these plants can grow and the timing of flowering and fruit production of culturally important Northwestern shrubs. The team is first working with tribes to identify shrubs of significant cultural interest to focus on. They will then synthesize location and life history data from multiple inventory and scientific data sources to develop range maps and models for understanding past and future conditions for focal shrub species.

This information will help researchers determine if droughts are lasting longer or are more severe than historical droughts, improving our understanding of the impacts of climate change in the region.   So far, researchers have found that warming temperatures have played an increasingly important role over the past decades, both exacerbating droughts and dampening the effects of wet winters on high flows. The results of this study will help water managers assess the range of possible conditions that may be expected to occur in the future in the Colorado River basin, and help determine how warming temperatures may influence the river\u2019s flow and the region\u2019s water supply.

By locating these areas upfront, researchers can exclude them from their analysis and focus water supply forecasting efforts on areas where groundwater is more likely to be affected by changes in rainfall or human uses at the surface.   The model shows that areas with a shallower water table tend to have more variability in the rate at which groundwater supplies are replenished, with secondary effects related to the soil type and the period of variation. In these areas, changes in rainfall and water withdrawal for irrigation or urban use have a bigger impact on groundwater availability. Water resource managers can use this tool to more accurately forecast how much groundwater remains in different watersheds and to determine which systems will be most sensitive to changes in climate and water use.

While models can be used to predict the types of impacts that climate change might have on a landscape, uncertainty remains surrounding factors such as how quickly changes will occur and how specific resources will respond.   In order to plan for this uncertain future, managers have begun to use a tool known as scenario planning. In this approach, a subset of global climate model projections are selected that represent a range of plausible future climate scenarios for a particular area. Through a series of facilitated workshops, managers can then explore different management options under each scenario, enabling them to be proactive in the face of uncertainty. However, selecting and synthesizing climate information for scenario planning requires significant time and skills, and it can be difficult to predict exactly how resources might respond to a combination of climate, management actions, and other factors.   Therefore, the goals of this project are to develop a process for creating regional climate summaries that can also be used for local scenario planning, and to pilot an approach for enhancing scenario planning through simulation modeling. Researchers will draw on global climate model projections to develop several climate summaries for the northern Great Plains region. The summaries will then be used for local-scale climate adaptation planning efforts for Badlands National Park (South Dakota) and Knife River Indian Villages National Historical Site (North Dakota) and surrounding federal and tribal lands.

Hawaiian nearshore reefs generate about $800 million in annual revenue, not including the ecosystem services they provide - such as critical habitat for diverse fish species and buffering coasts from storm surges. The Hawaiian economy depends on healthy coral ecosystems, yet reefs are currently facing multiple threats, including changing climate conditions, local land-based pollution, and sediment erosion.  Erosion of soils into nearshore coastal zones is a chief concern facing land managers in West Maui. Intermittent rainfall can carry sediment from sources such as dirt roads, agricultural fields, streambanks, and disturbed forests into estuaries and the ocean. These sediments can block light that corals need for photosynthesis, essentially smothering them. Sediment also affects coastal user enjoyment by reducing water quality.  The goal of this project was to map, monitor, and analyze recent and historic rainfall to estimate sources of sediment for watersheds in West Maui. Researchers described how much sediment was entering the water from different land-based sources, to create a sediment budget for two watersheds in West Maui. Researchers found that current sediment deposition into coastal waters is likely due to the erosion of streambank terraces located downstream of former agricultural fields. These terraces are remnants of old agricultural land management practices in which soil and rock waste were pushed from fields into streams. It\u2019s estimated that this source results in over 90 dump truck loads of fine sediment entering West Maui\u2019s nearshore environment each year.

Managing these ecosystems into the future requires a better understanding of how climate, hydrology, and karst ecosystems interact.  The objective of this project was to determine how species and ecosystems associated with karst might respond to future temperature and precipitation extremes and accompanying changes in groundwater levels and springflow. The research focused on 16 species in the Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas and eight species in the Madison aquifer in western South Dakota. Researchers linked global climate models, regional climate models, and hydrologic models to determine how future springflow might be impacted by changes in temperature and precipitation. By combining information about future hydrology with what we know about species needs, researchers determined the vulnerability of the selected species to climate extremes.  Researchers found that more species in the Edwards aquifer are vulnerable to climate extremes than in the Madison aquifer, due in part to the more severe hydrologic changes that the Edwards aquifer is expected to undergo. This result suggests that including hydrologic factors critical to species health is essential in evaluating the vulnerability of karst ecosystems to climate extremes.

In this study, we compared the relative vulnerabilities to climate change of 76 species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and trees based on three different approaches to assessing vulnerability. We compared (1) projected shifts in species distributions to (2) an assessment based on expert opinion and projected changes in climate to (3) an approach based on the current and future climatic conditions within species\u2019 current ranges. We found that the three approaches provided substantially different rankings of the species. Some species were determined to be highly vulnerable by one approach but only moderately vulnerable by the other two approaches. Only one species, the caribou, was consistently ranked in the top ten most vulnerable species by all three approaches. This is not entirely surprising given that the three measures assess different aspects of vulnerability and are based on different types of information. Nonetheless, these results are important because they indicate that more than one approach may be needed to adequately assess vulnerability and that basing management decisions on one approach alone may lead scientists and managers to underestimate vulnerability.

These changes have implications for the phenology, or the timing of natural life events (e.g. the timing of plant flowering in Spring or leaves falling in Autumn), of many plant species. However, not all species and regions are changing at the same rate, which can lead to mismatches (e.g. between the emergence of plants and pollinators in early spring). Many interactions in nature depend on timing and, as such, phenology affects nearly all aspects of the environment, including the abundance, distribution, and diversity of organisms, ecosystem services, food webs, even global water and carbon cycles.   Phenology is among the best indicators of climate change impacts, in large part because phenological events are some of the most sensitive biological responses to environmental changes. Researchers are rapidly developing datasets, models, and indices that can improve our understanding of changing phenology. However, most indices of phenological change are poorly suited for water-limited ecosystems, and existing models are lacking in their ability to represent phenological change at local scales that are relevant and useful for decision making.   This project is a step towards addressing these limitations. The project team aims to use local phenology data and climate information to build new phenology indices and models for the southwestern U.S. that address several significant information gaps, with a specific focus on creating useful and relevant data products and decision-support tools for managers. These models will be used to evaluate variations in historical phenology trends based on time period, plant type, geography, and moisture availability. The team plans to generate a phenology tool that resource managers in the Southwest can use to predict phenology events (e.g. plant green-up) based on a specified climate (historical, future near-term, and long-term).

Results show that maintaining larger areas of cold water habitat had the greatest, positive impact on bull trout habitat conservation. Other conditions that support bull trout include very cold summer water temperatures, fewer winter floods, and fewer human disturbances (such as the building of dams). Based on these results, specific climate adaptation actions that local managers might consider include prioritizing land and water use to foster colder summer water temperatures, controlling invasive species, increasing connectivity between Bull Trout habitats, and continuing monitoring efforts.

Moreover, given the diversity in forest stakeholders across the Northeast region, it is unclear if the adaptation science needs for these stakeholders are fully captured by existing adaptation recommendations.   The overall goals of this project are to identify the adaptation science needs of federal, state, and tribal stakeholders of forest habitats and to determine the effectiveness of adaptation strategies at sustaining forest-dependent bird species across the region. Scientists will conduct interviews with these stakeholders to identify these key adaptation science needs and apply models of future forest conditions to evaluate how effective different forest management strategies will be at sustaining bird populations under future climate conditions. This project will identify key research gaps related to forest adaptation science and inform the development of future research on healthy forest management and conservation of forest-dependent wildlife species in the U.S.", "casc": "Northeast CASC"}, "502ab248e4b0a8e4a0fdb1c4": {"size": 2964332, "title": "Development Support for the NW Climate Science Center Science Agenda", "fy": "2011", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/502ab248e4b0a8e4a0fdb1c4", "summary": "The Oregon Water Science Center provided the scientific, bibliographic, and administrative support needed to prepare a Science Agenda for the Northwest Climate Science Center (NW CSC).

The estuary is also located on the Pacific Flyway, and is an important site for migrating and wintering birds. As climate conditions change, these salt marshes face a number of threats, including accelerated rates of sea-level rise, shifting precipitation, erosion, and more frequent and intense storms. Seas in the San Francisco Bay estuary have been rising 2.2 centimeters per decade, and could rise by as much as 1.24 meters by 2100, according to some projections.   The goal of this project was to identify how marsh plant communities in the San Francisco Bay estuary might be impacted by sea-level rise through 2100. Understanding the changes in salt marsh habitat will help wildlife managers identify the possible effects on wildlife species, enabling managers to start developing adaptation strategies now. To do this, researchers collected elevation, vegetation, and water level data at 12 tidal salt marshes around the San Francisco Bay estuary between 2008 and 2011. Using this information, they predicted the rate of marsh growth (i.e. accretion) and changes in plant communities at the sites through 2100.   Results show that the effects of sea-level rise will increase threats to already vulnerable wildlife in the San Francisco Bay estuary. Although some parts of the study area are projected to maintain marsh vegetation through 2100, these areas only comprise 4 percent of the total marsh area surveyed. The remaining 96 percent of marshes in the study area are projected to transition to mudflats by 2100. In fact, most areas are projected to lose high and mid-marsh vegetation by 2050. This type of vegetation provides critical habitat to the salt marsh harvest mouse, California black rail, and nesting songbirds.

Efforts of federal and state agencies and private landowners across the biome are focused on restoration and maintenance of conditions that support wildlife, livestock, energy development and many other uses. However, this semi-arid landscape presents challenges for management due to highly variable patterns in growing conditions leading to differences in plant composition, fuel accumulation and vegetation recovery. Much of this variability is created by soil and climate conditions. Recent work by multiple agencies and scientists defined relationships between soil and climate that characterize ecosystem recovery and resistance to degradation. These relations have important implications for management treatment outcomes, fuel profiles and fire risk, post-fire recovery and noxious weed invasions. Modern data and modeling applications focused on the soil environment can improve our ability to map variations in growing conditions. Instead of broadly classified climate regions, we model a continuous surface of grid cells using the soil and climate conditions unique to each location. The result is a spatially explicit simulation of evapotranspiration rates and soil moisture budgets across a large and variable landscape. This allows classification of each location according to traditional taxonomy and refined recognition of important variability of the soil-climate within those classes. Importantly, because this approach uses climate inputs, it can be informed by climate model scenarios to assess implications for habitat conditions, restoration outcomes and fuel profiles.

Yet wildfire activity is increasing across western North America, heightening concerns about severe fires that have the potential to kill the upper canopy layer of forests. Known as \u201cstand-replacing fires\u201d, these extreme events have important implications for forest ecosystems, initiating forest regrowth and altering habitat for wildlife.   Identifying locations that are protected from stand-replacing fire is an urgent management priority, particularly given projections of more extreme fires as climate conditions change. These \u201cfire refugia\u201d -  places that remain unburned or experience minimal tree mortality compared to the surrounding landscape - can be key to biodiversity conservation and adaptation. Despite concerns about increasing fire severity, mapping of fire refugia and stand-replacing fire has not been completed for old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest, hindering conservation planning for threatened and endangered species.  To address this need, researchers will map the probability of fire refugia and stand-replacing fire, based on topographic conditions, fire weather, fuel loads, and climate. They will then use this information to assess the likely future occurrence of old-growth, fire-resistant forests and young, post-fire forests in the Pacific Northwest under increasingly extreme fire weather. These maps will provide estimates of where old-growth forests are likely to persist, and where they are more susceptible to be lost to stand-replacing fires, supporting managers who are revising forest plans, implementing habitat conservation plans, and designing forest reserve networks in the region. Maps of likely refugia and stand-replacing fire also will help federal and state agencies, tribes, and non-governmental organizations identify locations for barred owl management, early-successional vegetation conservation, and sustainable forest management activities.", "casc": "Northwest CASC"}, "55e4d96be4b05561fa208585": {"size": 1324221, "title": "Understanding the Impacts of Glaciers on Streamflow in Alaska and Washington", "fy": "2015", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55e4d96be4b05561fa208585", "summary": "Glaciers are a central component to the hydrology of many areas in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.

The objectives of this study are to (1) combine statistical and dynamical downscaling methods to improve our scientific understanding of decadal scale climate variability in Hawai\u2018i; (2) develop projections of rainfall and temperature variability and change in the Hawaiian Islands; and (3) use historical and projected future climate variability to estimate the probability of exceeding important thresholds that could impact resource management planning and operations.", "casc": "Pacific CASC"}, "5016cd90e4b06fb5ce8b7376": {"size": 112720, "title": "A Handbook for Resource Managers to Understand and Utilize Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Wetland Models", "fy": "2012", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5016cd90e4b06fb5ce8b7376", "summary": " Coastal wetlands and the many beneficial services they provide (e.g., purifying water, buffering storm surge, providing habitat) are changing and disappearing as a result of sea-level rise brought about by climate change. Scientists have developed a wealth of information and resources to predict and aid decision-making related to sea-level rise. However, while some of these resources are easily accessible by coastal managers, many others require more expert knowledge to understand or utilize.  The goal of this project was to collate science and models pertaining to the effects of sea-level on coastal wetlands into a format that would be accessible and useful to resource managers. Researchers conducted training sessions with coastal managers at federal agencies including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Park Service to evaluate managers\u2019 needs and understanding of concepts, data, and modeling tools for projecting sea-level rise and its impact on coastal habitats and wildlife. Based on this feedback, researchers developed a handbook summarizing existing information and tools and their respective characteristics, uses, and limitations. The resulting handbook provides a user-friendly guide to understanding the current state of knowledge and tools suitable for managing coastal wetlands.  ", "casc": "Southeast CASC"}}

Natural resource managers and scientists in the Northeast, as well as the Northeast Refugia Research Coalition, coordinated by the Northeast CSC, recently identified vernal pools as a priority ecosystem to study, and recent revisions to State Wildlife Action Plans highlighted climate change and disease as primary threats to key vernal pool ecosystems. Mapping out the hydrology of vernal pools across the Northeast is an important step in informing land management and conservation decision-making.   Project researchers will collect hydrology data over the course of a year for 70 vernal pools. They will combine this information with existing data on vernal pool hydrology, targeted amphibian species (e.g., wood frogs and spotted salamanders), and the ranavirus and chytrid diseases that impact amphibians. This project will provide a preliminary assessment of the resistance of particular vernal pools to changes in climate by (1) modeling key aspects of vernal pool hydrology (inundated areas in spring, spring-to-summer changes in water cover etc.) based on climate and landscape drivers, and (2) relating vernal pool hydrology to amphibian occupancy and prevalence of disease.

The impacts of this warming on aquatic ecosystems are significant in many areas, causing problems for fisheries management, as many economically and ecologically important fish species are experiencing range shifts and population declines. Fisheries and natural resource managers need timely and usable data and tools in order to understand and predict changes to lakes and their biota.   A previous Northeast CSC-funded project modeled lake temperatures to help state agencies in the Midwest understand trends in walleye and largemouth bass populations and predict lake-specific fish populations under future climate scenarios. These results have been extremely valuable for decisions and management strategies at the state scale, and this new project will expand these efforts and will focus on lake temperature products at the three spatial scales of most interest to state agency stakeholders: lake, state, and region (for Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan).   The project researchers will use a \u201chyperscale\u201d modeling approach that will build upon the multi-state modeling framework developed in the earlier project to increase model accuracy for high priority managed lakes. This approach will use all observations of temperature that exist for every study lake in the region and use machine learning techniques to uncover biases in models used for lakes with many observations. The project will generate an improved assessment of aquatic habitat for lake fisheries, and will provide estimates of contemporary thermal habitats to be used by state partners to estimate the distribution and abundance of ecologically and economically important fish species. Deliverables for this project include: 1) hind-casted lake temperature profiles (1979-present), 2) summary outputs from the thermal models, and 3) individually tuned lake models for managers to use for testing and predicting future conditions under different climate change scenarios."}, {"node": 2, "name": "Development of the Wildlife Adaptation Menu for Resource Managers", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2017", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59de6101e4b05fe04ccd39b8", "num_items": 1, "items": {"5e98b56482ce172707f6aa86": {"title": "Final Report for Development of the Wildlife Adaptation Menu for Resource Managers", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e98b56482ce172707f6aa86"}}, "summary": "The Climate Change Response Framework is an example of a collaborative, cross-boundary approach to create a set of tools, partnerships, and actions to support climate-informed conservation and land management.

Not only do wildlife and resource managers need the best available science, it must also be presented in a usable format with feasible options within the purview of an individual manager.  The research team is first completing a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed studies to summarize what wildlife-related management actions currently exist in climate change adaptation. They will then develop and test a \u201cmenu\u201d of climate change adaptation actions that are suitable for wildlife management in terrestrial ecosystems. This Wildlife Adaptation Menu will be modeled off existing adaptation menus for Forestry and Urban Forestry, and it will be designed to be used in conjunction with the Adaptation Workbook. In addition to a menu of adaption strategies and approaches, the scientists will also identify site-level tactics and develop case studies demonstrating the use and implementation of the menu. To ensure that information and tools meet the needs of managers, the team is involving and integrating input from wildlife managers at every step of the process.

This study identified habitat and forest characteristics that improve the resiliency of forest dwelling amphibians and other wildlife to climate change. Further, by studying a foundational species in forest floor ecosystems, the scientists can use the information to make inferences about rare and declining species.  The researchers studied multiple red-backed salaamander populations across the range of the species, which primarily occurs in mature deciduous forests across the northeastern half of North America. They found evidence that salamanders will be negatively impacted by warmer temperatures and drier conditions, both in terms of how well they might survive but also in their ability to move around on the forest floor.

There are two general approaches of downscaling: dynamical and statistical. Within those, many dynamical models have been developed by different institutions, and there are a number of statistical algorithms that have been developed over the years. Many past studies have evaluated the performance of these two broad approaches of downscaling with respect to climate variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation), but few have translated these evaluations to ecological metrics that managers use to make decisions in planning for climate change. This study uses maple syrup production as a case study for evaluating how these two downscaling techniques perform in terms of projecting changes in the tapping season. Maple syrup producers are interested in how climate change will affect their industry. Our results will give them a sense of the range they can expect for different aspects of the tapping season (timing of tap date, length of season, quality of sap, etc.).

Most efforts to assess the likely impacts of climate change on biodiversity try to rank species based on their vulnerability under changed environmental conditions. These efforts have generally not considered the ability of organisms to adjust their phenotype to the changing environment. Organisms can do this by one of two ways. First, they can adjust their phenotype via non-evolutionary pathways. Second, they can undergo adaptive evolutionary change. We used two interconnected approaches to evaluate thermal adaptation capacity in a cold-water fish species. 1) Using tagging data, we estimated thermal performance curves for wild fish. The curves indicate how fish body growth will respond to changing temperatures. 2) Using genomic approaches, we developed a unified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel for use across the species\u2019 range to examine adaptive capacity. This panel can be used for high throughput genotyping of individuals to understand genetic diversity, health, and potential for thermal adaptation. Additionally, with the SNP panel we provide a valuable resource to the community of researchers working on Brook Trout conservation and management.  The SNP panel will make it possible for individual datasets collected across the range to be standardized so that they can be used to examine both local processes and range wide patterns. Overall, our results help us understand how Brook Trout will respond to a changing climate.

The scenarios serve both to identify climate change impacts unique to each participating Tribe and to propose solutions for adaptation and resiliency that are relevant for each scenario. The scenarios can be used as the basis for motivating more extensive Tribal adaptation plans, justifying future Tribal adaptation/mitigation projects, and creating the foundation for more sophisticated collaborations between Tribes, other parties and the Northeast Climate Science Center that harness robust risk analysis, decision tools and modeling. The scenarios, then, serve as the basis for characterizing climate change vulnerabilities and the needed capacities to address them.

Throughout this project, researchers engaged with state and federal resource managers, tribal groups, and other maple syrup producers to facilitate the adaptation of maple sugaring to climate change and aid in preserving this culturally and economically significant tradition in the Northeast and Midwest.

This project sought to provide an example of cooperative landscape decision-making by addressing the conservation of headwater stream ecosystems in the face of climate change at the watershed scale. Predictive models were built for critical resources to examine the effects of the potential alternative actions on the objectives, taking account of climate effects and examining whether there are key uncertainties that impede decision making. Results provide decision analyses that are (1) relevant to the management partners in question; (2) emblematic of landscape-scale cooperative decisions; and (3) sensitive to the practical consequences of climate change.  The successful application of structured decision making (SDM) requires the involvement of resource managers at each step in the decision. By involving federal, state, local and non-profit management organizations, the PIs ensure that the decision outcomes are suitable for all involved. Though they may identify a decision which is not optimal for each management organization, species group, or protected area of a given watershed individually, collectively results will be able to satisfy the regional objectives for headwater stream systems.

We predicted the distribution and abundance of common tree species across portions of the eastern U.S. under alternative climate scenarios that varied in the amount of warming by the end of the century from 1.1 to 4.2 degrees celsius. We used a forest landscape change model to forecast changes in tree abundances and distribution in the North Atlantic region of the U.S. while accounting for climate change, succession, and harvest. We then considered a broader region of the U.S. and combined our results with results from previous studies to compare forecasts from three different modeling approaches for the Central Hardwood, Central Appalachian, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regions to determine the level of agreement among models.  Our forecasts for the North Atlantic region indicated tree abundances were affected first by succession and harvest but second by climate. We predicted an increase in Southern and Central Hardwood species and a decrease in Northern Hardwood and spruce-fir forest species under warming climates over the next 300 years. Our comparison of the three modeling approaches across the eastern U.S. indicated high agreement for many species, especially northern species modeled to lose habitat in coming decades. There was agreement among models for decreases in black spruce, balsam fir, northern white cedar, and red spruce, and increases in loblolly pine and some oaks and hickories. Agreement across different modeling approaches and different climate scenarios provides strong evidence of potentially important changes to forests in response to climate change. These results can be used to guide decisions about how to manage forests under climate change to continue to provide the benefits we derive from them.

Extensive portions of prairie have already been lost due to agriculture and urbanization, and as a result grassland birds have declined more than any other bird group in the last four decades. Now, climate change could exacerbate existing threats to these birds as temperatures in certain prairie ecosystems are expected to rise and extreme weather events, such as drought, could become more common.  The goal of this project was to develop a framework to identify demographic sensitivities and assess the vulnerability of grassland bird species to future climate change. To do so, the researchers developed a strong partnership among managers and researchers to understand how climate change might impact the conservation and management planning of grassland birds throughout the Northeast CASC region and identify potentially vulnerable species. Using input from managers, the team focused their efforts on two grassland indicator species of high conservation interest: Henslow\u2019s Sparrows and Bobolinks. They developed spatially-explicit and temporally dynamic species distribution models for these indicator species and evaluated the effects of past and future climate on their populations. Finally, they studied how weather and extreme events (e.g., drought and flooding) effect the breeding success of grassland birds across North America.  By incorporating information on future climate change, the project team has identified regions where Henslow's Sparrows, a species of increasing conservation concern, are likely to face unsuitable conditions for reproduction. In addition, they have identified areas that will serve as likely refugia for this species in the future. The researchers have performed the first-ever exploration of the synergistic effects of weather and grassland patch size, the most common currency of grassland bird conservation and management. They have found that large grasslands serve as an important buffer of extreme temperature and precipitation on grassland bird nesting success.

This work capitalized on a rich suite of long-term data from these ecosystems to document recent trends in these forests and their associated bird species and developed tools for predicting their future abundance under climate change. Findings from this work indicate declining trends in the abundance of spruce-fir obligate birds, including Bicknell\u2019s Thrush, across the Lake States and New England. In contrast, montane spruce-fir forests in the White and Green Mountains of New England exhibited patterns of increasing abundance, potentially due to their recovery from the negative impacts of historic land use and pollution. Despite these recent trends, long-term predictions of future abundance for the dominant species found in spruce-fir forests (black, red, and white spruce and balsam fir) indicated large declines in these species from across much of the northeastern United States by the year 2090. Several areas were recognized where these forests might persist, including high elevation portions of New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont and in large portions of northwestern Maine. An understanding of these future dynamics is critical for informing and prioritizing conservation efforts aimed at protecting these ecosystems and associated wildlife species under future climate change and speak to the importance of sustaining long-term monitoring efforts to assist these decisions.

For example, plants might be relocated to support pollinator conservation or the restoration of prairies. Some land managers, in an effort to be proactive in the face of changing environmental conditions, are also considering relocating plants to sites that are considered more similar to anticipated future conditions. However, moving plants can be ecologically and economically risky. It\u2019s possible that pests, pathogens, or contaminant weeds can be inadvertently moved along with the target plant material. In 2016, the noxious weed Palmer amaranth was introduced to Minnesota as a contaminant in seed brought in to improve Monarch butterfly and pollinator habitat. This fast growing weed is capable of reducing soybean yields by 78% and corn yields by 91%, and requires costly resources to fight its spread.   One factor that impacts the risk associated with plant movement is the distance between the source of the plant and where it is being relocated to. If the source is located near the translocation site, it is less likely to be contaminated with new weeds or pathogens. The goal of this project is to create a framework for evaluating risk associated with the movement of plant material. The first tier of the framework will describe the future condition of the species, site, or community of concern, if plant movement is implemented and if it is not. The second tier will assess the ecological risks associated with moving plant material. This will include identifying potential pathogens, weeds, and pests that might be associated with plants from different areas and could be inadvertently introduced during translocation, and evaluating the potential harm these species might cause if introduced. The benefit of such a framework will be to greatly reduce the likelihood of unintended introductions of pests and noxious species. It will also take into account the ability of plants to adapt to expected future environmental conditions in their new locations. This work will support a range of stakeholders, including private, state, federal, and non-profit land managers who undertake planting for conservation or restoration.   Once the risk assessment framework is complete, researchers will test it for prairie restoration. This project will focus on the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota, but the results will also be broadly relevant to grassland managers in the central U.S."}, {"node": 25, "name": "Refugia are Important but are they Connected?

One specific management strategy is based on the idea that in certain locations, climate conditions will remain suitable for species to continue to inhabit into the future. These locations are known as climate \u201crefugia\u201d. In contrast, other locations may become too hot, dry, or wet for species to continue to inhabit. When wildlife managers are considering protecting land for vulnerable species, it can be helpful for them to understand where these climate refugia are located, so that they can be prioritized for conservation.   However, most tools used by resource managers to manage these important places identify the geographic locations of refugia, but do not examine how connected those locations are to other refugia or how accessible they are to current species distributions. This project aims to close this knowledge gap. The main objective of this project is to provide a map of projected refugia networks at the end of the century for each of 10 Species in Greatest Conservation Need in the northeastern U.S. A preliminary list of species includes Canada Lynx, Saltmarsh Sparrow, Spotted Turtle, Wood Turtle, Bicknell\u2019s Thrush, Moose, Prairie Warbler, Cerulean Warbler, Blackpoll Warbler, and Virginia Rail, however this list will be finalized with input from stakeholders in the region. Researchers will identify locations of climate refugia for each species and then map how well each refugia is connected to the species\u2019 current distribution as well as other refugia.   This project will result in maps of well-connected refugia that will remain crucial habitat for wildlife given current and future changes in climate. This information will support efforts of the USFWS Northeast Region to assess habitat needs for several species under federal consideration for listing as well as other Species of Greatest Conservation Need. Maps of refugia connectivity will also support the prioritization of on-the-ground habitat management in the region."}, {"node": 26, "name": "Supporting Early Career Climate Communications and Networking", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2014", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/544e5d2fe4b024090688fce6", "num_items": 2, "items": {"5cbf4b1ce4b0c3b00664fe38": {"title": "Webinar: Leveraging Web-Based Platforms such as the Early Career Climate Forum to Enhance Climate Change Communication and Engagement", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5cbf4b1ce4b0c3b00664fe38"}, "5cbf358be4b0c3b00664fcf4": {"title": "Final Report- Early Career Climate Communications and Networking", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5cbf358be4b0c3b00664fcf4"}}, "summary": "The Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey have made it a priority to train the next generation of scientists and resource managers.

This can potentially result in mismatches or asynchronies in food and habitat resources that negatively impact individual fitness, population dynamics, and ecosystem function. Numerous studies have evaluated phenological shifts in terrestrial species, particularly birds and plants, yet far fewer evaluations have been conducted for marine animals.  This project sought to improve our understanding of shifts in the timing of seasonal migration, spawning or breeding, and biological development (i.e. life stages present, dominant) of coastal fishes and migratory waterbirds along the U.S Atlantic coast. Through stakeholder engagement and outreach across the Northeast region we formed an interdisciplinary working group that developed a regional synthesis of how the timing of biological and human activities were shifting in the Gulf of Maine. We also identified two high priority case studies to focus evaluations and deeper analyses of factors contributing to observed shifts: 1) anadromous river herring in Massachusetts coastal streams, and 2) nesting seabirds across the Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge. We used a combined approach of synthesis and modeling to determine the direction, magnitude and extent of spatial shifts, as well as identify data gaps and future research needs. The results pointed to complex and location-specific phenological responses to climate-linked variables, but capacity for adaptive strategies to minimize risks to species. Project results are anticipated to increase the efficacy of management and planning tools which can be compromised when target species experience shifts in the timing of life history events.

These lands have the potential to provide valuable ecosystem services, like wildlife habitat, nutrient processing, carbon sequestration, and flood-water storage, that produce economic values in terms of recreational spending, improved water quality, and decreased flood hazards. However, floodplain managers may need tools to help them understand changing conditions on conservation lands.  This project worked with floodplain managers to identify the information most needed to understand nonstationary conditions, and to develop tools they can apply to conservation lands to improve decision making. Through an online survey and workshop with managers, the researchers found that time, funding, and a perceived disconnect between research and management limited the ability of managers to use new scientific information. However, managers revealed that they were willing to partner with scientists to identify science needs and products useful for management decisions.  Floodplain managers agreed that metrics of water inundation, including depth, extent, frequency, duration, and seasonality are the most useful metrics to inform management of floodplain conservation lands. The research team used scientific models of flood inundation under different climate scenarios to examine these metrics for the lower 500 miles of the Missouri River to aid in current and future management decisions of conservation properties. They found that annually, climate change is estimated to increase the duration, frequency, depth, and extent of flooding. However, these patterns vary seasonally, with inundation increasing in the spring and decreasing in the fall."}, {"node": 31, "name": "Projecting Changes in Snow, Lake Ice, and Winter Severity in the Great Lakes Region for Wildlife-Based Adaptation Planning", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2014", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/529e2c12e4b0516126f68ee8", "num_items": 6, "items": {"5a5fb99ae4b06e28e9bfc506": {"title": "Long-term trends in weather severity indices for dabbling ducks in eastern North America", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a5fb99ae4b06e28e9bfc506"}, "5a55355be4b01e7be242bdb4": {"title": "Final Project Report: Projecting Changes in Snow, Lake Ice, and Winter Severity in the Great Lakes Region for Wildlife-Based Adaptation Planning", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a55355be4b01e7be242bdb4"}, "58e4f9eae4b09da679997ac3": {"title": "Ice, Snow, and Swamp: Managing Deer in Michigan\u2019s Changing Climate", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58e4f9eae4b09da679997ac3"}, "58e4f45be4b09da679997aa7": {"title": "Dynamical Downscaling\u2013Based Projections of Great Lakes Water Levels", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58e4f45be4b09da679997aa7"}, "58c3073be4b0f37a93ed9185": {"title": "Projected Influences of Changes in Weather Severity on Autumn-Winter Distributions of Dabbling Ducks in the Mississippi and Atlantic Flyways during the Twenty-First Century", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58c3073be4b0f37a93ed9185"}, "5a553984e4b01e7be242bdc1": {"title": "Dynamically Downscaled Projections of Lake-Effect Snow in the Great Lakes Basin", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a553984e4b01e7be242bdc1"}}, "summary": "Winter conditions have changed substantially in the Great Lakes region over the last 50 years, with the region experiencing rising temperatures, declining lake ice cover, and increased lake-effect snow. These changes have direct implications for economically important wildlife, such as deer and waterfowl. Deer hunting alone contributes $482 million annually to Wisconsin\u2019s economy.   The goal of this project was to identify how winter severity, snowpack, and lake ice could change through the mid- and late-21st century, and how species such as the white-tailed deer and mallard duck will respond. Because currently available climate data is at too coarse a scale to provide information on future conditions for the Great Lakes, researchers transformed these models from a global-scale to a regional-scale.    Using these models, researchers found that the region could experience substantial warming, reduced lake ice cover, and increased precipitation, with more precipitation falling as rain than snow, among other changes. Snow/ice cover limit foraging by waterfowl, thereby regulating the timing/intensity of migration and their distributions during non-breeding season. Reductions in weather severity could result in delayed autumn-winter migration for dabbling ducks, which would increase foraging pressures on wetlands in the Great Lakes region \u2013 highlighting the importance of protecting these wetlands. These changes in migration patterns could also lead to potentially significant economic losses in southern flyway states, as ducks may stay in the Great Lakes region during the winter months. The primary wintertime stressors for deer are air chill and snow depth, with extreme winters triggering population declines.  Changes in wildlife abundance and distribution can incur dramatic ecological, societal, and economic impacts. Warming may support expanded deer populations and overgrazing, while elevating infectious disease threats to deer. Annually in the U.S., 13.4 million people participate in deer and migratory bird hunting, generating $21.5 billion in revenue, with the hunting industry supporting 681,000 jobs.    Predictions of the future distribution of ducks and other wildlife in the region will help guide the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Ducks Unlimited, and other stakeholders in developing conservation and adaptation strategies for vulnerable species and in mitigating the potential economic losses that might result from changes in species distribution.

Coastal habitats also provide protective ecosystem services to human communities, which are increasingly at risk to storms and sea level rise under future climate change. Understanding how climate change will impact natural and human communities is a crucial part of decision making and management related to the protection of our coasts.   In a collaborative project between the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NA LCC) and the Northeast Climate Science Center, researchers compiled existing threshold information on priority coastal fish, wildlife, and plant species as well as coastal habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and Caribbean in response to sea level rise and storm projections. As the effects of climate change on ecological and human communities grow, the possibility of crossing tipping points or thresholds of viability increases the potential for rapid and possibly irreversible changes in ecosystems. Therefore, understanding thresholds related to climate change is critical for facilitating conservation and management actions, which could help to prevent more costly and possibly catastrophic effects in the near (years to decades) and distant (decades to centuries) future. The compilation of this information will help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how natural systems will respond to climate change and how land and resource management decisions could potentially help these species.     Researchers further compiled natural and nature-based approaches to restoration and management that benefit both natural and human communities in the coastal zone, as well as synthesized information on the suite of ecosystem services provided by tidal marshes, beaches and barrier islands, mangroves, and shellfish beds. This work will inform climate change adaptation and resilience planning and assist coastal communities that must weigh important tradeoffs regarding the benefits and drawbacks of green and grey coastal infrastructure.

Known as phenology, the timing of these events is very sensitive to changes in climate (and changes in one species\u2019 phenology can impact entire food webs and ecosystems). Shifts in phenology have been described as a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the temporal and spatial responses of wildlife to climate change impacts. Thus, phenology provides one of the strongest indicators of the adaptive capacity of organisms (or the ability of organisms to cope with future environmental conditions).  In this study, researchers are exploring how the timing and occurrence of a number of highly migratory marine animals is changing due to a series of climatic and ecological shifts. First, using existing long-term historical data series, they will determine the direction and magnitude of how migration, abundance, or other phenological factors have changed for marine mammals, sea turtles, and fishes that migrate into the Gulf of Maine on a seasonal basis. Because marine animals are inherently difficult to detect, the team will apply dynamic occupancy models to evaluate seasonal migration patterns and habitat use across multiple habitats in the Gulf of Maine region. The project team will also synthesize regional information on a key, ecologically-important prey fish, sandlance, whose timing and abundance is a strong predictor of the occurrence and behavior of predator species targeted in this study as well as a range of other regional fish and wildlife of conservation and management concern. Results from this component of the project will identify coastal fish and wildlife species that are relatively more or less able to adapt and thus potentially vulnerable to climate change; determine the likely primary drivers of those changes; and identify data gaps and future monitoring needs. Ultimately, this information will be available and useful for regional coastal management and adaptation decisions that will allow managers to effectively plan for the future.   In a second component of the project, researchers will focus specifically on changes in migration patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale. While shifts in the distribution and time of recurring life events are adaptive responses that may help species cope with climate impacts, they can also lead to changes in how species interact with humans. The North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered whale species on the planet. In the North Atlantic Ocean, ship strikes and entanglements with commercial fishing gear represent fatal threats to right whales. Recent reports suggest that North Atlantic right whale migration patterns have changed. Many researchers posit that shifts in migration are responsible for recent increases in the overlap between right whales and human activities, especially fishing. To help understand how changes in right whale movements and behaviors may overlap with ship traffic, and thus put the animals at risk of encountering vessels, we will combine right whale habitat models with ship traffic maps. The end result will be a set of maps identifying risk levels.

To better anticipate these changes, there is a need to compile both short- and long-term stream temperature data for managers to gain an understanding of baseline conditions, historic trends, and future projections. Unfortunately, many agencies lack sufficient resources to compile, conduct quality assurance and control, and make accessible stream temperature data collected through routine monitoring. Yet, pooled data from many sources, even if temporally and spatially inconsistent, can have great value both in the realm of stream temperature and aquatic response. The NorEaST web portal was developed to serve as a coordinated, multi-agency regional framework to map and store continuous stream temperature locations and data for New England, Mid Atlantic, and Great Lakes states. NorEaST consists of a mapper where the public can view locations and metadata for current and historic stream temperature monitoring sites, a database where data stewards can store and manage their data, and web services to connect, communicate, and serve data for use in analysis and applications. Currently, stream temperature monitoring locations and metadata can be viewed for more than 10,000 monitoring locations across 30 states, contributed by 40 different organizations. Organizations collecting continuous stream temperature data can request to become NorEaST users and data stewards can use the web portal to store and manage their organization\u2019s continuous stream temperature data. To demonstrate the utility of large scale, consistent stream temperature data for use in regional analyses and decision-making, stream temperature data collected as part of the NorEaST project were used in three different targeted applications. These applications included generating stream thermal metrics, analyzing fish species response to stream thermal metrics, and evaluating stream temperature modeling approaches for use by aquatic resource managers.

As a result, staff of resource management agencies and organizations are faced with trying to determine how to use these multiple products to effectively and efficiently meet their needs.  To address this question in the Northeast and Midwest U.S., the NE CSC funded a project to critically evaluate these ecosystem or habitat mapping methods and to move toward standardization of these maps.

We sought insights by examining Lake Erie as a representative system with a high level of anthropogenic impacts, strong nutrient gradients, seasonal hypoxia, and spatial overlap of cold- and cool-water fish guilds. In Lake Erie and in large embayments throughout the Great Lakes basin, this situation is a concern for fishery managers, as climate change may exacerbate hypoxia and reduce habitat volume for some species. We examined fish community composition, fine-scale distribution, prey availability, diets, and biochemical tracers for dominant fishes from study areas with medium-high nutrient levels (mesotrophic, Fairport study area), and low nutrient levels (oligotrophic, Erie study area). This multi-year database (2011-2013) provides the ability to contrast years with wide variation in rainfall, winter ice-cover, and thermal stratification. In addition, multiple indicators of dietary and distributional responses to environmental variability will allow resource managers to select the most informative approach for addressing specific climate change questions.  Our results support the incorporation of some relatively simple and cost-efficient approaches into existing agency monitoring programs to track the near-term condition status of fish and fish community composition by functional groupings. Other metrics appear better suited for understanding longer-term changes, and may take more resources to implement on an ongoing basis. Although we hypothesized that dietary overlap and similarity in selected species would be sharply different during thermal stratification and hypoxic episodes, we found little evidence of this. Instead, to our surprise, this study found that fish tended to aggregate at the edges of hypoxia, highlighting potential spatial changes in catch efficiency of the fishery.  This work has had several positive impacts on a wide range of resource management and stakeholder activities, most notably in Lake Erie. The results were instrumental in the development of an interim decision rule for dealing with data collected during hypoxic events to improve stock assessment of Yellow Perch. In addition, novel findings from this study regarding spatial and temporal variability in hypoxia have aided US-Environmental Protection Agency in the development of a modified sampling protocol to more accurately quantify the central basin hypoxic zone, and this directly addressed a goal of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 2012 to reduce the extent and severity of hypoxia. Finally, the study areas developed in this project formed the basis for food web sampling in the 2014 bi-national Coordinated Science and Monitoring Initiative work in Lake Erie.

Although some variability in fish catches is expected across factors such as location and season, we know less about how large-scale disturbances like climate change will influence population variability.  The Laurentian Great Lakes in North America are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world, and they have experienced major changes due to fluctuations in pollution and nutrient loadings, exploitation of natural resources, introductions of non-native species, and shifting climatic patterns.  In this project, we analyzed established long-term data about important fish populations from across the Great Lakes basin, including from Oneida Lake in NY, Lake Michigan, and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Our objective was to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in fish catches from large freshwater lakes that have experienced large-scale changing conditions.  We evaluated analytical approaches with the potential to disentangle sources of variability in standardized monitoring data.  Specifically, we considered 1) how the decomposition of spatial and temporal variation in fish catches can be used to measure a response to perturbation; 2) how truncation of population age structure can alter population oscillations which may shift how a population is affected by environmental fluctuations; and 3) how the composition of a fish community may respond to a suite of environmental drivers through time. Using long-term gill-net data for walleye, we found that average catch and variance structure differed before and after large-scale perturbations. More generally, our results suggest that fish population responses to changing environments can be complex, but that long-term monitoring combined with modeling approaches can allow for detection of quantifiable changes."}, {"node": 40, "name": "Science to Examine the Interactions Between Climate, Agriculture, and Water Quality", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2012", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/51826b32e4b04bbc6ead2728", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "The purpose of the project was to conduct an extensive search for compelted and ongoing research that deals with climate change and agriculture in the context of water quality, for the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie and Big Rivers Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) and the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes LCC.

One portion of the search dealt with an online literature search for published peer-reviewed articles for the period of approximately 2000 to present. The second portion of the search dealt with contacting US Geological Survey (USGS) Water Science Centers and state institutions to request information on current research projects dealing with this topic that have not yet been published or are currently in publication. Geographic location was considered during the search, and only projects and publications taking place within one of the LCC\u2019s were acquired. The two LCC\u2019s cover partial states in some cases, but searches were conducted for the state as a whole if any portion of the state fell within one of the two LCC's. In addition, relevant publications were obtained for southern Ontario, Canada. An outline for search methodology, including sources and keywords, was used to keep the search process consistent and well-documented. In addition, manual filtering of results was required to ensure that they were both contextually and geographically relevant.  While the effort is likely not entirely exhaustive, the methodology entailed a progression of searches using multiple search engines and resources that upon completion did not return any results that had not already been acquired. The software tool EndNote was selected for compiling the database as this tool assisted in streamlining the process of publication retrieval during the literature search. It also standardized the way in which publications were recorded and provided a means to organize, reduce redundancy, and search the database. The resulting products for each LCC were aggregated to produce one final EndNote library. The library was categorized by geographic location but can be categorized using various criteria and keyword searches within EndNote. Through cooperation with the Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA), a searchable format geared toward the general end-user can be generated.

Therefore, sea-level rise and the associated changes in coastlines challenge both human communities and ecosystems.  Understanding which coastal lands will be vulnerable to sea-level rise is critical for policy makers, land-use planners, and coastal residents. Focusing on the coastal region from Virginia to Maine, researchers examined a range of different possible sea-level rise scenarios, combined with information on features of the coastal landscape (such as elevation and land cover type), to forecast which coastal areas would likely flood, and which would likely change or move as a result of sea-level rise. Researchers found that 70 percent of the Northeast U.S. Atlantic Coast has the capacity to change over the next several decades in response to rising seas.  Knowing where coastal habitats are likely to be resilient, where they will likely change, and where they might flood as a result of sea-level rise is essential for developing management and resource allocation strategies that preserve coastal areas. By distinguishing the response of coastlines to different sea-level rise scenarios, the results of this project can inform coastal land management decision-making about how to best adapt human and natural communities to potential future changes to coastal areas.

There is ample literature on the effects of long-term climate change and short-term climate variability on the occurrence of droughts. However, it is unclear whether this information meets the needs of relevant stakeholders and actually contributes to reducing the vulnerability or increasing the resilience of communities to droughts. For example, are the methods used to characterize the severity of drought \u2013 known as drought indices \u2013 effective tools for predicting the actual damage felt by communities?   As droughts continue to increase in frequency and severity, the need to understand community vulnerability and resilience to drought is only growing. Focusing on New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, this study sought to answer several key questions. First, researchers examined whether existing drought indices are effective in predicting the occurrence of drought events and their actual damages. Second, researchers explored why some communities suffer less damage from drought and recover faster than others. Finally, researchers identified strategies for encouraging the adoption of water conservation behaviors among residents. So far, results show that drought indices are overall useful tools for predicting drought damage and that a community\u2019s resilience to drought is often tied to socioeconomic conditions.   This research was conducted in partnership with two Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. In addition to gaining the scientific knowledge of the linkages between drought indices, damages, and community resilience, this research (1) developed tools to measure drought resilience, (2) identified key indicators of resilience, (3) identified the gaps between drought indices and actual damages, and (4) identified the factors that influence residents\u2019 decisions to adopt adaptive measures.

However, as climate conditions change, the region is experiencing more frequent and severe droughts, with significant impacts on agriculture and broader consequences for land management. For example, in 2011 drought caused an estimated $7.6 billion in agricultural losses in Texas and an additional $1.6 billion in Oklahoma. Although there are many drought monitoring tools available, most of these tools were developed without input from the stakeholders, such as farmers and ranchers, who are intended to use them.   The goal of this project was to assess the information needs of farmers, ranchers, and local land managers in the South Central region and to develop drought monitoring tools that are effective and responsive to their needs. The results of this project are meant to be directly and immediately applicable to land management decisions in the region. Further, this approach to improving drought monitoring could be applied to other regions of the country facing similar challenges. Finally, in addition to advancing our knowledge of how drought information is used, this project aimed to contribute to our understanding of how private land owners and agronomists make decisions related to landscape-scale change.

While on-the-ground conditions that promote fire development in the region are still not well understood, research suggests that fire-friendly conditions are determined by more than just precipitation amounts or wind speeds. They are also influenced by soil characteristics such as moisture content, temperature, and human use. Therefore, fire weather forecast predictions could be improved by developing a better understanding of the relationship between soil characteristics and fire occurrence.  With a hotter and drier future unfolding in the southern Great Plains, the time is now to consider how soil moisture dynamics are expected to change and what influence, if any, this will have on fire potential. This project aimed to fine-tune fire weather forecast predictions using soil temperature and soil moisture for a variety of managed and unmanaged systems in West Texas and Oklahoma. Accounting for these conditions improves our understanding of what regions and time periods are and will be favorable to fire conditions. This information is meant to give managers a more complete picture of fire risk, thus helping to inform fire prevention, crop production, and conservation decisions across the region.

It flows south from the snow-capped mountains of Colorado through the New Mexico desert, forms the border between Texas and Mexico, and empties into the Gulf of Mexico at Brownsville, Texas. The multi-national, multi-state, ecologically diverse nature of this river makes management of the resource a complex task, especially in the context of more frequent droughts, changes in land use patterns, and increasing water use needs.  The main objective of this project was to assess the state of water resources management policies and planning tools for the Lower Rio Grande-Rio Bravo Basin. The project researchers developed an inventory of water management information and compiled a list of all the available models that can be used to evaluate human and environmental water management objectives. As part of this effort, the team identified the applicability of those models to evaluating trade-offs for meeting societal and environmental flow requirements to restore native ecosystems. They also identified information gaps that merit additional research and resources and described promising future steps to integrate and improve existing systems models.  Findings from this research show that there are a variety of models that can assist planning activities to implement environmental flows across the Basin. However, no models with the appropriate spatial extent and the necessary time-step exist for developing operational environmental flow targets in the basin. This work provides water resource managers with valuable insight as they work to balance human and ecological water needs throughout the basin.

However, fire suppression and more frequent droughts in the region have resulted in a build-up of dry fuels loads such as dead wood, resulting in fires that burn hotter and impact the landscape more severely. Uncontrolled wildfires have cost the region several billion dollars over the past five years. Further, fire suppression has resulted in substantial losses in native plant biodiversity and wildlife habitat, which also has costly implications. In Oklahoma alone, it\u2019s estimated that $157 million will be required to restore rangelands to their native conditions. Of further concern is the fact that projected changes in climate indicate that the region will continue to experience hotter and drier conditions, meaning that fire risks will continue to increase unless proper management strategies, such as prescribed fire, are implemented.  In order to develop effective fire management responses, ongoing research into the changing scope and intensity of fire regimes in the region needs to be better connected to management practitioners and their expertise. This project was designed to help managers respond to changing fire regimes by analyzing historical climate observations and future projections to identify days which are suitable for prescribed burns as well as days of high wildfire potential. Results from the analysis were presented and discussed at a fire summit convening leading researchers, agencies, and land owners. The summit also brought together fire experts to discuss the safe and proper application of fire in a changing and variable climate, along with management strategies for fire and its role in combating invasive plant species, maintaining productive landscapes, and enhancing wildlife habitat.

This project will be the first to demonstrate how non-native Brown Trout negatively affect Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout populations. The project has two primary objectives: 1) compare the health and characteristics of native Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout in areas both with and without invasive Brown Trout in cold and warm streams; and 2) determine if competition with invasive Brown Trout for food resources is associated with reductions in Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout populations. Understanding the relationship between temperature and non-native species invasion for this southernmost subspecies of cutthroat trout will benefit all cutthroat subspecies into the future as northern latitudes endure the effects of both a warming climate and continued non-native trout invasions.   Although the Rio Grande cutthroat trout is not at immediate risk of extinction according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, more than half of the remaining populations are considered to be in fair or poor condition. Results from this project will be valuable and useful for managers tasked with balancing Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout restoration efforts while maintaining popular sportfish destinations.

Understanding each of these periods of water scarcity and water abundance can help water managers to design adaptation strategies that cope with these two extremes while still supporting human and environmental water management needs.

This project sought to address this gap by developing new software tools that enable stakeholders to quickly develop custom, climate-sensitive land-use projections to satisfy a range of application needs. Stakeholders from across the region participated in the development of the model through two workshops, designed to first gather stakeholder needs and then to apply and evaluate the model to ensure that it maximizes potential use across all stakeholder groups.

More than half of the Rio Grande\u2019s streamflow originates as snowmelt in Colorado\u2019s mountains, meaning that changes in the amount of snowmelt can impact the water supply for communities along the entire river. Snowmelt runoff is therefore an important component of water supply outlooks for the region, which are used by a variety of stakeholders to anticipate water availability in the springtime.   It is critical that these water supply outlooks be as accurate as possible. Errors can cost states millions of dollars due to mis-allocation of water and lost agricultural productivity. There is a perception that runoff forecast accuracy has declined over the last several decades in Colorado and New Mexico, making water supply outlooks less reliable. Declines in accuracy could be related to changes in climate and land cover; however, potential sources of error have not yet been examined in the upper Rio Grande basin.   This study aims to improve runoff forecast models for the upper Rio Grande. Researchers will identify potential sources of error in existing models, improve the representation of snowpack in models of the watershed, develop a new hydrologic model for the basin, and test this model\u2019s ability to forecast runoff. The end product of this study will be a tool for making improved runoff forecasts for the upper Rio Grande basin. The tool will be transferable to other snowmelt-dominated basins in the region that have similar characteristics.

The researchers addressed this goal using a variety of approaches, including evaluating connectivity of major habitat types (grasslands and forests), predicting future changes in landscape connectivity for grassland species, assessing terrestrial vertebrate diversity in relation to habitat loss and fragmentation, and analyzing the combined effects of climate and habitat fragmentation on the distributions of grassland bird species.  They found that connectivity has declined for species with a low to moderate ability to move across the landscape, and that this pattern is expected to continue under future scenarios of land-use change. For grassland birds, the contribution of climate, landscape variables, and their combined effects varied among species, but their combined effects can exceed the independent effects of the two drivers for some species. Thus, the importance of connectivity is expected to increase with the negative implications of climate change for wildlife populations and communities. These results, which are expressed in maps, can be used to inform management decisions and identify future research needs related to terrestrial connectivity within this region.

At the same time, tribes have valuable traditional knowledge that can aid regional efforts to address climate change.   There were two overarching goals of this project: The first was to build partnerships between South Central Climate Science Center (SC CSC) researchers and tribal communities, linking tribes with climate change tools and resources and developing a model that could be replicated in other regions. The second goal was to document tribal viewpoints on climate change impacts and adaptation, so that these perspectives could be considered alongside scientific research.   Researchers developed and implemented a series of five workshops \u2013 four in Oklahoma and one in New Mexico \u2013 that brought together SC CSC researchers and more than 60 tribal members from 33 tribes across the central U.S. The workshops provided an opportunity to educate tribal environmental managers about climate change impacts and conservation strategies, to document the climate-related needs and capabilities of the region\u2019s tribal nations, and to build conversation about climate change between researchers and tribal leaders.   In conjunction with the workshops, two indigenous filmmakers on the research team conducted interviews and incorporated these and related footage into a short film titled Listening for the Rain: Indigenous Perspectives on Climate Change.

Water moving through these aquifers carves out magnificent caves, sinkholes, and other formations. These formations are home to high concentrations of rare and endangered species, but the hydrological conditions that support these species can change rapidly. Managing these ecosystems into the future requires a better understanding of how climate, hydrology, and karst ecosystems interact.  The objective of this project was to determine how species and ecosystems associated with karst might respond to future temperature and precipitation extremes and accompanying changes in groundwater levels and springflow. The research focused on 16 species in the Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas and eight species in the Madison aquifer in western South Dakota. Researchers linked global climate models, regional climate models, and hydrologic models to determine how future springflow might be impacted by changes in temperature and precipitation. By combining information about future hydrology with what we know about species needs, researchers determined the vulnerability of the selected species to climate extremes.  Researchers found that more species in the Edwards aquifer are vulnerable to climate extremes than in the Madison aquifer, due in part to the more severe hydrologic changes that the Edwards aquifer is expected to undergo. This result suggests that including hydrologic factors critical to species health is essential in evaluating the vulnerability of karst ecosystems to climate extremes. Natural resource managers can use this information to understand how the character of karst systems are changing and prioritize conservation activities accordingly.

However, the potential effects of sea-level rise is posing new questions about the future availability of SAV for waterfowl and other coastal wildlife. Of primary concern is the fact that rising seas have the potential to increase salinities in fresh and brackish marshes on the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s coast, changing the distribution and composition of SAV communities, and affecting valuable waterfowl habitat and food resources. Not enough is known about the relationship between salinity and SAV to predict how this important food resource will respond to higher salinity levels, creating difficulties for waterfowl conservation planning.   This project identified the relationship between SAV, salinity, and other environmental variables as a first step in understanding how sea-level rise might affect food availability for waterfowl. The study examined coastal marshes of the northern Gulf of Mexico from Mobile Bay, AL, to the Nueces River, TX. Researchers compared SAV distribution and composition across a range of salinity levels, and found that water depth and salinity were the primary factors in determining the amount of SAV resources in a particular marsh. Surprisingly, researchers also found that brackish marsh tended to produce quantities of SAV waterfowl food resources similar to those in fresh marsh environments. The study also found some evidence that saline marshes contain less waterfowl food resources than brackish, intermediate, and fresh marshes.   This work will directly benefit efforts of the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, Gulf Coast Prairies Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC), and Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCC in forecasting the effects of sea-level rise on the distribution, abundance, and diversity of SAV resources and the priority fish and wildlife populations that depend upon them.

Average annual precipitation is less than 10 inches in northwest New Mexico but can exceed 60 inches further east in Louisiana. Much of the region relies on warm-season convective precipitation \u2013 that is, highly localized brief but intense periods of rainfall that are common in the summer. This type of precipitation is a significant driver of climate and ecosystem function in the region, but it is also notoriously difficult to predict since it occurs at such small spatial and temporal scales. While global climate models are helpful for understanding and predicting large-scale precipitation trends, they often do not capture many of the smaller atmospheric and earth surface processes that influence local and regional precipitation trends, like convective precipitation.  To address this gap in climate modeling capabilities, researchers developed regional climate models that are better able to project small-scale precipitation patterns and localized extreme precipitation events. Researchers combined information about land surface and water conditions with weather and climate models in order to quantify the local-scale impacts of climate on water resources. This highly localized information is expected to assist regional decision-makers in addressing the challenge of predicting precipitation in the South Central U.S., leading to a better understanding of potential future impacts on agriculture, fish and wildlife, water quality and availability, and cultural resources.

Black bear, bighorn sheep, mule deer, and wild turkey are just a few of the species found in these isolated mountain ecosystems that rise out of the desert landscape. However, recent droughts have crippled these ecosystems, causing significant tree death. Climate predictions suggest that this region will only face hotter and drier conditions in the future, potentially stressing these ecosystems even further. Simple models predict that vegetation will move to cooler and wetter locations in response to this warming. However, species responses will likely be more complex than these models show, as vegetation navigates other ecological stressors such as elevation change and water availability.  In order to better predict how vegetation will move in response to future warming, a more robust understanding of how drought and temperature impact tree survival is needed. Focusing on three sky island habitats in western Texas, this project sought to identify the key traits influencing current distributions of forest tree species, determine the susceptibility of these species to drought and temperature, and develop fine-scale, localized climate projections that model future conditions for the study area. This information is meant to be used to predict how species might shift location in response to warmer and drier future climates, enabling managers to make more robust decisions that will preserve sky island forests in the face of a changing climate.

The study models the relationships between wetland plant community structure and climate in the northern Gulf of Mexico and identifies potential impacts of future climate conditions on these ecosystems. The researchers identify critical ecological thresholds and demonstrate that transformative ecological changes due to climatic shifts are probable throughout the Gulf of Mexico within this century. In certain areas, small changes in temperature or rainfall are expected to trigger large ecological changes and affect certain ecosystem services. Because coastal wetland ecosystems in other parts of the world are also sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, the findings of this research have global implications, helping to inform the management of these highly valuable ecosystems under a changing climate.

This project examined the effect of shifting climate conditions on 20 species of conservation concern in the South Central United States. These species, which include the black-tailed prairie dog and the lesser prairie-chicken, were selected according to several criteria, including their expected sensitivity to climatic change. Researchers examined where these species currently occur in order to better understand the environmental, especially climate, conditions necessary for their survival. Climate and land use change projections for 2050 and 2070 were used to assess the potential future distributions of conditions suitable for these species.  Maps evaluating patterns of loss of suitable conditions for the species were developed and incorporated into the publicly accessible New Mexico state-level CHAT (Crucial Habitat Assessment Tool). CHATs are being used by states across the western U.S. to facilitate conservation and project planning, and are useful to decision-makers at all levels of government. Therefore, incorporating information about the potential impact of climate and land use change on species distributions into this tool will ensure that this important information is accessible to managers.

Improving this situation requires a good understanding of river water and groundwater availability, now and in the future, as well as advantages and disadvantages of water management options to sustain these ecosystems. In particular, there is a need to determine how frequently river water would be available to provide minimum \u201cenvironmental flows\u201d, or the quantity, timing, and quality of water flows needed to support ecosystems and human communities, along the Rio Grande. It is also important to estimate economic gains and losses from using water for ecosystem protection instead of using it for other purposes.   To help provide a scientific basis for understanding these issues, the project researchers will provide scientifically plausible future scenarios of climate and river water and will conduct a systematic assessment of potential impacts to environmental water flows using state-of-the-art hydrologic and economic models. They will assess the impacts of different environmental flow scenarios in terms of changes in Rio Grande flow, crop production, and groundwater sustainability. Furthermore, the project will offer science-based insights about the economic cost of securing water for ecosystems by compensating water rights holders. The results of the project will be shared with water management organizations and interested stakeholders in the Middle Rio Grande Basin for their evaluation, feedback, and use in decision making.

They can filter a large amount of water, affecting both water clarity and water chemistry. Their shells provide physical habitat for other organisms, they re-direct necessary nutrients to the bottom of the water column, and their excreted material can enhance the growth of algae and macroinvertebrates. However, dramatic declines of freshwater mussels have occurred due to habitat loss, destruction and modification, pollution, and invasive species. One mussel species in Texas (Texas Hornshell) has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and several other species are candidates for listing.  Changes in precipitation patterns and extremes, such as drought and floods, can also be detrimental to mussels. Freshwater mussels are particularly sensitive to drought events because they are relatively sessile and cannot easily escape to wetter areas. Mussels can also be washed out of suitable habitat during flooding or become stranded in habitat that later dries out. Rapid weather shifts from one extreme to another, such as rainfall \u201cwhiplash\u201d (rapid wet-dry or dry-wet transitions) and \u201cboomerang\u201d (wet-dry-wet or dry-wet-dry transitions) events are therefore particularly harmful to these species.

However wildfire, which is becoming more common as temperatures rise, can disrupt the role of mountain forests in the hydrologic cycle. Uncertainty about the interactions between wildfire and snow-water, and how these interactions may change as climate conditions shift, impedes effective water resource planning in the region.  Until recently, there has been no method available to characterize the potential effects of forest fire on snow-water (water from melted snow) resources. This project will combine two newly developed models that will for the first time allow an accurate analysis of the effects of wildfire on snow-water resources, under current and possible future climate conditions. Researchers will focus on the Las Conchas Fire burn zone in New Mexico\u2019s Jemez Mountains, where approximately 156,000 acres were burned in 2011.

Here, we propose to extend this optimization model in three significant ways to support cost-effective conservation decisions in the face of climate change and drought. First, we will incorporate SC CSC-developed predictions of rainfall, runoff, and stream flows through the year 2099 into our hydrologic database. Using this database, our enhanced optimization model will enable decision-makers to visualize and evaluate multiple competing water use scenarios under future drought conditions. Second, we will use SC-CSC predictions of stream flows and temperature through the year 2099 to estimate the future distributions of 28 fish species of conservation concern across the Red River. These future distribution maps will enable conservation practitioners to proactively manage species projected to be at greatest risk from declining water availability. Third, we will extend our optimization model to enable decision-makers to explicitly quantify trade-offs between competing water uses and ecological outcomes under multiple use scenarios.

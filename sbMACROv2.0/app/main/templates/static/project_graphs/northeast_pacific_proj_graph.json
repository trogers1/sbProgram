Natural resource managers and scientists in the Northeast, as well as the Northeast Refugia Research Coalition, coordinated by the Northeast CSC, recently identified vernal pools as a priority ecosystem to study, and recent revisions to State Wildlife Action Plans highlighted climate change and disease as primary threats to key vernal pool ecosystems. Mapping out the hydrology of vernal pools across the Northeast is an important step in informing land management and conservation decision-making.   Project researchers will collect hydrology data over the course of a year for 70 vernal pools. They will combine this information with existing data on vernal pool hydrology, targeted amphibian species (e.g., wood frogs and spotted salamanders), and the ranavirus and chytrid diseases that impact amphibians. This project will provide a preliminary assessment of the resistance of particular vernal pools to changes in climate by (1) modeling key aspects of vernal pool hydrology (inundated areas in spring, spring-to-summer changes in water cover etc.) based on climate and landscape drivers, and (2) relating vernal pool hydrology to amphibian occupancy and prevalence of disease.

The impacts of this warming on aquatic ecosystems are significant in many areas, causing problems for fisheries management, as many economically and ecologically important fish species are experiencing range shifts and population declines. Fisheries and natural resource managers need timely and usable data and tools in order to understand and predict changes to lakes and their biota.   A previous Northeast CSC-funded project modeled lake temperatures to help state agencies in the Midwest understand trends in walleye and largemouth bass populations and predict lake-specific fish populations under future climate scenarios. These results have been extremely valuable for decisions and management strategies at the state scale, and this new project will expand these efforts and will focus on lake temperature products at the three spatial scales of most interest to state agency stakeholders: lake, state, and region (for Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan).   The project researchers will use a \u201chyperscale\u201d modeling approach that will build upon the multi-state modeling framework developed in the earlier project to increase model accuracy for high priority managed lakes. This approach will use all observations of temperature that exist for every study lake in the region and use machine learning techniques to uncover biases in models used for lakes with many observations. The project will generate an improved assessment of aquatic habitat for lake fisheries, and will provide estimates of contemporary thermal habitats to be used by state partners to estimate the distribution and abundance of ecologically and economically important fish species. Deliverables for this project include: 1) hind-casted lake temperature profiles (1979-present), 2) summary outputs from the thermal models, and 3) individually tuned lake models for managers to use for testing and predicting future conditions under different climate change scenarios."}, {"node": 2, "name": "Development of the Wildlife Adaptation Menu for Resource Managers", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2017", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59de6101e4b05fe04ccd39b8", "num_items": 1, "items": {"5e98b56482ce172707f6aa86": {"title": "Final Report for Development of the Wildlife Adaptation Menu for Resource Managers", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e98b56482ce172707f6aa86"}}, "summary": "The Climate Change Response Framework is an example of a collaborative, cross-boundary approach to create a set of tools, partnerships, and actions to support climate-informed conservation and land management.

Not only do wildlife and resource managers need the best available science, it must also be presented in a usable format with feasible options within the purview of an individual manager.  The research team is first completing a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed studies to summarize what wildlife-related management actions currently exist in climate change adaptation. They will then develop and test a \u201cmenu\u201d of climate change adaptation actions that are suitable for wildlife management in terrestrial ecosystems. This Wildlife Adaptation Menu will be modeled off existing adaptation menus for Forestry and Urban Forestry, and it will be designed to be used in conjunction with the Adaptation Workbook. In addition to a menu of adaption strategies and approaches, the scientists will also identify site-level tactics and develop case studies demonstrating the use and implementation of the menu. To ensure that information and tools meet the needs of managers, the team is involving and integrating input from wildlife managers at every step of the process.

This study identified habitat and forest characteristics that improve the resiliency of forest dwelling amphibians and other wildlife to climate change. Further, by studying a foundational species in forest floor ecosystems, the scientists can use the information to make inferences about rare and declining species.  The researchers studied multiple red-backed salaamander populations across the range of the species, which primarily occurs in mature deciduous forests across the northeastern half of North America. They found evidence that salamanders will be negatively impacted by warmer temperatures and drier conditions, both in terms of how well they might survive but also in their ability to move around on the forest floor.

There are two general approaches of downscaling: dynamical and statistical. Within those, many dynamical models have been developed by different institutions, and there are a number of statistical algorithms that have been developed over the years. Many past studies have evaluated the performance of these two broad approaches of downscaling with respect to climate variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation), but few have translated these evaluations to ecological metrics that managers use to make decisions in planning for climate change. This study uses maple syrup production as a case study for evaluating how these two downscaling techniques perform in terms of projecting changes in the tapping season. Maple syrup producers are interested in how climate change will affect their industry. Our results will give them a sense of the range they can expect for different aspects of the tapping season (timing of tap date, length of season, quality of sap, etc.).

Most efforts to assess the likely impacts of climate change on biodiversity try to rank species based on their vulnerability under changed environmental conditions. These efforts have generally not considered the ability of organisms to adjust their phenotype to the changing environment. Organisms can do this by one of two ways. First, they can adjust their phenotype via non-evolutionary pathways. Second, they can undergo adaptive evolutionary change. We used two interconnected approaches to evaluate thermal adaptation capacity in a cold-water fish species. 1) Using tagging data, we estimated thermal performance curves for wild fish. The curves indicate how fish body growth will respond to changing temperatures. 2) Using genomic approaches, we developed a unified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel for use across the species\u2019 range to examine adaptive capacity. This panel can be used for high throughput genotyping of individuals to understand genetic diversity, health, and potential for thermal adaptation. Additionally, with the SNP panel we provide a valuable resource to the community of researchers working on Brook Trout conservation and management.  The SNP panel will make it possible for individual datasets collected across the range to be standardized so that they can be used to examine both local processes and range wide patterns. Overall, our results help us understand how Brook Trout will respond to a changing climate.

The scenarios serve both to identify climate change impacts unique to each participating Tribe and to propose solutions for adaptation and resiliency that are relevant for each scenario. The scenarios can be used as the basis for motivating more extensive Tribal adaptation plans, justifying future Tribal adaptation/mitigation projects, and creating the foundation for more sophisticated collaborations between Tribes, other parties and the Northeast Climate Science Center that harness robust risk analysis, decision tools and modeling. The scenarios, then, serve as the basis for characterizing climate change vulnerabilities and the needed capacities to address them.

Throughout this project, researchers engaged with state and federal resource managers, tribal groups, and other maple syrup producers to facilitate the adaptation of maple sugaring to climate change and aid in preserving this culturally and economically significant tradition in the Northeast and Midwest.

This project sought to provide an example of cooperative landscape decision-making by addressing the conservation of headwater stream ecosystems in the face of climate change at the watershed scale. Predictive models were built for critical resources to examine the effects of the potential alternative actions on the objectives, taking account of climate effects and examining whether there are key uncertainties that impede decision making. Results provide decision analyses that are (1) relevant to the management partners in question; (2) emblematic of landscape-scale cooperative decisions; and (3) sensitive to the practical consequences of climate change.  The successful application of structured decision making (SDM) requires the involvement of resource managers at each step in the decision. By involving federal, state, local and non-profit management organizations, the PIs ensure that the decision outcomes are suitable for all involved. Though they may identify a decision which is not optimal for each management organization, species group, or protected area of a given watershed individually, collectively results will be able to satisfy the regional objectives for headwater stream systems.

We predicted the distribution and abundance of common tree species across portions of the eastern U.S. under alternative climate scenarios that varied in the amount of warming by the end of the century from 1.1 to 4.2 degrees celsius. We used a forest landscape change model to forecast changes in tree abundances and distribution in the North Atlantic region of the U.S. while accounting for climate change, succession, and harvest. We then considered a broader region of the U.S. and combined our results with results from previous studies to compare forecasts from three different modeling approaches for the Central Hardwood, Central Appalachian, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regions to determine the level of agreement among models.  Our forecasts for the North Atlantic region indicated tree abundances were affected first by succession and harvest but second by climate. We predicted an increase in Southern and Central Hardwood species and a decrease in Northern Hardwood and spruce-fir forest species under warming climates over the next 300 years. Our comparison of the three modeling approaches across the eastern U.S. indicated high agreement for many species, especially northern species modeled to lose habitat in coming decades. There was agreement among models for decreases in black spruce, balsam fir, northern white cedar, and red spruce, and increases in loblolly pine and some oaks and hickories. Agreement across different modeling approaches and different climate scenarios provides strong evidence of potentially important changes to forests in response to climate change. These results can be used to guide decisions about how to manage forests under climate change to continue to provide the benefits we derive from them.

Extensive portions of prairie have already been lost due to agriculture and urbanization, and as a result grassland birds have declined more than any other bird group in the last four decades. Now, climate change could exacerbate existing threats to these birds as temperatures in certain prairie ecosystems are expected to rise and extreme weather events, such as drought, could become more common.  The goal of this project was to develop a framework to identify demographic sensitivities and assess the vulnerability of grassland bird species to future climate change. To do so, the researchers developed a strong partnership among managers and researchers to understand how climate change might impact the conservation and management planning of grassland birds throughout the Northeast CASC region and identify potentially vulnerable species. Using input from managers, the team focused their efforts on two grassland indicator species of high conservation interest: Henslow\u2019s Sparrows and Bobolinks. They developed spatially-explicit and temporally dynamic species distribution models for these indicator species and evaluated the effects of past and future climate on their populations. Finally, they studied how weather and extreme events (e.g., drought and flooding) effect the breeding success of grassland birds across North America.  By incorporating information on future climate change, the project team has identified regions where Henslow's Sparrows, a species of increasing conservation concern, are likely to face unsuitable conditions for reproduction. In addition, they have identified areas that will serve as likely refugia for this species in the future. The researchers have performed the first-ever exploration of the synergistic effects of weather and grassland patch size, the most common currency of grassland bird conservation and management. They have found that large grasslands serve as an important buffer of extreme temperature and precipitation on grassland bird nesting success.

This work capitalized on a rich suite of long-term data from these ecosystems to document recent trends in these forests and their associated bird species and developed tools for predicting their future abundance under climate change. Findings from this work indicate declining trends in the abundance of spruce-fir obligate birds, including Bicknell\u2019s Thrush, across the Lake States and New England. In contrast, montane spruce-fir forests in the White and Green Mountains of New England exhibited patterns of increasing abundance, potentially due to their recovery from the negative impacts of historic land use and pollution. Despite these recent trends, long-term predictions of future abundance for the dominant species found in spruce-fir forests (black, red, and white spruce and balsam fir) indicated large declines in these species from across much of the northeastern United States by the year 2090. Several areas were recognized where these forests might persist, including high elevation portions of New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont and in large portions of northwestern Maine. An understanding of these future dynamics is critical for informing and prioritizing conservation efforts aimed at protecting these ecosystems and associated wildlife species under future climate change and speak to the importance of sustaining long-term monitoring efforts to assist these decisions.

For example, plants might be relocated to support pollinator conservation or the restoration of prairies. Some land managers, in an effort to be proactive in the face of changing environmental conditions, are also considering relocating plants to sites that are considered more similar to anticipated future conditions. However, moving plants can be ecologically and economically risky. It\u2019s possible that pests, pathogens, or contaminant weeds can be inadvertently moved along with the target plant material. In 2016, the noxious weed Palmer amaranth was introduced to Minnesota as a contaminant in seed brought in to improve Monarch butterfly and pollinator habitat. This fast growing weed is capable of reducing soybean yields by 78% and corn yields by 91%, and requires costly resources to fight its spread.   One factor that impacts the risk associated with plant movement is the distance between the source of the plant and where it is being relocated to. If the source is located near the translocation site, it is less likely to be contaminated with new weeds or pathogens. The goal of this project is to create a framework for evaluating risk associated with the movement of plant material. The first tier of the framework will describe the future condition of the species, site, or community of concern, if plant movement is implemented and if it is not. The second tier will assess the ecological risks associated with moving plant material. This will include identifying potential pathogens, weeds, and pests that might be associated with plants from different areas and could be inadvertently introduced during translocation, and evaluating the potential harm these species might cause if introduced. The benefit of such a framework will be to greatly reduce the likelihood of unintended introductions of pests and noxious species. It will also take into account the ability of plants to adapt to expected future environmental conditions in their new locations. This work will support a range of stakeholders, including private, state, federal, and non-profit land managers who undertake planting for conservation or restoration.   Once the risk assessment framework is complete, researchers will test it for prairie restoration. This project will focus on the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota, but the results will also be broadly relevant to grassland managers in the central U.S."}, {"node": 25, "name": "Refugia are Important but are they Connected?

One specific management strategy is based on the idea that in certain locations, climate conditions will remain suitable for species to continue to inhabit into the future. These locations are known as climate \u201crefugia\u201d. In contrast, other locations may become too hot, dry, or wet for species to continue to inhabit. When wildlife managers are considering protecting land for vulnerable species, it can be helpful for them to understand where these climate refugia are located, so that they can be prioritized for conservation.   However, most tools used by resource managers to manage these important places identify the geographic locations of refugia, but do not examine how connected those locations are to other refugia or how accessible they are to current species distributions. This project aims to close this knowledge gap. The main objective of this project is to provide a map of projected refugia networks at the end of the century for each of 10 Species in Greatest Conservation Need in the northeastern U.S. A preliminary list of species includes Canada Lynx, Saltmarsh Sparrow, Spotted Turtle, Wood Turtle, Bicknell\u2019s Thrush, Moose, Prairie Warbler, Cerulean Warbler, Blackpoll Warbler, and Virginia Rail, however this list will be finalized with input from stakeholders in the region. Researchers will identify locations of climate refugia for each species and then map how well each refugia is connected to the species\u2019 current distribution as well as other refugia.   This project will result in maps of well-connected refugia that will remain crucial habitat for wildlife given current and future changes in climate. This information will support efforts of the USFWS Northeast Region to assess habitat needs for several species under federal consideration for listing as well as other Species of Greatest Conservation Need. Maps of refugia connectivity will also support the prioritization of on-the-ground habitat management in the region."}, {"node": 26, "name": "Supporting Early Career Climate Communications and Networking", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2014", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/544e5d2fe4b024090688fce6", "num_items": 2, "items": {"5cbf4b1ce4b0c3b00664fe38": {"title": "Webinar: Leveraging Web-Based Platforms such as the Early Career Climate Forum to Enhance Climate Change Communication and Engagement", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5cbf4b1ce4b0c3b00664fe38"}, "5cbf358be4b0c3b00664fcf4": {"title": "Final Report- Early Career Climate Communications and Networking", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5cbf358be4b0c3b00664fcf4"}}, "summary": "The Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey have made it a priority to train the next generation of scientists and resource managers.

This can potentially result in mismatches or asynchronies in food and habitat resources that negatively impact individual fitness, population dynamics, and ecosystem function. Numerous studies have evaluated phenological shifts in terrestrial species, particularly birds and plants, yet far fewer evaluations have been conducted for marine animals.  This project sought to improve our understanding of shifts in the timing of seasonal migration, spawning or breeding, and biological development (i.e. life stages present, dominant) of coastal fishes and migratory waterbirds along the U.S Atlantic coast. Through stakeholder engagement and outreach across the Northeast region we formed an interdisciplinary working group that developed a regional synthesis of how the timing of biological and human activities were shifting in the Gulf of Maine. We also identified two high priority case studies to focus evaluations and deeper analyses of factors contributing to observed shifts: 1) anadromous river herring in Massachusetts coastal streams, and 2) nesting seabirds across the Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge. We used a combined approach of synthesis and modeling to determine the direction, magnitude and extent of spatial shifts, as well as identify data gaps and future research needs. The results pointed to complex and location-specific phenological responses to climate-linked variables, but capacity for adaptive strategies to minimize risks to species. Project results are anticipated to increase the efficacy of management and planning tools which can be compromised when target species experience shifts in the timing of life history events.

These lands have the potential to provide valuable ecosystem services, like wildlife habitat, nutrient processing, carbon sequestration, and flood-water storage, that produce economic values in terms of recreational spending, improved water quality, and decreased flood hazards. However, floodplain managers may need tools to help them understand changing conditions on conservation lands.  This project worked with floodplain managers to identify the information most needed to understand nonstationary conditions, and to develop tools they can apply to conservation lands to improve decision making. Through an online survey and workshop with managers, the researchers found that time, funding, and a perceived disconnect between research and management limited the ability of managers to use new scientific information. However, managers revealed that they were willing to partner with scientists to identify science needs and products useful for management decisions.  Floodplain managers agreed that metrics of water inundation, including depth, extent, frequency, duration, and seasonality are the most useful metrics to inform management of floodplain conservation lands. The research team used scientific models of flood inundation under different climate scenarios to examine these metrics for the lower 500 miles of the Missouri River to aid in current and future management decisions of conservation properties. They found that annually, climate change is estimated to increase the duration, frequency, depth, and extent of flooding. However, these patterns vary seasonally, with inundation increasing in the spring and decreasing in the fall."}, {"node": 31, "name": "Projecting Changes in Snow, Lake Ice, and Winter Severity in the Great Lakes Region for Wildlife-Based Adaptation Planning", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2014", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/529e2c12e4b0516126f68ee8", "num_items": 6, "items": {"5a5fb99ae4b06e28e9bfc506": {"title": "Long-term trends in weather severity indices for dabbling ducks in eastern North America", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a5fb99ae4b06e28e9bfc506"}, "5a55355be4b01e7be242bdb4": {"title": "Final Project Report: Projecting Changes in Snow, Lake Ice, and Winter Severity in the Great Lakes Region for Wildlife-Based Adaptation Planning", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a55355be4b01e7be242bdb4"}, "58e4f9eae4b09da679997ac3": {"title": "Ice, Snow, and Swamp: Managing Deer in Michigan\u2019s Changing Climate", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58e4f9eae4b09da679997ac3"}, "58e4f45be4b09da679997aa7": {"title": "Dynamical Downscaling\u2013Based Projections of Great Lakes Water Levels", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58e4f45be4b09da679997aa7"}, "58c3073be4b0f37a93ed9185": {"title": "Projected Influences of Changes in Weather Severity on Autumn-Winter Distributions of Dabbling Ducks in the Mississippi and Atlantic Flyways during the Twenty-First Century", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58c3073be4b0f37a93ed9185"}, "5a553984e4b01e7be242bdc1": {"title": "Dynamically Downscaled Projections of Lake-Effect Snow in the Great Lakes Basin", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a553984e4b01e7be242bdc1"}}, "summary": "Winter conditions have changed substantially in the Great Lakes region over the last 50 years, with the region experiencing rising temperatures, declining lake ice cover, and increased lake-effect snow. These changes have direct implications for economically important wildlife, such as deer and waterfowl. Deer hunting alone contributes $482 million annually to Wisconsin\u2019s economy.   The goal of this project was to identify how winter severity, snowpack, and lake ice could change through the mid- and late-21st century, and how species such as the white-tailed deer and mallard duck will respond. Because currently available climate data is at too coarse a scale to provide information on future conditions for the Great Lakes, researchers transformed these models from a global-scale to a regional-scale.    Using these models, researchers found that the region could experience substantial warming, reduced lake ice cover, and increased precipitation, with more precipitation falling as rain than snow, among other changes. Snow/ice cover limit foraging by waterfowl, thereby regulating the timing/intensity of migration and their distributions during non-breeding season. Reductions in weather severity could result in delayed autumn-winter migration for dabbling ducks, which would increase foraging pressures on wetlands in the Great Lakes region \u2013 highlighting the importance of protecting these wetlands. These changes in migration patterns could also lead to potentially significant economic losses in southern flyway states, as ducks may stay in the Great Lakes region during the winter months. The primary wintertime stressors for deer are air chill and snow depth, with extreme winters triggering population declines.  Changes in wildlife abundance and distribution can incur dramatic ecological, societal, and economic impacts. Warming may support expanded deer populations and overgrazing, while elevating infectious disease threats to deer. Annually in the U.S., 13.4 million people participate in deer and migratory bird hunting, generating $21.5 billion in revenue, with the hunting industry supporting 681,000 jobs.    Predictions of the future distribution of ducks and other wildlife in the region will help guide the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Ducks Unlimited, and other stakeholders in developing conservation and adaptation strategies for vulnerable species and in mitigating the potential economic losses that might result from changes in species distribution.

Coastal habitats also provide protective ecosystem services to human communities, which are increasingly at risk to storms and sea level rise under future climate change. Understanding how climate change will impact natural and human communities is a crucial part of decision making and management related to the protection of our coasts.   In a collaborative project between the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NA LCC) and the Northeast Climate Science Center, researchers compiled existing threshold information on priority coastal fish, wildlife, and plant species as well as coastal habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and Caribbean in response to sea level rise and storm projections. As the effects of climate change on ecological and human communities grow, the possibility of crossing tipping points or thresholds of viability increases the potential for rapid and possibly irreversible changes in ecosystems. Therefore, understanding thresholds related to climate change is critical for facilitating conservation and management actions, which could help to prevent more costly and possibly catastrophic effects in the near (years to decades) and distant (decades to centuries) future. The compilation of this information will help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how natural systems will respond to climate change and how land and resource management decisions could potentially help these species.     Researchers further compiled natural and nature-based approaches to restoration and management that benefit both natural and human communities in the coastal zone, as well as synthesized information on the suite of ecosystem services provided by tidal marshes, beaches and barrier islands, mangroves, and shellfish beds. This work will inform climate change adaptation and resilience planning and assist coastal communities that must weigh important tradeoffs regarding the benefits and drawbacks of green and grey coastal infrastructure.

Known as phenology, the timing of these events is very sensitive to changes in climate (and changes in one species\u2019 phenology can impact entire food webs and ecosystems). Shifts in phenology have been described as a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the temporal and spatial responses of wildlife to climate change impacts. Thus, phenology provides one of the strongest indicators of the adaptive capacity of organisms (or the ability of organisms to cope with future environmental conditions).  In this study, researchers are exploring how the timing and occurrence of a number of highly migratory marine animals is changing due to a series of climatic and ecological shifts. First, using existing long-term historical data series, they will determine the direction and magnitude of how migration, abundance, or other phenological factors have changed for marine mammals, sea turtles, and fishes that migrate into the Gulf of Maine on a seasonal basis. Because marine animals are inherently difficult to detect, the team will apply dynamic occupancy models to evaluate seasonal migration patterns and habitat use across multiple habitats in the Gulf of Maine region. The project team will also synthesize regional information on a key, ecologically-important prey fish, sandlance, whose timing and abundance is a strong predictor of the occurrence and behavior of predator species targeted in this study as well as a range of other regional fish and wildlife of conservation and management concern. Results from this component of the project will identify coastal fish and wildlife species that are relatively more or less able to adapt and thus potentially vulnerable to climate change; determine the likely primary drivers of those changes; and identify data gaps and future monitoring needs. Ultimately, this information will be available and useful for regional coastal management and adaptation decisions that will allow managers to effectively plan for the future.   In a second component of the project, researchers will focus specifically on changes in migration patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale. While shifts in the distribution and time of recurring life events are adaptive responses that may help species cope with climate impacts, they can also lead to changes in how species interact with humans. The North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered whale species on the planet. In the North Atlantic Ocean, ship strikes and entanglements with commercial fishing gear represent fatal threats to right whales. Recent reports suggest that North Atlantic right whale migration patterns have changed. Many researchers posit that shifts in migration are responsible for recent increases in the overlap between right whales and human activities, especially fishing. To help understand how changes in right whale movements and behaviors may overlap with ship traffic, and thus put the animals at risk of encountering vessels, we will combine right whale habitat models with ship traffic maps. The end result will be a set of maps identifying risk levels.

To better anticipate these changes, there is a need to compile both short- and long-term stream temperature data for managers to gain an understanding of baseline conditions, historic trends, and future projections. Unfortunately, many agencies lack sufficient resources to compile, conduct quality assurance and control, and make accessible stream temperature data collected through routine monitoring. Yet, pooled data from many sources, even if temporally and spatially inconsistent, can have great value both in the realm of stream temperature and aquatic response. The NorEaST web portal was developed to serve as a coordinated, multi-agency regional framework to map and store continuous stream temperature locations and data for New England, Mid Atlantic, and Great Lakes states. NorEaST consists of a mapper where the public can view locations and metadata for current and historic stream temperature monitoring sites, a database where data stewards can store and manage their data, and web services to connect, communicate, and serve data for use in analysis and applications. Currently, stream temperature monitoring locations and metadata can be viewed for more than 10,000 monitoring locations across 30 states, contributed by 40 different organizations. Organizations collecting continuous stream temperature data can request to become NorEaST users and data stewards can use the web portal to store and manage their organization\u2019s continuous stream temperature data. To demonstrate the utility of large scale, consistent stream temperature data for use in regional analyses and decision-making, stream temperature data collected as part of the NorEaST project were used in three different targeted applications.

We sought insights by examining Lake Erie as a representative system with a high level of anthropogenic impacts, strong nutrient gradients, seasonal hypoxia, and spatial overlap of cold- and cool-water fish guilds. In Lake Erie and in large embayments throughout the Great Lakes basin, this situation is a concern for fishery managers, as climate change may exacerbate hypoxia and reduce habitat volume for some species. We examined fish community composition, fine-scale distribution, prey availability, diets, and biochemical tracers for dominant fishes from study areas with medium-high nutrient levels (mesotrophic, Fairport study area), and low nutrient levels (oligotrophic, Erie study area). This multi-year database (2011-2013) provides the ability to contrast years with wide variation in rainfall, winter ice-cover, and thermal stratification. In addition, multiple indicators of dietary and distributional responses to environmental variability will allow resource managers to select the most informative approach for addressing specific climate change questions.  Our results support the incorporation of some relatively simple and cost-efficient approaches into existing agency monitoring programs to track the near-term condition status of fish and fish community composition by functional groupings. Other metrics appear better suited for understanding longer-term changes, and may take more resources to implement on an ongoing basis. Although we hypothesized that dietary overlap and similarity in selected species would be sharply different during thermal stratification and hypoxic episodes, we found little evidence of this. Instead, to our surprise, this study found that fish tended to aggregate at the edges of hypoxia, highlighting potential spatial changes in catch efficiency of the fishery.  This work has had several positive impacts on a wide range of resource management and stakeholder activities, most notably in Lake Erie. The results were instrumental in the development of an interim decision rule for dealing with data collected during hypoxic events to improve stock assessment of Yellow Perch. In addition, novel findings from this study regarding spatial and temporal variability in hypoxia have aided US-Environmental Protection Agency in the development of a modified sampling protocol to more accurately quantify the central basin hypoxic zone, and this directly addressed a goal of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 2012 to reduce the extent and severity of hypoxia. Finally, the study areas developed in this project formed the basis for food web sampling in the 2014 bi-national Coordinated Science and Monitoring Initiative work in Lake Erie.

Although some variability in fish catches is expected across factors such as location and season, we know less about how large-scale disturbances like climate change will influence population variability.  The Laurentian Great Lakes in North America are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world, and they have experienced major changes due to fluctuations in pollution and nutrient loadings, exploitation of natural resources, introductions of non-native species, and shifting climatic patterns.  In this project, we analyzed established long-term data about important fish populations from across the Great Lakes basin, including from Oneida Lake in NY, Lake Michigan, and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Our objective was to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in fish catches from large freshwater lakes that have experienced large-scale changing conditions.  We evaluated analytical approaches with the potential to disentangle sources of variability in standardized monitoring data.  Specifically, we considered 1) how the decomposition of spatial and temporal variation in fish catches can be used to measure a response to perturbation; 2) how truncation of population age structure can alter population oscillations which may shift how a population is affected by environmental fluctuations; and 3) how the composition of a fish community may respond to a suite of environmental drivers through time. Using long-term gill-net data for walleye, we found that average catch and variance structure differed before and after large-scale perturbations. More generally, our results suggest that fish population responses to changing environments can be complex, but that long-term monitoring combined with modeling approaches can allow for detection of quantifiable changes."}, {"node": 40, "name": "Science to Examine the Interactions Between Climate, Agriculture, and Water Quality", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2012", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/51826b32e4b04bbc6ead2728", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "The purpose of the project was to conduct an extensive search for compelted and ongoing research that deals with climate change and agriculture in the context of water quality, for the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie and Big Rivers Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) and the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes LCC.

One portion of the search dealt with an online literature search for published peer-reviewed articles for the period of approximately 2000 to present. The second portion of the search dealt with contacting US Geological Survey (USGS) Water Science Centers and state institutions to request information on current research projects dealing with this topic that have not yet been published or are currently in publication. Geographic location was considered during the search, and only projects and publications taking place within one of the LCC\u2019s were acquired. The two LCC\u2019s cover partial states in some cases, but searches were conducted for the state as a whole if any portion of the state fell within one of the two LCC's. In addition, relevant publications were obtained for southern Ontario, Canada. An outline for search methodology, including sources and keywords, was used to keep the search process consistent and well-documented. In addition, manual filtering of results was required to ensure that they were both contextually and geographically relevant.  While the effort is likely not entirely exhaustive, the methodology entailed a progression of searches using multiple search engines and resources that upon completion did not return any results that had not already been acquired. The software tool EndNote was selected for compiling the database as this tool assisted in streamlining the process of publication retrieval during the literature search. It also standardized the way in which publications were recorded and provided a means to organize, reduce redundancy, and search the database. The resulting products for each LCC were aggregated to produce one final EndNote library. The library was categorized by geographic location but can be categorized using various criteria and keyword searches within EndNote. Through cooperation with the Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA), a searchable format geared toward the general end-user can be generated.

Therefore, sea-level rise and the associated changes in coastlines challenge both human communities and ecosystems.  Understanding which coastal lands will be vulnerable to sea-level rise is critical for policy makers, land-use planners, and coastal residents. Focusing on the coastal region from Virginia to Maine, researchers examined a range of different possible sea-level rise scenarios, combined with information on features of the coastal landscape (such as elevation and land cover type), to forecast which coastal areas would likely flood, and which would likely change or move as a result of sea-level rise. Researchers found that 70 percent of the Northeast U.S. Atlantic Coast has the capacity to change over the next several decades in response to rising seas.  Knowing where coastal habitats are likely to be resilient, where they will likely change, and where they might flood as a result of sea-level rise is essential for developing management and resource allocation strategies that preserve coastal areas. By distinguishing the response of coastlines to different sea-level rise scenarios, the results of this project can inform coastal land management decision-making about how to best adapt human and natural communities to potential future changes to coastal areas.

In Hawai\u02bbi, efforts to conserve native forests have come into conflict with objectives to sustain non-native game mammals, such as feral pigs, goats, and deer, for subsistence and sport hunting. Maintaining stable or increasing game populations represents one of the greatest obstacles to the recovery of Hawaii\u2019s 425 threatened and endangered plant species. Many endemic Hawaiian species have declined and become endangered as a result of herbivorous non-native game mammals. Meanwhile, other environmental changes, including the spread of invasive grasses and changing precipitation patterns and wildfire regimes could further interact to alter the distribution and range of native plants.   This project will address the need to optimally balance long-term endangered plant recovery with non-native game management. Focusing on the islands of Maui and L\u0101na\u02bfi, researchers will map the distribution of game species and native plant species, then use these maps to identify zones that would be optimal for plant conservation, and others for game management. This analysis will take into account both the current distribution and potential future distribution of game and plant species, as climate conditions change. The results of this project will support both federal and state land managers in Hawai\u02bfi.

Sea-level rise will further exacerbate the impact of storms on island parks and refuges by increasing wave-driven coastal flooding, with consequences for ecological and human communities alike. However, most assessments of future conditions at coastal national parks and refuges consider only permanent inundation from sea-level rise and fail to account for the combined effects of storm-driven flooding and sea-level rise.

The loss of mangrove forests will strongly affect human populations on isolated western Pacific islands as they rely heavily on mangroves for food, such as fish, shrimp, and crabs; building materials; and fire wood. Mangroves also shelter coastal communities from the impacts of tsunamis and cyclones, are home to endangered species such as the Yapese monarch and flying fox, and remove and store CO2 from the atmosphere. In the past, mangroves have adjusted to sea-level rise through tree root growth and the accumulation of sediments from rivers and oceans, processes which allow them to maintain their forest floor elevation relative to sea level. However, in light of the projected acceleration of the rate of sea-level rise, as well as modifications made to coastal environments that impede their ability to respond, it is unclear how mangrove forests will respond to future conditions.   Identifying which mangrove forests are most affected by sea-level rise allows us to determine how to protect them today so that they can continue to support humans and wildlife tomorrow. Mangroves in the western Pacific contain some of the most pristine and productive ecosystems in the world, but very little data is available in this region to predict mangrove vulnerability or resilience. This project is building on an existing mangrove monitoring network created by the U.S. Forest Service, the USGS, and the Micronesia Conservation Trust in the Federated States of Micronesia to assess the vulnerability of mangrove forests to sea-level rise to inform management planning. Focusing on the islands of Kosrae and Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia, researchers will identify which mangroves are keeping up with sea-level rise and which are not, and then model potential changes in the ecosystems that could occur.   This information will then be shared with state management agencies and local conservation organizations on both islands, including the Conservation Society of Pohnpei and the Kosrae Island Resource Management Authority, so that managers can identify what can be done to increase the ability of mangroves to keep up with sea-level rise. For example, moving roads or bridges so that mangroves can migrate inland or restoring connections to streams so that sediments can be deposited onto the mangrove forest floor could both support mangrove resiliency. Meanwhile, mangroves that are building elevation and adapting to sea-level rise should be protected from deforestation and maintained in that state for as long as possible. Increasing or protecting the ability of mangroves to keep up with sea-level rise will mean that these ecosystems can continue their role of supporting subsistence economies and diverse ecological communities in the Pacific Islands.

For example, 61% of native flowering Hawaiian plant species are either bird pollinated or dispersed through ingestion by birds. However, native bird communities across Hawai\u02bbi continue to decline despite efforts to control predators and enhance habitat. These declines are, in part, due to the mosquito-borne avian pox and avian malaria.  Scientific forecasts of the impact of avian disease on native bird populations under various climate change scenarios predict severe declines and species extinctions in all remaining forest habitat within the next 50 years. While little can currently be done to mitigate the effects of climate change on disease vectors, recent innovations in mosquito suppression and eradication may provide new tools to control or eliminate disease vectors from forest bird habitat. State and federal biologists across Hawai\u02bbi have made mosquito control a conservation priority and are currently focusing on developing the Wolbachia-based Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) to suppress mosquito populations. This technique involves using naturally-occurring strains of the bacteria Wolbachia to cause mosquito incompatibility (where mosquito sperm and eggs are unable to form viable offspring) and infertility. Sustained releases of male mosquitoes infected with incompatible Wolbachia can help to suppress wild mosquito populations.  To meet regulatory approval for the use of Wolbachia and achieve successful suppression of mosquitos, key ecological parameters (population density, dispersal, and survivorship of the mosquitos) need to first be assessed. These parameters help to inform the number of Wolbachia-infected mosquitos to release as well as the location and timing of their release. This project will use Mark-release-recapture (MRR) techniques to gather information about mosquito populations in selected areas in Hawai\u2019i. The MRR process includes capturing, marking, and releasing a portion of the population, and then later, capturing another portion and counting the number of marked individuals within the sample. This sampling will both improve the ability to detect and monitor mosquito populations and inform the use of IIT in the future for suppressing mosquitos. Results from this project will be directly useful to the conservation efforts of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office, and other resource management groups in Hawai\u02bbi."}, {"node": 60, "name": "Understanding Sediment Transport to Coastal Waters and Coral Reefs in West Maui", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2015", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/559eb2e7e4b0b94a64018fd9", "num_items": 2, "items": {"5914ac9ce4b0e541a03e9ad5": {"title": "Final Project Report: Mapping and environmental science to support clean reefs of West Maui, Hawaii", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5914ac9ce4b0e541a03e9ad5"}, "58213484e4b08f3b91767f13": {"title": "Data for Mapping and Environmental Science to Support Clean Reefs of West Maui, Hawai'i", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58213484e4b08f3b91767f13"}}, "summary": "Coral ecosystems of West Maui support a vibrant tourism industry and provide tangible economic benefits to the community. Hawaiian nearshore reefs generate about $800 million in annual revenue, not including the ecosystem services they provide - such as critical habitat for diverse fish species and buffering coasts from storm surges. The Hawaiian economy depends on healthy coral ecosystems, yet reefs are currently facing multiple threats, including changing climate conditions, local land-based pollution, and sediment erosion.  Erosion of soils into nearshore coastal zones is a chief concern facing land managers in West Maui. Intermittent rainfall can carry sediment from sources such as dirt roads, agricultural fields, streambanks, and disturbed forests into estuaries and the ocean. These sediments can block light that corals need for photosynthesis, essentially smothering them. Sediment also affects coastal user enjoyment by reducing water quality.  The goal of this project was to map, monitor, and analyze recent and historic rainfall to estimate sources of sediment for watersheds in West Maui. Researchers described how much sediment was entering the water from different land-based sources, to create a sediment budget for two watersheds in West Maui. Researchers found that current sediment deposition into coastal waters is likely due to the erosion of streambank terraces located downstream of former agricultural fields. These terraces are remnants of old agricultural land management practices in which soil and rock waste were pushed from fields into streams. It\u2019s estimated that this source results in over 90 dump truck loads of fine sediment entering West Maui\u2019s nearshore environment each year.  The information gathered from this project has already been used to inform a tool for estimating streambank erosion and sediment runoff into coastal zones during rainfall events. This tool can help resource managers and planners assess how different management options could help reduce the amount of sediment entering coastal waters."}, {"node": 61, "name": "Building Capacity for Coordination of Strategic Science Research in the  US-Affiliated Pacific Islands", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2015", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589a36bfe4b0efcedb71a61c", "num_items": 2, "items": {"589b5ee6e4b0efcedb72d31d": {"title": "An Inventory of Climate Change Projects in select United States Affiliated Pacific Islands (Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589b5ee6e4b0efcedb72d31d"}, "589b6384e4b0efcedb72d33d": {"title": "Preliminary Geospatial Data and Training Needs Assessment to Increase USAPI Capacity", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589b6384e4b0efcedb72d33d"}}, "summary": "Small Pacific islands are especially vulnerable to climate change.

Several climate-related factors are influencing Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s landscapes and contributing to these changes. These include climate change, climate variability, and drought (referred to collectively as CCVD). Climate variability describes how the climate fluctuates on a yearly basis around average values, while climate change describes patterns of long-term continuous change in the average.   While it is understood that CCVD will exert a growing influence on Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s ecosystems and communities, there is currently little information on the historic impacts of CCVD in the region. Improving our understanding of past conditions will help Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s natural resource managers better prepare for the future impacts of CCVD on ecosystems and communities. For example, invasive plant species in Hawai\u02c8i tend to be more fire-prone. If CCVD contributes to the spread of invasives, there may be more wildfires, and managers may need to revise current fire management strategies.   This project will use newly available datasets and tools to improve our understanding of the impacts of historic CCVD in Hawai\u02bbi. This information will then be used to assess the potential ecological and social impacts of CCVD, with an emphasis on fire risk.

The goal of this project was to provide Marshallese agricultural producers with information and resources that will help them adapt their growing practices to changing climate conditions. Researchers are creating a living website that provides clear, actionable farming information displayed in a dashboard format. Users can find information in English and Marshallese about seasonal rainfall, winds, and sea level as well as agricultural calendars based on El Ni\u00f1o/ La Ni\u00f1a. The website also provides facts on traditional growing practices and timings, crop tolerances, and nutrition. Pages can be downloaded, printed, and distributed by local agricultural extension services.  This project was implemented by Marshallese partners at the Ministry of Resources and Development, College of the Marshall Islands, and Land Grant program, and external partners from the University of Hawai\u02bbi, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service.

It is important to be able to predict how Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s streams will be affected by changing rainfall patterns to enable sustainable management of critical freshwater resources. However, to date, limited data and the uncertain effects of climate change have hindered predictions of future streamflow.  Through this project, scientists developed a model that provides a way to estimate future stream low flow (streamflow during a period of prolonged dryness) by categorizing streams based on their physical characteristics. While the model is based on data from gaged streams (i.e., those fitted with measuring devices to monitor streamflow), it allows researchers to also predict streamflow at ungaged (unmonitored) sites and thus develop island- or state-wide predictions of stream response to future rainfall conditions.  Researchers used the model to forecast flow changes in Maui streams under two possible end-of-century future climate scenarios. Results indicate that in areas where rainfall is projected to decrease in the future, stream low flow may decrease by more than 50 percent in some areas, and habitat for native species may decrease by more than 25 percent in some streams. The methods developed for this study can be transferred to other Pacific islands as well as non-island settings.

In many parts of the world, this decrease in temperature is a limiting factor for vegetation\u2014at certain elevations, the temperature becomes too cold for plants to survive. However in the tropics, moisture availability may play a more important role than temperature in determining the altitude at which forests can grow. For example on Haleakal\u0101, a volcano on the Hawaiian Island of Mau\u02bbi, the forest line is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. Rather, the forest line is highest in the wetter eastern-most end and lower on the drier, western end of the volcano.   Research also suggests that short-duration extreme climate events that cause changes in moisture, such as El Ni\u00f1o, can control the upper limit of forests more than long-term average climate does. This is because species found at the forest line are often already near their physiological limits, so extreme changes can have a big effect on their survival.    A strong El Ni\u00f1o occurred in Hawai\u02bbi in 2015 and provided researchers with a unique opportunity to observe how vegetation responds to ensuing climate variability. Researchers are focusing on Metrosideros polymorpha, a species of flowering evergreen native to Hawai\u02bbi. This species is the dominant canopy tree found near the forest line and will be used as an indicator for how the forest line responds to El Ni\u00f1o-driven drought. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to: (1) Observe the climate and ecosystem processes at locations near and above the forest line on Haleakal\u0101 during an El Ni\u00f1o event. (2) Determine how the ecosystem responds to changes in climate, such as drought, caused by El Ni\u00f1o. (3) Determine whether plant responses to short-term changes in climate and drought vary along the cross-slope rainfall gradient.

Already, high elevation areas have experienced rapidly increasing temperatures and there has been an increase in the frequency of drought across the Islands. These climatic changes could have significant impacts on Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s plants and animals. Changes in temperature and moisture may make current habitat no longer suitable for some species, and could allow invasive species to spread into new areas.   Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park is home to 23 species of endangered vascular plants and 15 species of endangered trees. Understanding how climate change may impact the park\u2019s plants is vital for their long-term survival. This project was designed to assist managers of Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park in preparing for a changing climate by identifying how plant distributions within the park may shift under future climate conditions. Researchers focused on the park\u2019s Special Ecological Areas \u2013 sites of critical importance roughly configured to protect representative plant communities and important species by controlling the most invasive incipient plants and animals. Researchers aimed to identify how plants may migrate to new locations and contract from current locations as species distributions respond to habitat suitability under future climate conditions, and map future plant species ranges. This information will then be used resource managers to determine whether the boundaries of the Special Ecological Areas need to be adjusted to account for future shifts in plant ranges.   Information on how climate change may alter plant distributions, including those of endangered and culturally-significant species, is required for effective management of the park\u2019s ecosystems into the future. The results of this project can help park managers overcome one of the greatest hurdles facing resource managers today \u2013 developing climate adaptation strategies in the face of an uncertain future."}, {"node": 74, "name": "Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2012", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/50118f9fe4b0d78fd4e59ba6", "num_items": 5, "items": {"57ec5fbce4b090825010b908": {"title": "Predicted climate and avian malaria risk to Hawaiian honeycreepers on the Island of Hawaii from 2098-2100", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57ec5fbce4b090825010b908"}, "563a3bd1e4b0d6133fe733c5": {"title": "Will a warmer and wetter future cause extinction of native Hawaiian forest birds?", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/563a3bd1e4b0d6133fe733c5"}, "5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025": {"title": "Final Project Report for \"Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation\"", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025"}, "5894fdaae4b0fa1e59b86a32": {"title": "Project Snapshot: Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5894fdaae4b0fa1e59b86a32"}, "5877a9d9e4b0315b4c120031": {"title": "Mitigating Future Avian Malaria Threats to Hawaiian Forest Birds from Climate Change", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5877a9d9e4b0315b4c120031"}}, "summary": " The Hawaiian Islands are home to some of the world\u2019s most culturally valuable but imperiled forest birds, including brightly colored native honeycreepers, many of which are threatened or endangered. One of the major threats these birds face is avian malaria, which is spread by a species of introduced mosquito and can have death rates exceeding 90 percent. For decades, upper mountain forests have provided refuge for Hawaiian forest birds because mosquitoes (and thus the disease) could not survive the cooler temperatures. However, warming associated with climate change could change this. Scientists used climate data and an epidemiological model to evaluate the future impacts of avian malaria on Hawaiian forest birds as a result of climate change. Results show that over the current century, anticipated changes in temperature and rainfall will favor increased mosquito populations and their expansion into high-elevation forests. These findings suggest that without significant intervention and mosquito control measures, many native Hawaiian honeycreepers will suffer major population declines and/or extinction due to increasing risk from avian malaria.

However, to date, available global climate models have been too coarse in resolution to be useful for planning in the context of small, isolated islands.  This project produced the first-ever set of high-resolution climate projections for Guam and American Samoa, providing information on key variables of interest to decision makers such as rainfall, air temperature, and tropical cyclone patterns. Modeling results suggest that both territories are expected to become warmer and experience a higher number of extreme rainfall events through the current century. In addition, American Samoa is projected to become wetter overall, with a mean rainfall increase of up to 25 percent by the late 21st century, and Guam may be subject to a higher frequency of strong tropical cyclones. These data are intended for use by other researchers to inform hydrological and ecosystem models and, ultimately, aid local decision makers as they plan for climate change impacts and seek to reduce risk through effective adaptation.

The plant was once considered a conservation success, when active management led to a population recovery in the early 20th century. Unfortunately, silversword populations are now declining, and climate change \u2013 namely decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures \u2013 is thought to be responsible.   The goal of this project was to collect data on both silverswords and climate conditions to pinpoint the exact cause of silversword declines and to predict how the species will fare under potential future climate scenarios. Researchers aimed to identify management strategies that might help restore silversword populations. So far, results have shown that silversword populations have declined by about 60% since 1990, and that this decline coincides with lower rainfall.   The prominence of the silversword within the Hawaiian alpine ecosystem renders it one of the more visible examples of climate change-induced biodiversity loss. Identifying the specific climatic variables that are contributing to the silversword population decline will help Park managers determine which management actions will be necessary to protect this iconic species into the future.

Sea level rise threatens the very existence of RMI as high-end projections of sea level rise by the end of the century exceed the average elevation of these low atoll reef islands. Already, waves wash over Majuro during \u201cking tides\u201d when strong winds blow from the west across the broad lagoon, or when there are high open ocean waves. Flooding waves breach island shores in multiple locations and wash into homes, cemeteries, across roads, and into commercial districts. Over the past decade, there has been a widespread exodus of residents to locations in Hawai\u02bbi and the continental U.S. as life becomes increasingly untenable on these low sand and gravel islands.  In order for Majuro and RMI leaders and decision makers to plan and implement a strategy for moving forward, scientific information and geospatial data are needed to model the timing and spatial pattern of future flooding in the first and most vulnerable areas. This project team will use a digital elevation model (DEM), currently under development, for the Majuro Atoll to model sea level rise and develop flooding simulations to help identify vulnerable areas. The team will also collect topographic and bathymetric data on Majuro to extend the areas covered by the DEM to provide a more comprehensive view of future wave flooding associated with sea level rise.  In later years of the project, the team plans to utilize existing data on groundwater and collect new information on Majuro\u2019s water table to model and understand water table dynamics in order to simulate inundation of saltwater into groundwater due to sea level rise. A primary goal of this project is to distribute project deliverables and provide training in their interpretation and application to Marshallese government agencies to inform mitigation and adaptation.

Persistent drought is further affecting agricultural production in the RMI. Many Marshallese communities are already experiencing these changes and are migrating to larger islands within the RMI and to other countries like the U.S. to, among other things, seek alternative means of making a living and access healthcare.  The number of Marshallese residing in the U.S. has rapidly risen over the past two decades, from 7,000 in 2000 to 22,000 in 2010. There is also substantial internal migration, mainly from outer islands to the main atoll of Majuro. However, we do not know to what extent Marshallese people are already migrating because of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services\u2014nor do we know whether this migration can be regarded as a successful adaptation strategy. The factors triggering human migration are complex and often intertwined, making it difficult to pinpoint and address specific causes from a public policy perspective. For example, changes in ecosystems due to climate change can cause health problems or food insecurity, which may have greater consequences in communities with political, social, or economic tension.  Decision makers at local and state levels in both the RMI and U.S.\u2014for example those who design policy related to immigrant access to services\u2014need information to better understand the factors contributing to current migration and to anticipate possible future impacts of climate on human migration. Also, a better understanding is needed of how migration impacts livelihoods and well being in the island to which migrants arrive and in the areas in which they settle.  This research project will study the nature of Marshallese migration and its effects on migrants, themselves, and communities in source and destination areas. There are three central research questions:    \tTo what extent are climatic stressors, and their impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods and habitability, already driving migration in RMI? \tWhat are the impacts of migration in source and destinations areas? \tHow do migration reasons and consequences vary among different types of respondents?  This project will examine the extent to which we can identify direct and indirect links between patterns of human migration and climate events. As a next step, the projects\u2019 research findings on migration decision-making could be integrated into agent-based models that use projections of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services to understand which islands and communities are at highest risk and from where we can expect most migration to take place in the future.

Once it reaches the ground, rain can either run off and contribute to water flow in streams, or it can infiltrate into the ground and provide water for plants and recharge aquifers and groundwater. The exact route that water takes is controlled by many factors, including the duration and intensity of rainfall, the topography of the land, soil properties, and vegetation.   The introduction and spread of invasive plants and animals in Hawaiian forests, which alters the water-use and soil characteristics of ecosystems, can have large impacts on downstream water users. Increased demand and competition for limited water resources in Hawai\u02bbi has underscored the need for a better understanding of this relationship; however, relevant statewide data is currently lacking.   The objective of this project is to understand how expanding invasive plant populations and changing rainfall patterns will impact water resources in the future. Project researchers are exploring the differences in key soil characteristics that control runoff and groundwater recharge in managed and relatively intact native mesic (moderate amounts of water) and wet forests and in similar invasive-dominated forests. Primary soil characteristics of interest are the hydraulic conductivity of soils (ability of water to move through soils) and soil hydrophobicity (a property that causes water to collect on the surface rather than infiltrating into the ground). Data will also be collected on the canopy and understory composition in the forests and on disturbances by invasive animals, like feral pigs. Results from the study will be presented in reports and maps of vegetation and soil characteristics across the Hawaiian Islands under current and future conditions.

During periods of drought, cloud-water interception, or fog drip (the process by which water droplets accumulate on the leaves and branches of plants and then drip to the ground) in Hawai\u2018i\u2019s rain forests may play an important role in providing moisture for plants, reducing wildfire risk within the fog zone, and contributing to groundwater recharge (the process by which water moves downward from the surface through the ground to the groundwater table) that sustains water flow in streams during dry periods. Estimates of the changes in water availability during periods of drought are critical to Hawai\u2018i\u2019s water, forest, and wildfire managers and planners, as well as to agriculturists and ranchers for developing adaptive management strategies.  This study addresses this specific information need and will lead to a better understanding of the hydrologic impacts of drought throughout the State of Hawai\u2018i. Specific objectives of the study are (1) to estimate changes in soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge during periods of drought for current and projected climate conditions, and (2) to estimate the combined impact of drought and reduced fog drip on soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge.  The results from this study will inform resource managers of the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and the importance of fog drip in mitigating the impacts of drought. This study will also provide needed input for supporting science-based strategies for managing critical groundwater recharge areas and identifying areas vulnerable to wildfires. The results will be a great value to forest and water-resource managers, watershed partnerships striving to protect, preserve, and restore large areas of forested watersheds for water-resource and conservation values, and outreach agents seeking to reduce the threat of wildfire to ecosystems and communities by facilitating the sharing of fire knowledge.

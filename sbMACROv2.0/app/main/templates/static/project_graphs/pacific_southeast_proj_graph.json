Climate change will likely alter rainfall timing and intensity, but global climate models cannot capture the fine-scale dynamics of local rainfall, making future rainfall predictions for the islands uncertain.

Results suggest that Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s climate will become drier overall in the second half of the century, but this effect will vary considerably across the islands and by season. There may be an increasing contrast between wet and dry regions on each island, as wet areas become wetter and dry areas become drier.

Once it reaches the ground, rain can either run off and contribute to water flow in streams, or it can infiltrate into the ground and provide water for plants and recharge aquifers and groundwater. The exact route that water takes is controlled by many factors, including the duration and intensity of rainfall, the topography of the land, soil properties, and vegetation.   The introduction and spread of invasive plants and animals in Hawaiian forests, which alters the water-use and soil characteristics of ecosystems, can have large impacts on downstream water users. Increased demand and competition for limited water resources in Hawai\u02bbi has underscored the need for a better understanding of this relationship; however, relevant statewide data is currently lacking.   The objective of this project is to understand how expanding invasive plant populations and changing rainfall patterns will impact water resources in the future. Project researchers are exploring the differences in key soil characteristics that control runoff and groundwater recharge in managed and relatively intact native mesic (moderate amounts of water) and wet forests and in similar invasive-dominated forests. Primary soil characteristics of interest are the hydraulic conductivity of soils (ability of water to move through soils) and soil hydrophobicity (a property that causes water to collect on the surface rather than infiltrating into the ground). Data will also be collected on the canopy and understory composition in the forests and on disturbances by invasive animals, like feral pigs.

In many parts of the world, this decrease in temperature is a limiting factor for vegetation\u2014at certain elevations, the temperature becomes too cold for plants to survive. However in the tropics, moisture availability may play a more important role than temperature in determining the altitude at which forests can grow. For example on Haleakal\u0101, a volcano on the Hawaiian Island of Maui, the forest line is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. Rather, the forest line is highest in the wetter eastern-most end and lower on the drier, western end of the volcano.   Research also suggests that short-duration extreme climate events that cause changes in moisture, such as El Ni\u00f1o, can control the upper limit of forests more than long-term average climate does. This is because species found at the forest line are often already near their physiological limits, so extreme changes can have a big effect on their survival.    A strong El Ni\u00f1o occurred in Hawai\u2019i in 2015 and provided researchers with a unique opportunity to observe how vegetation responds to ensuing climate variability. Researchers are focusing on Metrosideros polymorpha, a species of flowering evergreen native to Hawai\u2019i. This species is the dominant canopy tree found near the forest line and will be used as an indicator for how the forest line responds to El Ni\u00f1o-driven drought.

We also investigated how decisions were being made and what barriers - if any - faced decision makers. To gain this insight, we conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with key decision makers and stakeholders and our findings emphasized the challenge of collaboration between individuals, governmental, and non-governmental organizations. We found discrepancies between groups on everything from objectives and goals, to how decisions are made, the barriers groups are facing, information that is used to make those decisions and where information comes from as well as differences in decision making timing and frequency. Agency managers had firm objectives while landowners/private land managers had flexible objectives that changed based on new goals, knowledge and information. In the same vein, agency managers said it was hard to change their management plans but landowners/private land managers said that their management plans were constantly changing to meet their shifting objectives. Agency managers reported that they had access to all of the information they needed to make \u201cgood\u201d decisions while landowners/private managers said that they wanted and needed more information, specifically better economic and growth data. And although agency managers said climate change was a factor when making decisions, landowners/private land managers said that climate change was not a decision making factor. To bridge the gap between the two groups and increase information sharing, a library of regulatory requirements, scientific data, personal experiences and fiscal information may be a way to align management objectives and goals.  Lastly, we developed a questionnaire that may be used in future research projects to evaluate how socio-structural drivers and the personas of decision makers influence their decision making.

Unfortunately, many of these ecosystems are increasingly under threat due to rapid human development, and management agencies are increasingly aware of the potential effects that climate change will have on these ecosystems. Natural resource managers and conservation planners can be effective at preserving ecosystems in the face of these stressors only if they can adapt current conservation efforts to increase the overall resilience of the system. Climate change, in particular, challenges many of the basic assumptions used by conservation planners and managers. Previous conservation planning efforts identified and prioritized areas for conservation based on the current environmental conditions, such as habitat quality, and assumed that conditions in conservation lands would be largely controlled by management actions (including no action). Climate change, however, will likely alter important system drivers (temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise) and make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain recent historic conditions in conservation lands into the future. Climate change will also influence the future conservation potential of non-conservation lands, further complicating conservation planning.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. As part of this project, researchers identified important thresholds for ecosystem changes and highlighted coastal areas in the southeastern U.S. (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, and parts of Florida) where relatively small changes in winter conditions could cause relatively dramatic changes in coastal wetlands. Results indicate that mangrove forest expansion will bring about both above- and below-ground ecosystem changes. The most striking and apparent changes will occur above ground as forests develop and replace grasslands. These above-ground transformations will increase carbon storage and affect certain societal benefits provided by coastal wetlands in the region. The below-ground changes due to mangrove expansion will be more subtle and dependent upon the marsh that is being replaced. The below-ground impacts will be greatest along dry coasts (Texas), where mangrove expansion is expected to result in greater peat development and soil carbon storage. That said, there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d model for what will happen \u2013 the type and extent of changes will depend heavily on the specific characteristics of the site.

We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100.

However, a lack of scientific guidance and information complicates these efforts.  To help address this problem, the SE CSC project team will work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PRDNER), University of Puerto Rico, and North Carolina State University (NCSU) on improving the application of downscaled climate projections to help advance the recovery and conservation of amphibians in Puerto Rico.

Maintaining connectivity between habitats is a key strategy for conserving wildlife populations into the future, and sound science is needed to inform conservation decisions.  Scientists with the SE CSC, in partnership with the South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative, assessed current and projected connectivity for three species that inhabit bottomland hardwood forests, a habitat of high conservation concern: American black bear, Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bat, and timber rattlesnake. Not surprisingly, the study results suggest that under anticipated climate conditions, there will be fewer connections for species to move between suitable habitats.  Moreover, the findings reveal that the connectedness of a future landscape will be species specific. For example, what may be sufficiently connected for a black bear to easily traverse long distances might well prove to be disconnected for a rattlesnake. This suggests a limited ability for managers to use the \u201cumbrella species\u201d concept to make generalized management decisions.

This process is recognized as one of the most pressing conservation issues in the Southeastern U.S. Habitat loss and fragmentation reduces the amount of suitable habitat available to wildlife species, divides wildlife populations and reduces genetic diversity, and interrupts important migration patterns; and climate change is likely to disrupt habitat areas even more. Maintaining connectivity between habitats and wildlife populations will be a key management strategy for conserving biodiversity in the region into the future.  Previous work by the research team modeled and mapped connectivity in the Southeast for three animals that inhabit bottomland forests, and showed where key connections in the landscape lie both currently and in the future. However, the researchers observed large variation in connectivity across geographical areas, time periods, and species. These results raised new questions about which connections are most important for management actions.  This project is building on this previous research with four approaches: 1) analyze consistency between this work and other connectivity efforts; 2) asses trade-offs between current and future connectivity; 3) extend work on the prioritization of core habitat areas and central points of connectivity; and 4) optimize the selection of sites for conservation action at the local scale.

We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming in as much as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100. We were able to develop good predictive models of how warming influences beneficial and pest insects for cities in the Southeast and across the east coast more generally.

In addition, by comparing our results to those we garnered from herbarium specimens (many insects can be found on herbarium specimens) we could show that the effects of urban warming match those of climate change through time. In short, a subset of pests is likely to get far worse with warming and this effect is likely to be most pronounced in the southeast.

To measure air temperature at biologically relevant scales in the field, ecologists often use small, portable temperature sensors.

The project researchers performed two field experiments to examine the accuracy of temperature observations from three commonly used portable data loggers (HOBO Pro, HOBO Pendant, and iButton hygrochron) housed in manufactured Gill shields or ad-hoc, custom-fabricated shields constructed from everyday materials such as plastic cups. They installed replicates of this array of sensors (11 sensor-shield combinations) at 5 different sites at weather stations located in open and forested sites. The team found that HOBO Pro sensors with Gill shields were the most accurate devices. Error in ad-hoc shield treatments ranged from 0.8 to 3.0 \u00b0C, with the largest errors at the open site.  They also deployed one replicate of each sensor-shield combination at five sites that varied in the amount of urban impervious surface cover, which presents a further shielding challenge. Results showed that bias in the sensors with ad-hoc shields increased by up to 0.7 \u00b0C for every 10% increase in impervious surface.  This study shows that, due to variable shielding practices, the ecological literature likely includes highly biased temperature data that cannot be compared directly across studies.

Natural resource managers and conservation planners can be effective at preserving ecosystems in the face of these stressors only if they can adapt current conservation efforts to increase the overall resilience of the system. Climate change, in particular, challenges many of the basic assumptions used by conservation planners and managers. Previous conservation planning efforts identified and prioritized areas for conservation based on the current environmental conditions, such as habitat quality, and assumed that conditions in conservation lands would be largely controlled by management actions (including no action). Climate change, however, will likely alter important system drivers (temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise) and make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain recent historic conditions in conservation lands into the future. Climate change will also influence the future conservation potential of non-conservation lands, further complicating conservation planning.

This work will support the conservation stewardship missions of both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service by providing science to inform management of lands along the Gulf of Mexico.", "items": {}}, {"num_items": 0, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/552bc2c5e4b026915857df2e", "node": 84, "name": "Conservation Adaptation Planning for Landscape and Climate Change in the Southeast", "casc": "Southeast CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "The Southeast is currently undergoing high rates of population growth, urbanization, and land use change while also experiencing climatic changes. These changes are and will continue to threaten wildlife and their habitats. Most existing conservation programs and activities, however, focus on maintaining systems in their current condition, or returning them to a historic state, rather than enabling systems to adapt to projected changes. Recognizing this problem state fish and wildlife agencies, together with US Fish and Wildlife Service and others, have initiated the Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS). This project will support the SECAS effort, which aims to develop a collaborative network of conservation partners, shared conservation goals, and regional strategies to manage fish, wildlife, and other natural resources into the future. To help accomplish these goals, the project team will evaluate existing conservation plans and expected land and climate change impacts, and in collaboration with the Southeast conservation community, identify opportunities to incorporate landscape and climate change considerations into state and regional conservation actions. Issues facing selected focal systems, including pine savannah, will be addressed through structured workshops and decision analysis processes.

Unfortunately, climate change may be putting the species at further risk. Sea-level rise, increased storm frequency, and changes in temperature and humidity could reduce the suitability of habitat used by loggerheads and other endangered sea turtles for nesting and feeding.   This project assessed the vulnerability of key sea turtle nesting beaches to climate change in the Southeast. Researchers examined previous records of sea turtle nesting locations in the Southeast to identify the characteristics of these beaches, then predicted the future suitability of these beaches for nesting based on projected climate change. Beaches on both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are expected to be very susceptible to change associated with sea-level rise, making it imperitive that we understand how these changes will affect the suitability of nesting sites.   The results of this work can be used to directly inform federal recovery efforts for the loggerhead sea turtle. Identifying locations where beach habitat will no longer be suitable for nesting will help managers determine what action needs to be taken to protect loggerheads, such as moving nests out of highly vulnerable areas. Further, some of the nesting beaches used by loggerheads are also used by other endangered sea turtles, such as the Kemp\u2019s ridley, green, and leatherback sea turtles. Therefore, this project represents a vulnerability assessment of coastal nesting habitat for multiple species of national conservation concern.

Many different organizations make observations that are relevant to understanding global change processes, but the data are often not easily discoverable by other interested scientists and managers. This project aimed to pull into a centralized location information about many of these observational networks. In this phase of the project, a publicly available web-based portal was developed that provides a means to discover, search, and connect to many types of environmental and biological data collected in the southeastern United States that are relevant to characterizing potential effects of climate and land use change on land, water, and wildlife.  The Global Change Monitoring Portal (GCMP) consolidates information about data resources from research and monitoring done by federal, state, tribal, local, and non-governmental organizations; it provides opportunities for discovery by users who are land managers, scientists, tribal and other leaders, decision-makers, and citizens. Data resources can be visualized and searched by categories of measurements made and/or by specific geographic criteria such as state, ecoregion, hydrologic unit, and Landscape Conservation Cooperative. The GCMP provides a mechanism to increase the usefulness of important data collection efforts by a broad range of organizations by making the data more accessible to users.

Even decisions that are supported by science contain some level of remaining uncertainty. In the context of conservation and wildlife management, the potential for uncertainty to influence decisions is perhaps most obvious when we think about predicting how actions (or non-actions) will have lasting impacts into the future. Our abilities to precisely predict future climatic and ecological conditions and determine the exact consequences of our actions are, and will remain, limited.   Conservation practitioners and land and wildlife managers must navigate these challenges to make science-informed decisions to advance conservation and adaptation of important natural resources.  The degree to which management objectives are successfully met can depend on 1) how critical uncertainties are identified and accounted for, and 2) effective communication among stakeholders, scientists, and natural resource managers. The objective of this project is to help facilitate strategic decision support and synthesize the state of the science related to communicating and using uncertain information in conservation decision making.  In February 2013, this project brought together scientists, decision makers, planners, and resource managers across universities and federal and state agencies for a workshop intended, in part, to identify research and strategic-planning needs for effective delivery of regional conservation policy, with an emphasis on providing science-based decision support in the presence of uncertainty and climate change.  The outcomes from this workshop, along with the products developed for the project, advance a decision-analytic perspective within the conservation community and will have practical use as decision support for conservation practitioners and decision makers.

Some projections estimate that future sea-level rise could exceed the average elevation of these islands by 2100. Already, residents are facing extreme high tides and 16 foot swells that flood the islands with saltwater, damaging homes and infrastructure and contaminating the freshwater supply.  Land elevation is the primary factor that determines the vulnerability of coastal areas to inundation. This project builds on previous work in which a 1-meter resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was developed for Majuro Atoll, home to the capital and largest city in the Marshall Islands. Researchers will use this DEM to map areas of Majuro Atoll that are vulnerable to inundation, based on different water level scenarios. For example, these maps can be used to answer the question of which areas would flood should seas rise by 0.4, 0.8, or 1 meter, and will represent the first detailed assessment of sea-level rise vulnerability for Majuro.  The results of this project will support assessments of how future inundation events could impact ecosystems, infrastructure, the freshwater supply, and agroforestry on Majuro Atoll. This much-needed information will provide government authorities and local community groups with an improved understanding of the types of actions needed to prepare for future inundation and an estimated timeline for when these actions would best be implemented."}, {"node": 1, "name": "Near-term Climate Projections to Inform Adaptation in the Hawaiian Islands", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2017", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59ef93fae4b0220bbd991181", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "Land, water, and natural resource managers and planners across Hawai\u2019i are tasked with making important decisions about the state\u2019s future.

In Hawai\u02bbi, efforts to conserve native forests have come into conflict with objectives to sustain non-native game mammals, such as feral pigs, goats, and deer, for subsistence and sport hunting. Maintaining stable or increasing game populations represents one of the greatest obstacles to the recovery of Hawaii\u2019s 425 threatened and endangered plant species. Many endemic Hawaiian species have declined and become endangered as a result of herbivorous non-native game mammals. Meanwhile, other environmental changes, including the spread of invasive grasses and changing precipitation patterns and wildfire regimes could further interact to alter the distribution and range of native plants.   This project will address the need to optimally balance long-term endangered plant recovery with non-native game management. Focusing on the islands of Maui and L\u0101na\u02bfi, researchers will map the distribution of game species and native plant species, then use these maps to identify zones that would be optimal for plant conservation, and others for game management. This analysis will take into account both the current distribution and potential future distribution of game and plant species, as climate conditions change. The results of this project will support both federal and state land managers in Hawai\u02bfi.

As a result, predictions of future inundation often underestimate the timing and magnitude of future flooding, because they are only considering one part of the picture.    The National Park Service (NPS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) need accurate projections of inundation and flooding in order to develop effective adaptation plans that can help avoid or reduce the loss of invaluable natural and cultural resources and costly damage to critical infrastructure in the USAPI. To address this need, researchers will model future coastal flooding based on different plausible scenarios of storm- and sea-level rise-induced flooding in Hawai\u02bbi and the USAPI. This effort will result in high-resolution (~10 m2) maps of potential future inundation at national parks in Hawai\u02bbi, Guam, Saipan, and American Samoa and national wildlife refuges on the islands of Maui, O\u02bbahu, Kaua\u02bbi, Moloka\u02bbi, and Guam. Researchers will also assess what the different inundation scenarios could mean for natural and biological resources on these islands. The results will help to reduce the risk and increase the resiliency of NPS and USFWS lands on low-lying islands and provide sound scientific guidance for current and future NPS and USFWS management decisions."}, {"node": 14, "name": "The Future Resiliency of Mangrove Forests to Sea-Level Rise in the Western Pacific: Initiating a National Assessment Approach", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2019", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d5ef403e4b01d82ce97cd1e", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "Sea-level rise will eventually flood and kill many coastal mangrove trees. The loss of mangrove forests will strongly affect human populations on isolated western Pacific islands as they rely heavily on mangroves for food, such as fish, shrimp, and crabs; building materials; and fire wood. Mangroves also shelter coastal communities from the impacts of tsunamis and cyclones, are home to endangered species such as the Yapese monarch and flying fox, and remove and store CO2 from the atmosphere. In the past, mangroves have adjusted to sea-level rise through tree root growth and the accumulation of sediments from rivers and oceans, processes which allow them to maintain their forest floor elevation relative to sea level. However, in light of the projected acceleration of the rate of sea-level rise, as well as modifications made to coastal environments that impede their ability to respond, it is unclear how mangrove forests will respond to future conditions.   Identifying which mangrove forests are most affected by sea-level rise allows us to determine how to protect them today so that they can continue to support humans and wildlife tomorrow. Mangroves in the western Pacific contain some of the most pristine and productive ecosystems in the world, but very little data is available in this region to predict mangrove vulnerability or resilience. This project is building on an existing mangrove monitoring network created by the U.S. Forest Service, the USGS, and the Micronesia Conservation Trust in the Federated States of Micronesia to assess the vulnerability of mangrove forests to sea-level rise to inform management planning. Focusing on the islands of Kosrae and Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia, researchers will identify which mangroves are keeping up with sea-level rise and which are not, and then model potential changes in the ecosystems that could occur.   This information will then be shared with state management agencies and local conservation organizations on both islands, including the Conservation Society of Pohnpei and the Kosrae Island Resource Management Authority, so that managers can identify what can be done to increase the ability of mangroves to keep up with sea-level rise. For example, moving roads or bridges so that mangroves can migrate inland or restoring connections to streams so that sediments can be deposited onto the mangrove forest floor could both support mangrove resiliency. Meanwhile, mangroves that are building elevation and adapting to sea-level rise should be protected from deforestation and maintained in that state for as long as possible. Increasing or protecting the ability of mangroves to keep up with sea-level rise will mean that these ecosystems can continue their role of supporting subsistence economies and diverse ecological communities in the Pacific Islands.

For example, 61% of native flowering Hawaiian plant species are either bird pollinated or dispersed through ingestion by birds. However, native bird communities across Hawai\u02bbi continue to decline despite efforts to control predators and enhance habitat. These declines are, in part, due to the mosquito-borne avian pox and avian malaria.  Scientific forecasts of the impact of avian disease on native bird populations under various climate change scenarios predict severe declines and species extinctions in all remaining forest habitat within the next 50 years. While little can currently be done to mitigate the effects of climate change on disease vectors, recent innovations in mosquito suppression and eradication may provide new tools to control or eliminate disease vectors from forest bird habitat. State and federal biologists across Hawai\u02bbi have made mosquito control a conservation priority and are currently focusing on developing the Wolbachia-based Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) to suppress mosquito populations. This technique involves using naturally-occurring strains of the bacteria Wolbachia to cause mosquito incompatibility (where mosquito sperm and eggs are unable to form viable offspring) and infertility. Sustained releases of male mosquitoes infected with incompatible Wolbachia can help to suppress wild mosquito populations.  To meet regulatory approval for the use of Wolbachia and achieve successful suppression of mosquitos, key ecological parameters (population density, dispersal, and survivorship of the mosquitos) need to first be assessed. These parameters help to inform the number of Wolbachia-infected mosquitos to release as well as the location and timing of their release. This project will use Mark-release-recapture (MRR) techniques to gather information about mosquito populations in selected areas in Hawai\u2019i. The MRR process includes capturing, marking, and releasing a portion of the population, and then later, capturing another portion and counting the number of marked individuals within the sample. This sampling will both improve the ability to detect and monitor mosquito populations and inform the use of IIT in the future for suppressing mosquitos. Results from this project will be directly useful to the conservation efforts of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office, and other resource management groups in Hawai\u02bbi."}, {"node": 16, "name": "Understanding Sediment Transport to Coastal Waters and Coral Reefs in West Maui", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2015", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/559eb2e7e4b0b94a64018fd9", "num_items": 2, "items": {"5914ac9ce4b0e541a03e9ad5": {"title": "Final Project Report: Mapping and environmental science to support clean reefs of West Maui, Hawaii", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5914ac9ce4b0e541a03e9ad5"}, "58213484e4b08f3b91767f13": {"title": "Data for Mapping and Environmental Science to Support Clean Reefs of West Maui, Hawai'i", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58213484e4b08f3b91767f13"}}, "summary": "Coral ecosystems of West Maui support a vibrant tourism industry and provide tangible economic benefits to the community. Hawaiian nearshore reefs generate about $800 million in annual revenue, not including the ecosystem services they provide - such as critical habitat for diverse fish species and buffering coasts from storm surges. The Hawaiian economy depends on healthy coral ecosystems, yet reefs are currently facing multiple threats, including changing climate conditions, local land-based pollution, and sediment erosion.  Erosion of soils into nearshore coastal zones is a chief concern facing land managers in West Maui. Intermittent rainfall can carry sediment from sources such as dirt roads, agricultural fields, streambanks, and disturbed forests into estuaries and the ocean. These sediments can block light that corals need for photosynthesis, essentially smothering them. Sediment also affects coastal user enjoyment by reducing water quality.  The goal of this project was to map, monitor, and analyze recent and historic rainfall to estimate sources of sediment for watersheds in West Maui. Researchers described how much sediment was entering the water from different land-based sources, to create a sediment budget for two watersheds in West Maui. Researchers found that current sediment deposition into coastal waters is likely due to the erosion of streambank terraces located downstream of former agricultural fields. These terraces are remnants of old agricultural land management practices in which soil and rock waste were pushed from fields into streams. It\u2019s estimated that this source results in over 90 dump truck loads of fine sediment entering West Maui\u2019s nearshore environment each year.  The information gathered from this project has already been used to inform a tool for estimating streambank erosion and sediment runoff into coastal zones during rainfall events. This tool can help resource managers and planners assess how different management options could help reduce the amount of sediment entering coastal waters."}, {"node": 17, "name": "Building Capacity for Coordination of Strategic Science Research in the  US-Affiliated Pacific Islands", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2015", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589a36bfe4b0efcedb71a61c", "num_items": 2, "items": {"589b5ee6e4b0efcedb72d31d": {"title": "An Inventory of Climate Change Projects in select United States Affiliated Pacific Islands (Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589b5ee6e4b0efcedb72d31d"}, "589b6384e4b0efcedb72d33d": {"title": "Preliminary Geospatial Data and Training Needs Assessment to Increase USAPI Capacity", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589b6384e4b0efcedb72d33d"}}, "summary": "Small Pacific islands are especially vulnerable to climate change.

These include climate change, climate variability, and drought (referred to collectively as CCVD). Climate variability describes how the climate fluctuates on a yearly basis around average values, while climate change describes patterns of long-term continuous change in the average.   While it is understood that CCVD will exert a growing influence on Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s ecosystems and communities, there is currently little information on the historic impacts of CCVD in the region.

The Hawai\u02bbi Department of Land and Natural Resources, local planning departments, and other coastal management agencies are using this project\u2019s data and maps for hazard preparedness and adaptation planning on state and local scales. Results were incorporated into a statewide study of shoreline sea-level rise vulnerability led by the Hawai\u02bbi State Interagency Climate Adaptation Committee. While this study focused on Kaua\u02bbi, it established a methodology for predicting future beach erosion that is now being applied to other areas of the state to improve coastal management decision making.

The Marshallese have a long tradition of interplanting food-producing trees such as coconuts, breadfruit, and pandanus with bananas and root and vegetable crops. Locally grown food crops support community self-sufficiency, promote good nutrition, and can also serve as windbreaks and stabilize shorelines to lessen storm damage and erosion. However, climate change is posing serious challenges for growers, as they struggle to adapt to climate impacts including saltwater intrusion, changing precipitation and temperature patterns, and the spread of invasive species.  The goal of this project was to provide Marshallese agricultural producers with information and resources that will help them adapt their growing practices to changing climate conditions. Researchers are creating a living website that provides clear, actionable farming information displayed in a dashboard format. Users can find information in English and Marshallese about seasonal rainfall, winds, and sea level as well as agricultural calendars based on El Ni\u00f1o/ La Ni\u00f1a. The website also provides facts on traditional growing practices and timings, crop tolerances, and nutrition. Pages can be downloaded, printed, and distributed by local agricultural extension services.  This project was implemented by Marshallese partners at the Ministry of Resources and Development, College of the Marshall Islands, and Land Grant program, and external partners from the University of Hawai\u02bbi, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service.

It is important to be able to predict how Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s streams will be affected by changing rainfall patterns to enable sustainable management of critical freshwater resources. However, to date, limited data and the uncertain effects of climate change have hindered predictions of future streamflow.  Through this project, scientists developed a model that provides a way to estimate future stream low flow (streamflow during a period of prolonged dryness) by categorizing streams based on their physical characteristics. While the model is based on data from gaged streams (i.e., those fitted with measuring devices to monitor streamflow), it allows researchers to also predict streamflow at ungaged (unmonitored) sites and thus develop island- or state-wide predictions of stream response to future rainfall conditions.  Researchers used the model to forecast flow changes in Maui streams under two possible end-of-century future climate scenarios. Results indicate that in areas where rainfall is projected to decrease in the future, stream low flow may decrease by more than 50 percent in some areas, and habitat for native species may decrease by more than 25 percent in some streams. The methods developed for this study can be transferred to other Pacific islands as well as non-island settings.

In many parts of the world, this decrease in temperature is a limiting factor for vegetation\u2014at certain elevations, the temperature becomes too cold for plants to survive. However in the tropics, moisture availability may play a more important role than temperature in determining the altitude at which forests can grow. For example on Haleakal\u0101, a volcano on the Hawaiian Island of Mau\u02bbi, the forest line is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. Rather, the forest line is highest in the wetter eastern-most end and lower on the drier, western end of the volcano.   Research also suggests that short-duration extreme climate events that cause changes in moisture, such as El Ni\u00f1o, can control the upper limit of forests more than long-term average climate does. This is because species found at the forest line are often already near their physiological limits, so extreme changes can have a big effect on their survival.    A strong El Ni\u00f1o occurred in Hawai\u02bbi in 2015 and provided researchers with a unique opportunity to observe how vegetation responds to ensuing climate variability. Researchers are focusing on Metrosideros polymorpha, a species of flowering evergreen native to Hawai\u02bbi. This species is the dominant canopy tree found near the forest line and will be used as an indicator for how the forest line responds to El Ni\u00f1o-driven drought. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to: (1) Observe the climate and ecosystem processes at locations near and above the forest line on Haleakal\u0101 during an El Ni\u00f1o event. (2) Determine how the ecosystem responds to changes in climate, such as drought, caused by El Ni\u00f1o. (3) Determine whether plant responses to short-term changes in climate and drought vary along the cross-slope rainfall gradient.

Already, high elevation areas have experienced rapidly increasing temperatures and there has been an increase in the frequency of drought across the Islands. These climatic changes could have significant impacts on Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s plants and animals. Changes in temperature and moisture may make current habitat no longer suitable for some species, and could allow invasive species to spread into new areas.   Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park is home to 23 species of endangered vascular plants and 15 species of endangered trees. Understanding how climate change may impact the park\u2019s plants is vital for their long-term survival. This project was designed to assist managers of Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park in preparing for a changing climate by identifying how plant distributions within the park may shift under future climate conditions. Researchers focused on the park\u2019s Special Ecological Areas \u2013 sites of critical importance roughly configured to protect representative plant communities and important species by controlling the most invasive incipient plants and animals. Researchers aimed to identify how plants may migrate to new locations and contract from current locations as species distributions respond to habitat suitability under future climate conditions, and map future plant species ranges. This information will then be used resource managers to determine whether the boundaries of the Special Ecological Areas need to be adjusted to account for future shifts in plant ranges.   Information on how climate change may alter plant distributions, including those of endangered and culturally-significant species, is required for effective management of the park\u2019s ecosystems into the future. The results of this project can help park managers overcome one of the greatest hurdles facing resource managers today \u2013 developing climate adaptation strategies in the face of an uncertain future."}, {"node": 30, "name": "Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2012", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/50118f9fe4b0d78fd4e59ba6", "num_items": 5, "items": {"57ec5fbce4b090825010b908": {"title": "Predicted climate and avian malaria risk to Hawaiian honeycreepers on the Island of Hawaii from 2098-2100", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57ec5fbce4b090825010b908"}, "563a3bd1e4b0d6133fe733c5": {"title": "Will a warmer and wetter future cause extinction of native Hawaiian forest birds?", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/563a3bd1e4b0d6133fe733c5"}, "5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025": {"title": "Final Project Report for \"Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation\"", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025"}, "5894fdaae4b0fa1e59b86a32": {"title": "Project Snapshot: Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5894fdaae4b0fa1e59b86a32"}, "5877a9d9e4b0315b4c120031": {"title": "Mitigating Future Avian Malaria Threats to Hawaiian Forest Birds from Climate Change", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5877a9d9e4b0315b4c120031"}}, "summary": " The Hawaiian Islands are home to some of the world\u2019s most culturally valuable but imperiled forest birds, including brightly colored native honeycreepers, many of which are threatened or endangered. One of the major threats these birds face is avian malaria, which is spread by a species of introduced mosquito and can have death rates exceeding 90 percent. For decades, upper mountain forests have provided refuge for Hawaiian forest birds because mosquitoes (and thus the disease) could not survive the cooler temperatures. However, warming associated with climate change could change this. Scientists used climate data and an epidemiological model to evaluate the future impacts of avian malaria on Hawaiian forest birds as a result of climate change. Results show that over the current century, anticipated changes in temperature and rainfall will favor increased mosquito populations and their expansion into high-elevation forests. These findings suggest that without significant intervention and mosquito control measures, many native Hawaiian honeycreepers will suffer major population declines and/or extinction due to increasing risk from avian malaria.

However, to date, available global climate models have been too coarse in resolution to be useful for planning in the context of small, isolated islands.  This project produced the first-ever set of high-resolution climate projections for Guam and American Samoa, providing information on key variables of interest to decision makers such as rainfall, air temperature, and tropical cyclone patterns. Modeling results suggest that both territories are expected to become warmer and experience a higher number of extreme rainfall events through the current century. In addition, American Samoa is projected to become wetter overall, with a mean rainfall increase of up to 25 percent by the late 21st century, and Guam may be subject to a higher frequency of strong tropical cyclones. These data are intended for use by other researchers to inform hydrological and ecosystem models and, ultimately, aid local decision makers as they plan for climate change impacts and seek to reduce risk through effective adaptation.

The plant was once considered a conservation success, when active management led to a population recovery in the early 20th century. Unfortunately, silversword populations are now declining, and climate change \u2013 namely decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures \u2013 is thought to be responsible.   The goal of this project was to collect data on both silverswords and climate conditions to pinpoint the exact cause of silversword declines and to predict how the species will fare under potential future climate scenarios. Researchers aimed to identify management strategies that might help restore silversword populations. So far, results have shown that silversword populations have declined by about 60% since 1990, and that this decline coincides with lower rainfall.   The prominence of the silversword within the Hawaiian alpine ecosystem renders it one of the more visible examples of climate change-induced biodiversity loss. Identifying the specific climatic variables that are contributing to the silversword population decline will help Park managers determine which management actions will be necessary to protect this iconic species into the future.

The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) spreads over 29 atolls and has a population of over 50,000 people with homes and communities that may be threatened by these climate change-related events.  Policy makers, planners, and others within RMI are faced with decisions about how to prepare for the future and need scientific data and information about the vulnerability of Pacific Islands to potential climate change impacts like sea-level rise. Topographic and bathymetric data are needed to map out the overland and underwater formations that comprise RMI.  These maps can then be used to calculate and visualize potential effects and damage from wave inundation and other coastal hazards.  To help address this need, the Pacific Islands Climate Science Center is collaborating with the USGS Coastal National Elevation Database (CoNED) program to collect topographic and bathymetric data and develop a Digital Elevation Model (a 3D representation of the terrain) for the southern half of Majuro Atoll (home to the capital city and largest population of RMI) that can be used to visualize and project climate change impacts.

Sea level rise threatens the very existence of RMI as high-end projections of sea level rise by the end of the century exceed the average elevation of these low atoll reef islands. Already, waves wash over Majuro during \u201cking tides\u201d when strong winds blow from the west across the broad lagoon, or when there are high open ocean waves. Flooding waves breach island shores in multiple locations and wash into homes, cemeteries, across roads, and into commercial districts. Over the past decade, there has been a widespread exodus of residents to locations in Hawai\u02bbi and the continental U.S. as life becomes increasingly untenable on these low sand and gravel islands.  In order for Majuro and RMI leaders and decision makers to plan and implement a strategy for moving forward, scientific information and geospatial data are needed to model the timing and spatial pattern of future flooding in the first and most vulnerable areas. This project team will use a digital elevation model (DEM), currently under development, for the Majuro Atoll to model sea level rise and develop flooding simulations to help identify vulnerable areas. The team will also collect topographic and bathymetric data on Majuro to extend the areas covered by the DEM to provide a more comprehensive view of future wave flooding associated with sea level rise.  In later years of the project, the team plans to utilize existing data on groundwater and collect new information on Majuro\u2019s water table to model and understand water table dynamics in order to simulate inundation of saltwater into groundwater due to sea level rise.

Persistent drought is further affecting agricultural production in the RMI. Many Marshallese communities are already experiencing these changes and are migrating to larger islands within the RMI and to other countries like the U.S. to, among other things, seek alternative means of making a living and access healthcare.  The number of Marshallese residing in the U.S. has rapidly risen over the past two decades, from 7,000 in 2000 to 22,000 in 2010. There is also substantial internal migration, mainly from outer islands to the main atoll of Majuro. However, we do not know to what extent Marshallese people are already migrating because of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services\u2014nor do we know whether this migration can be regarded as a successful adaptation strategy. The factors triggering human migration are complex and often intertwined, making it difficult to pinpoint and address specific causes from a public policy perspective. For example, changes in ecosystems due to climate change can cause health problems or food insecurity, which may have greater consequences in communities with political, social, or economic tension.  Decision makers at local and state levels in both the RMI and U.S.\u2014for example those who design policy related to immigrant access to services\u2014need information to better understand the factors contributing to current migration and to anticipate possible future impacts of climate on human migration. Also, a better understanding is needed of how migration impacts livelihoods and well being in the island to which migrants arrive and in the areas in which they settle.  This research project will study the nature of Marshallese migration and its effects on migrants, themselves, and communities in source and destination areas. There are three central research questions:    \tTo what extent are climatic stressors, and their impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods and habitability, already driving migration in RMI? \tWhat are the impacts of migration in source and destinations areas? \tHow do migration reasons and consequences vary among different types of respondents?  This project will examine the extent to which we can identify direct and indirect links between patterns of human migration and climate events. As a next step, the projects\u2019 research findings on migration decision-making could be integrated into agent-based models that use projections of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services to understand which islands and communities are at highest risk and from where we can expect most migration to take place in the future.

Once it reaches the ground, rain can either run off and contribute to water flow in streams, or it can infiltrate into the ground and provide water for plants and recharge aquifers and groundwater. The exact route that water takes is controlled by many factors, including the duration and intensity of rainfall, the topography of the land, soil properties, and vegetation.   The introduction and spread of invasive plants and animals in Hawaiian forests, which alters the water-use and soil characteristics of ecosystems, can have large impacts on downstream water users. Increased demand and competition for limited water resources in Hawai\u02bbi has underscored the need for a better understanding of this relationship; however, relevant statewide data is currently lacking.   The objective of this project is to understand how expanding invasive plant populations and changing rainfall patterns will impact water resources in the future. Project researchers are exploring the differences in key soil characteristics that control runoff and groundwater recharge in managed and relatively intact native mesic (moderate amounts of water) and wet forests and in similar invasive-dominated forests. Primary soil characteristics of interest are the hydraulic conductivity of soils (ability of water to move through soils) and soil hydrophobicity (a property that causes water to collect on the surface rather than infiltrating into the ground). Data will also be collected on the canopy and understory composition in the forests and on disturbances by invasive animals, like feral pigs. Results from the study will be presented in reports and maps of vegetation and soil characteristics across the Hawaiian Islands under current and future conditions.

This study addresses this specific information need and will lead to a better understanding of the hydrologic impacts of drought throughout the State of Hawai\u2018i. Specific objectives of the study are (1) to estimate changes in soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge during periods of drought for current and projected climate conditions, and (2) to estimate the combined impact of drought and reduced fog drip on soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge.  The results from this study will inform resource managers of the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and the importance of fog drip in mitigating the impacts of drought. This study will also provide needed input for supporting science-based strategies for managing critical groundwater recharge areas and identifying areas vulnerable to wildfires. The results will be a great value to forest and water-resource managers, watershed partnerships striving to protect, preserve, and restore large areas of forested watersheds for water-resource and conservation values, and outreach agents seeking to reduce the threat of wildfire to ecosystems and communities by facilitating the sharing of fire knowledge.

The ecological implications and timing of mangrove expansion is not well understood, and coastal wetland managers need information and tools that will enable them to identify and forecast the ecological impacts of this shift from salt marsh to mangrove-dominated coastal ecosystems.  To address this need, researchers will host workshops and leverage existing collaborations with scientists across the northern Gulf of Mexico to develop products that are relevant to resource managers within this transition zone between mangrove forests and salt marshes. First, researchers will leverage a community-curated data network called the Mangrove Migration Network to examine temperature thresholds for damage and mortality for several mangrove species that are common to the region. The winter of 2017-2018 in particular, during which extreme winter temperatures were experienced in the northern Gulf of Mexico, presents an outstanding opportunity to improve our ability to forecast the effects of changing winter temperature extremes on coastal wetlands. Researchers will integrate data from the Gulf of Mexico Mangrove Migration Network to assess the vulnerability of coastal wetlands to changing winter temperature extremes. Second, three workshops will be held with managers throughout the region to identify issues related to mangrove restoration and management in coastal wetlands in Texas, Louisiana, and north Florida.

For the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make decisions about the potential listing of a species, they must be able to forecast a species\u2019 responses to potential future environmental conditions, as well as to different conservation and management actions. Yet, for many imperiled species in the pine rocklands, the information needed to complete these forecasts\u2014such as population trends, life history traits, habitat use, and future land use and climate conditions--is often lacking. This is especially problematic for assessments of species resiliency to changes in climate and land use.  When these types of data are lacking, information on habitat quality can be used to help determine how a species will respond to change. This project will evaluate habitat conditions for two species found in the pine rockland ecosystem - the rim rock crowned snake and the key ringneck snake. These species are being considered for federal listing, and very little is known about their ecology and demography. Researchers will identify potential future changes in habitat that could result from different management actions, such as habitat acquisition or restoration, and environmental conditions, such as changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms and rates of sea-level rise. They will then explore the potential impacts of these habitat condition changes on the rim rock crowned snake and key ringneck snake.  This information can be used to develop future habitat condition scenarios in forthcoming SSAs for these species. While this project focuses on these two species of snakes, the results could inform the conservation, management, and recovery of other at-risk species found in the pine rocklands ecosystem.

These changes have the potential to influence the ability of barrier islands to serve as a first-line of defense for the mainland during storm events. Gulf Islands National Seashore, a National Park Service unit in the northern Gulf of Mexico between Florida and Mississippi, is predominantly comprised of barrier islands and faces immediate challenges, including erosion that washes out roads and sand dunes and the adverse impacts on cultural and natural resources from exposure to saltwater. Managers require realistic estimates of both the vulnerability of the park\u2019s natural and cultural resources to these threats, as well as the likelihood of the potential harmful consequences of exposure to these threats.  The goal of this project is to support efficient adaptation planning of vulnerable coastal resources in the Gulf Islands National Seashore region, and to identify research priorities that will help predict future changes to barrier islands. First, researchers will implement an existing adaptation planning framework designed to assist the National Park Service in making effective cultural resource adaptation decisions under a range of budget constraints. This framework includes the use of Optimal Preservation (OptiPres), a model that considers the combined effects of the exposure of resources to threats such as storm surge, and the costs and benefits of various management actions taken to address these threats. Researchers will improve the model by developing better estimates of the frequency of storm events that would result in saltwater inundation of forts and historic buildings at the park. Researchers will also bring together managers and technical experts to evaluate the science-based information needs related to sediment dynamics in the Gulf Islands National Seashore region, and to explore paths forward for addressing these needs. This work will advance the Secretary of the Department of the Interior\u2019s priority of conservation stewardship by providing science to inform management of its natural and cultural resource at Gulf Islands National Seashore.

In order for managers to effectively plan for and adapt to future climate and land cover conditions, they require information on changes that could occur in the distribution and quantity of water resources. Yet every watershed has a unique set of characteristics \u2013 such as differing topographies and geology \u2013 that affect how much water is available, the sources of water, and how it flows through the system. This means that water availability in every watershed can be affected differently by changes in climate and land cover.  Flow can be monitored in a stream using a stream gage, which provides information about the amount and variability of surface water resources at a particular location. However, not every stream has a gage, and decisions about water resources in these ungaged watersheds still must be made. In the absence of measured streamflow information, hydrologic models can be used to provide estimates of streamflow characteristics. This project will use a modeling approach that groups watersheds that are gaged with watersheds that are not gaged to provide accurate estimates of water availability for all watersheds in the southeastern United States, under current and potential future climate and land cover conditions.

We sought to understand the effect of global warming on both beneficial and pest insects of trees. We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming in as much as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100. We were able to develop good predictive models of how warming influences beneficial and pest insects for cities in the Southeast and across the east coast more generally. We were also able to predict how tree health will respond to these changes in insect communities. In addition, by comparing our results to those we garnered from herbarium specimens (many insects can be found on herbarium specimens) we could show that the effects of urban warming match those of climate change through time. In short, a subset of pests is likely to get far worse with warming and this effect is likely to be most pronounced in the southeast. A second body of work built on these discoveries to consider how to protect trees and forests from the pests that do better with warming.

Unfortunately, many of these ecosystems are increasingly under threat due to rapid human development, and management agencies are increasingly aware of the potential effects that climate change will have on these ecosystems. Natural resource managers and conservation planners can be effective at preserving ecosystems in the face of these stressors only if they can adapt current conservation efforts to increase the overall resilience of the system. Climate change, in particular, challenges many of the basic assumptions used by conservation planners and managers. Previous conservation planning efforts identified and prioritized areas for conservation based on the current environmental conditions, such as habitat quality, and assumed that conditions in conservation lands would be largely controlled by management actions (including no action). Climate change, however, will likely alter important system drivers (temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise) and make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain recent historic conditions in conservation lands into the future. Climate change will also influence the future conservation potential of non-conservation lands, further complicating conservation planning. Therefore, there is a need to develop and adapt effective conservation strategies to cope with the effects of climate and landscape change on future environmental conditions.  Traditional urban growth models are very localized and data-intensive and lack the capability to be applied across large regions. In response to these limitations the North Carolina Cooperative Research Unit began using the USGS SLEUTH urban growth model to develop urbanization scenarios as part of the Southeast Regional Assessment Project (SERAP).

Unfortunately, climate change may be putting the species at further risk. Sea-level rise, increased storm frequency, and changes in temperature and humidity could reduce the suitability of habitat used by loggerheads and other endangered sea turtles for nesting and feeding.   This project assessed the vulnerability of key sea turtle nesting beaches to climate change in the Southeast. Researchers examined previous records of sea turtle nesting locations in the Southeast to identify the characteristics of these beaches, then predicted the future suitability of these beaches for nesting based on projected climate change. Beaches on both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are expected to be very susceptible to change associated with sea-level rise, making it imperitive that we understand how these changes will affect the suitability of nesting sites.   The results of this work can be used to directly inform federal recovery efforts for the loggerhead sea turtle. Identifying locations where beach habitat will no longer be suitable for nesting will help managers determine what action needs to be taken to protect loggerheads, such as moving nests out of highly vulnerable areas. Further, some of the nesting beaches used by loggerheads are also used by other endangered sea turtles, such as the Kemp\u2019s ridley, green, and leatherback sea turtles. Therefore, this project represents a vulnerability assessment of coastal nesting habitat for multiple species of national conservation concern.

Unfortunately, many of these ecosystems are increasingly under threat due to rapid human development, and management agencies are increasingly aware of the potential effects that climate change will have on these ecosystems. Natural resource managers and conservation planners can be effective at preserving ecosystems in the face of these stressors only if they can adapt current conservation efforts to increase the overall resilience of the system. Climate change, in particular, challenges many of the basic assumptions used by conservation planners and managers. Previous conservation planning efforts identified and prioritized areas for conservation based on the current environmental conditions, such as habitat quality, and assumed that conditions in conservation lands would be largely controlled by management actions (including no action). Climate change, however, will likely alter important system drivers (temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise) and make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain recent historic conditions in conservation lands into the future. Climate change will also influence the future conservation potential of non-conservation lands, further complicating conservation planning.

Scientific models provide resource managers with an effective way to visualize and understand these changes, but the numerous choices of marsh models currently available can be overwhelming to coastal managers. The similarities and differences in model capabilities and the resulting implications for managing coastal marsh habitats are not well understood. Furthermore, the model predictions have not been robustly compared to historical data, which is needed to assess the effectiveness in predicting changes in marshes as sea levels rise.    To address this need, researchers will work with marsh model developers and coastal resource managers to understand and provide guidance on which models are best suited for different types of management decisions.

This project investigates the potential vulnerability and adaptation of a native freshwater mussel, the Tidewater Mucket, in coastal river systems and offer solutions for its conservation. Scientists have recently discovered a population of these mussels in a reservoir along the North Carolina-Virginia border that have been isolated from their native riverine habitat and associated natural fluctuations in salinity for over 50 years. These mussels have apparently adapted to and are able to thrive in the relatively high temperatures, low flow, and low salinity of a reservoir environment, whereas their native counterpart populations located in the downstream portions of coastal rivers that have adapted to withstand exposures to salinity and altered flows, are declining. Federal and state resource managers would like to know how these native coastal plain mussel populations will respond to larger and longer durations of salinity incursions like those predicted with sea level rise.   This study will use mussels from both the reservoir and riverine populations to understand their vulnerability to salinity by conducting sensitivity tests under controlled laboratory conditions, determine the potential effects of natural riverine salinity gradients by conducting a transplant experiment, and develop risk-based visualization maps of mussel salinity tolerances in existing occupied habitats incorporating predictions in sea level rise and projected salinity ranges.

To measure air temperature at biologically relevant scales in the field, ecologists often use small, portable temperature sensors. These sensors must be shielded from solar radiation to provide accurate temperature measurements, but a review of 18 years of ecological literature indicated that shielding practices vary across studies (when the shielding is reported at all), and that ecologists often invent and construct ad-hoc radiation shields without testing their efficacy.  The project researchers performed two field experiments to examine the accuracy of temperature observations from three commonly used portable data loggers (HOBO Pro, HOBO Pendant, and iButton hygrochron) housed in manufactured Gill shields or ad-hoc, custom-fabricated shields constructed from everyday materials such as plastic cups. They installed replicates of this array of sensors (11 sensor-shield combinations) at 5 different sites at weather stations located in open and forested sites. The team found that HOBO Pro sensors with Gill shields were the most accurate devices. Error in ad-hoc shield treatments ranged from 0.8 to 3.0 \u00b0C, with the largest errors at the open site.  They also deployed one replicate of each sensor-shield combination at five sites that varied in the amount of urban impervious surface cover, which presents a further shielding challenge. Results showed that bias in the sensors with ad-hoc shields increased by up to 0.7 \u00b0C for every 10% increase in impervious surface.  This study shows that, due to variable shielding practices, the ecological literature likely includes highly biased temperature data that cannot be compared directly across studies. If left unaddressed, these errors will hinder efforts to predict biological responses to climate change.

The risks of significant negative impacts are likely to be higher in these island systems than in many temperate regions of the world because of the limited size of their land masses, high numbers of species that only exist in narrowly defined regions, and expectations that tropical environments will experience greater changes in temperature. Tropical island communities are faced with making important decisions related to adaptation that could impact the health of important natural resources and ecosystems. However, a lack of scientific guidance and information complicates these efforts.  To help address this problem, the SE CSC project team will work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PRDNER), University of Puerto Rico, and North Carolina State University (NCSU) on improving the application of downscaled climate projections to help advance the recovery and conservation of amphibians in Puerto Rico. The USFWS and PRDNER seek to implement an adaptive conservation strategy to achieve recovery of three endangered frog species (of the genus Eleutherodactylus) and prevent federal listing of 14 other amphibians considered at risk. Implementation of the strategy requires identifying suitable habitat for the species at present and in the future, and ensuring the availability of field-tested protocols for locally supplementing, introducing, and translocating species as necessary.  The main objectives of this project are: (1) to develop an understanding of the eco-physiological limits of these species and the influence of those limits on extinction rates in local patches (i.e., heterogeneous micro-habitats within an ecosystem), and (2) to assess their adaptive capacity (i.e. the ability of the amphibians to adapt to changing environmental conditions). This will inform implementation of the conservation strategy, which is partly constrained by the availability of conservation areas that meet required eco-physiological conditions. This research will contribute to a decision framework developed by NCSU scientists that can assist decision makers in determining when and where to implement conservation actions to maximize species persistence.  The framework incorporates ecological and socio-economic factors, multiple and possibly competing management objectives, and key uncertainties (related to climate and land use dynamics) in determining potential conservation strategies.  This project will incorporate results from an earlier SE CSC project, Modeling Future Temperature and Precipitation for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Caribbean, that laid the foundation for more reliable climate change information for this region by producing dynamically downscaled climate projections.

Cultural resources represent evidence of past human activity, such as archeological sites, or are of significance to a group of people traditionally associated with the resource, such as Native American ceremonial sites.   Climate change is challenging the long-term persistence of many cultural resources. For example, those located in coastal areas, such as historic lighthouses, are threatened by sea-level rise, shoreline erosion, and more frequent severe storm events. While climate change challenges managers of both natural and cultural resources to make decisions in the face of uncertainty, far less work has been done to identify the impacts of climate change on cultural resources, compared to natural resources.    To address this critical gap, researchers developed a strategy to aid decision makers in climate adaptation planning efforts. The strategy integrated assessments of the relative significance of specific cultural resources and their vulnerability to climate change. The strategy will be pilot tested with a subset of buildings listed on the National Historic Register at Cape Look National Seashore, located on North Carolina\u2019s barrier islands.   Cultural resources hold multiple and diverse values to local communities, visitors, and the general public. These resources are irreplaceable, and their meaning is often tied to their specific location. This project aimed to contribute significantly to our understanding of the vulnerability of cultural resources to climate change throughout the southeastern U.S. and the role that historic significance should play in management decisions\u2014information that is vital for developing strategies to conserve these resources into the future.

Recognizing this problem state fish and wildlife agencies, together with US Fish and Wildlife Service and others, have initiated the Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS). This project will support the SECAS effort, which aims to develop a collaborative network of conservation partners, shared conservation goals, and regional strategies to manage fish, wildlife, and other natural resources into the future. To help accomplish these goals, the project team will evaluate existing conservation plans and expected land and climate change impacts, and in collaboration with the Southeast conservation community, identify opportunities to incorporate landscape and climate change considerations into state and regional conservation actions.

The development of adaptation strategies that respond to anthropogenic climate change for the CLCC, and particularly for Puerto Rico, is currently hindered by the lack of local-scale climate scenarios that resolve the complex topographical and meso-scale climate features that will mediate the island-wide response to the global anthropogenic climate forcing. The research team proposes to address these issues by developing a suite of dynamically downscaled, nonhydrostatic climate model projections for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Caribbean region. The framework provides a unique opportunity to examine climate change impacts on island ecosystems in a region of the global tropics with a highly dynamic climate regime. The resulting simulations will fill a critical need for climate change information in Puerto Rico and the broader U.S. Caribbean by enabling future estimates of likely deviations from known ranges of species\u2019 thermal/moisture optima. This proposed work furthers scientific understanding of local responses to global climate change and lays the foundation for a decision analytic approach to climate adaptation in the Caribbean LCC.

Making land acquisition choices for a large, terrestrial protected area is difficult because it occurs over a long timeframe and may involve consideration of future conditions such as climate and urbanization changes. Decision makers need to consider factors including: order of parcel purchasing given budget constraints, future uncertainty, potential future landscape-scale changes from urbanization, and climate. In central Florida, two new refuges and the expansion of a third refuge are in various stages of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) planning. The Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge (EHNWR) has recently been established. The new refuges were strategically located for both species adaptation from climate change impacts as well as currently hosting a number of important threatened and endangered species and habitats. For this study we combined a structured decision making framework, optimal solution theory, and output from urbanization models that provide forecasts of population growth that might be expected due to climate change, and provide guidance for EHNWR reserve design. Utilizing a SDM approach and optimal solution theory, we used stakeholder-determined objectives to design optimal configurations for the refuge and help FWS in land acquisition prioritization.

Researchers solicited input from project stakeholders, scientists, and engineers and incorporated this information, along with modeling and quantitative analysis, into a framework to inform decision-making, should the island incur storm damage while the restoration is underway.   Ultimately, the structured decision-making process yielded management recommendations that can be quickly and effectively implemented during the Ship Island construction, while helping participants maximize the island\u2019s future resilience. It also led to a general decision framework and process that could be expanded and adapted for use by future barrier island restoration projects.

This project examined the decision making context, decision making process, and management planning associated with the restoration of open pine ecosystems in the Southeast. To better understand the planning practice associated with this system, we assessed the quality of 35 management plans from federal, state, and non-governmental agencies. We found that newer plans scored higher than older plans, suggesting agencies may be learning to develop better plans over time and indicating older plans should be prioritized for revision. Plans from federal and state agencies scored higher than plans from non-governmental agencies, reflecting differences in agency missions and resources. The fact base scored high across most plans, whereas actions and implementation scored lower. Although agencies tended to perform best on fact base, our results suggest having a strong fact base has little influence on other components. To improve actions and implementation, planners should consider incorporating more stakeholder participation to help them develop better actions and implementation indirectly through improved problem and objective statements.  We also investigated how decisions were being made and what barriers - if any - faced decision makers. To gain this insight, we conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with key decision makers and stakeholders and our findings emphasized the challenge of collaboration between individuals, governmental, and non-governmental organizations. We found discrepancies between groups on everything from objectives and goals, to how decisions are made, the barriers groups are facing, information that is used to make those decisions and where information comes from as well as differences in decision making timing and frequency. Agency managers had firm objectives while landowners/private land managers had flexible objectives that changed based on new goals, knowledge and information. In the same vein, agency managers said it was hard to change their management plans but landowners/private land managers said that their management plans were constantly changing to meet their shifting objectives. Agency managers reported that they had access to all of the information they needed to make \u201cgood\u201d decisions while landowners/private managers said that they wanted and needed more information, specifically better economic and growth data. And although agency managers said climate change was a factor when making decisions, landowners/private land managers said that climate change was not a decision making factor. To bridge the gap between the two groups and increase information sharing, a library of regulatory requirements, scientific data, personal experiences and fiscal information may be a way to align management objectives and goals.  Lastly, we developed a questionnaire that can be used in future research projects to evaluate how socio-structural drivers and the personas of decision makers influence their decision making.

However, land use change associated with urbanization is having a significant effect on wildlife populations and habitat availability. We sought to understand the effect of global warming on both beneficial and pest insects of trees. We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100. We were able to develop good predictive models of how warming influences beneficial and pest insects for cities in the Southeast and across the east coast more generally. We were also able to predict how tree health will respond to these changes in insect communities. In addition, by comparing our results to those we garnered from herbarium specimens (many insects can be found on herbarium specimens) we could show that the effects of urban warming match those of climate change through time. In short, a subset of pests is likely to get far worse with warming and this effect is likely to be most pronounced in the Southeast. A second body of work built on these discoveries to consider how to protect trees and forests from the pests that do better with warming. Work continues to be focused on the importance of which trees are present (or planted) and the diversity of those trees.

One reason is that much of its primary habitat, sparse stands of mature pine, has been replaced by development or agriculture. Another is that periodic ground fires, which are important for providing needed forage for the tortoise, have been largely suppressed on the landscape. The gopher tortoise is a \u201ckeystone\u201d species, meaning that its disappearance from the landscape would jeopardize the existence of many other species that make use of its underground burrows.  Besides tortoise habitat, the uplands of the Coastal Plain contain isolated seasonal wetlands that are important for the life cycles of many amphibian species. The state of Georgia would like to conserve more of the landscape for the statewide protection of the gopher tortoise and associated natural communities. The different steps it could take include conservation partnerships formed with private landowners and land purchases as opportunities arise. But these decisions are hard because of uncertainties about tortoise population ecology and future patterns of urbanization.  The goal of this project was to develop a decision support tool to help build efficiency in the selection of conservation actions that lead to more viable landscapes to support the statewide tortoise population and associated species and communities.

Conservation and protection of these birds is important for the functioning of healthy ecosystems and for maintaining biodiversity in North America. Consequently, resource managers along the gulf need decision-aiding tools that can efficiently help to answer important conservation questions for different species (e.g. which areas and how much area should be targeted by management actions to meet a particular species\u2019 needs).  To address this need, project researchers are developing statistical models that will help identify habitat conservation objectives and actions for bird species taking into account different gulf coast conservation scenarios that might occur in response to sea-level rise. The project will focus specifically on the Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger) and Gull-billed Tern (Gelochelidon nilotica), two species identified as representative of sustainable gulf habitats and designated as U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Species of Conservation Concern and Gulf Coast Joint Venture Priority Species. These two birds are also representative of a variety of other beach and barrier-island nesting birds whose nesting habitats are threatened by sea-level rise (e.g., Least Tern, Snowy and Wilson\u2019s Plover). The statistical models will link each bird\u2019s population abundance to habitat characteristics that could be influenced by different management actions and will use this information to identify conservation objectives under different conservation scenarios.

These include the gopher tortoise, striped newt, gopher frog, southern hognose snake, and Florida pine snake. This ecosystem also supports a large number of priority plants. State wildlife agencies in the Southeast are partnering with USFWS to assess the status of these species and to implement actions that will protect and restore them on public and private lands.

This process is recognized as one of the most pressing conservation issues in the Southeastern U.S. Habitat loss and fragmentation reduces the amount of suitable habitat available to wildlife species, divides wildlife populations and reduces genetic diversity, and interrupts important migration patterns; and climate change is likely to disrupt habitat areas even more. Maintaining connectivity between habitats and wildlife populations will be a key management strategy for conserving biodiversity in the region into the future.  Previous work by the research team modeled and mapped connectivity in the Southeast for three animals that inhabit bottomland forests, and showed where key connections in the landscape lie both currently and in the future. However, the researchers observed large variation in connectivity across geographical areas, time periods, and species. These results raised new questions about which connections are most important for management actions.  This project built on this previous research with four approaches: 1) analyze consistency between this work and other connectivity efforts; 2) asses trade-offs between current and future connectivity; 3) extend work on the prioritization of core habitat areas and central points of connectivity; and 4) optimize the selection of sites for conservation action at the local scale. This project had a regional focus of bottomland hardwoods, but also extended to include longleaf pine forests. This work was intended to provide a greater understanding of high priority areas for connectivity to inform conservation planners in the Southeast.

However, while some of these resources are easily accessible by coastal managers, many others require more expert knowledge to understand or utilize.  The goal of this project was to collate science and models pertaining to the effects of sea-level on coastal wetlands into a format that would be accessible and useful to resource managers. Researchers conducted training sessions with coastal managers at federal agencies including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Park Service to evaluate managers\u2019 needs and understanding of concepts, data, and modeling tools for projecting sea-level rise and its impact on coastal habitats and wildlife.

Climate change is projected to exacerbate fragmentation by further disrupting landscapes. To make matters worse, it is also expected to shift the range of many species, forcing animals capable of adapting by moving to expand into new areas to find more suitable temperatures and adequate food supplies \u2013 a challenge made difficult, if not impossible, by disconnected landscapes. Maintaining connectivity between habitats is a key strategy for conserving wildlife populations into the future, and sound science is needed to inform conservation decisions.  Scientists with the SE CSC, in partnership with the South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative, assessed current and projected connectivity for three species that inhabit bottomland hardwood forests, a habitat of high conservation concern: American black bear, Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bat, and timber rattlesnake. Not surprisingly, the study results suggest that under anticipated climate conditions, there will be fewer connections for species to move between suitable habitats.  Moreover, the findings reveal that the connectedness of a future landscape will be species specific. For example, what may be sufficiently connected for a black bear to easily traverse long distances might well prove to be disconnected for a rattlesnake. This suggests a limited ability for managers to use the \u201cumbrella species\u201d concept to make generalized management decisions. The team additionally found that connectivity projections differ based on the model and method being used. Researchers suggest that managers and others use multiple techniques and focus on multiple species to get a more holistic, accurate representation of how species will use a particular landscape in the future and how connections between and among habitats can be strengthened most effectively.

They are also vulnerable to climate change. In particular, changes in winter climate (warmer temperatures and fewer freeze events) may transform coastal wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico, as mangrove forests are expected to expand their range and replace salt marshes.   The objective of this research was to evaluate the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. As part of this project, researchers identified important thresholds for ecosystem changes and highlighted coastal areas in the southeastern U.S. (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, and parts of Florida) where relatively small changes in winter conditions could cause relatively dramatic changes in coastal wetlands. Results indicate that mangrove forest expansion will bring about both above- and below-ground ecosystem changes. The most striking and apparent changes will occur above ground as forests develop and replace grasslands. These above-ground transformations will increase carbon storage and affect certain societal benefits provided by coastal wetlands in the region. The below-ground changes due to mangrove expansion will be more subtle and dependent upon the marsh that is being replaced. The below-ground impacts will be greatest along dry coasts (Texas), where mangrove expansion is expected to result in greater peat development and soil carbon storage. That said, there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d model for what will happen \u2013 the type and extent of changes will depend heavily on the specific characteristics of the site.   The data and publications from this work can help environmental managers and decision makers plan and prepare for future change in coastal wetlands and related impacts to fish and wildlife populations and ecosystem services.

Understanding how climate change will affect these ecosystems is vital for knowing how best to protect them and the services they supply.  The goal of this project was to assess the climate change vulnerability of 12 key ecosystems in the southeastern U.S. and Caribbean, ranging from Caribbean coastal mangrove to Nashville Basin limestone glade and woodland. Scientists used the existing scientific literature and geospatial analysis to determine each ecosystem\u2019s sensitivity to changes in climate, its exposure level to those changes, and its capacity to adapt. Together, this information was compiled into a qualitative vulnerability ranking for each ecosystem. For two of the 12 ecosystems, scientists additionally assessed vulnerability using NatureServe\u2019s Habitat Climate Change Vulnerability Index framework.  Of the 12 ecosystems examined, five were rated as having high vulnerability to climate change, six had moderate vulnerability, and one had low vulnerability. For the two ecosystems assessed with multiple approaches, these rankings generally agreed. Researchers additionally identified critical management actions for reducing threats to and promoting adaptation of these ecosystems. Collectively, the results of this project can help regional decision-makers plan and prioritize their conservation and monitoring efforts.

Even decisions that are supported by science contain some level of remaining uncertainty. In the context of conservation and wildlife management, the potential for uncertainty to influence decisions is perhaps most obvious when we think about predicting how actions (or non-actions) will have lasting impacts into the future. Our abilities to precisely predict future climatic and ecological conditions and determine the exact consequences of our actions are, and will remain, limited.   Conservation practitioners and land and wildlife managers must navigate these challenges to make science-informed decisions to advance conservation and adaptation of important natural resources.  The degree to which management objectives are successfully met can depend on 1) how critical uncertainties are identified and accounted for, and 2) effective communication among stakeholders, scientists, and natural resource managers. The objective of this project is to help facilitate strategic decision support and synthesize the state of the science related to communicating and using uncertain information in conservation decision making.  In February 2013, this project brought together scientists, decision makers, planners, and resource managers across universities and federal and state agencies for a workshop intended, in part, to identify research and strategic-planning needs for effective delivery of regional conservation policy, with an emphasis on providing science-based decision support in the presence of uncertainty and climate change.  The outcomes from this workshop, along with the products developed for the project, advance a decision-analytic perspective within the conservation community and will have practical use as decision support for conservation practitioners and decision makers.

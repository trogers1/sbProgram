These objectives were designed to address decision support needs for climate adaptation and resource management actions. Specifically, understanding of uncertainty in climate projections - in particular for extreme events - is currently a key scientific and management barrier to adaptation planning and vulnerability assessment. The new dataset fills in the Northwest domain to cover a key gap in the previous dataset, adds additional projections (both from other global climate models and a comparison with dynamical downscaling) and includes an assessment of changes to flow and soil moisture extremes. This new information can be used to assess variations in impacts across the landscape, uncertainty in projections, and how these differ as a function of region, variable, and time period.  In this project, existing University of Washington Climate Impacts Group (UW CIG) products were extended to develop a comprehensive data archive that accounts (in a rigorous and physically based way) for climate model uncertainty in future climate and hydrologic scenarios. These products can be used to determine likely impacts on vegetation and aquatic habitat in the Pacific Northwest region, including WA, OR, ID, northwest MT to the continental divide, northern CA, NV, UT, and the Columbia Basin portion of western WY. New data series and summaries produced for this project include: (1) extreme statistics for surface hydrology (e.g., frequency of soil moisture and summer water deficit) and streamflow (e.g. the 100-\u00adyear flood, extreme 7-\u00adday low flows with a 10-\u00adyear recurrence interval); (2) snowpack vulnerability as indicated by the ratio of April 1 snow water to cool-\u00adseason precipitation; and (3) uncertainty analyses for multiple climate scenarios.

As water levels drop, some small streams become fragmented, transforming from a ribbon of continuous habitat into a series of isolated pools. Fragmented streams may pose a serious threat to salmon. For example, juveniles that become stranded in small pools are at increased risk to overheat, starve, or be consumed by predators.  Healthy salmon populations can cope with fragmentation and recover from a bad drought-year. However, many salmon populations are endangered and face long-term drought. Land and resource managers are increasingly finding endangered salmon stranded in fragmented habitats, facing what is presumed to be certain death. Desperate to help, a small group of managers and conservation stewards are experimenting with fish rescue, capturing juvenile salmon from fragmented habitats and moving them to hatchery-like facilities until they grow large enough to go to sea.  There are growing demands to expand fish rescue programs, however no one has actually evaluated whether it is safe, effective, or feasible at scales that would have meaningful impact. This project aims to measure the effects of fish rescue at multiple life-stages and analyze the costs and benefits of applying this technique across the Northwest. The final product will be a tool that allows natural resource managers to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of fish rescue in the context of their specific watershed and salmon population.

In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands, where the ocean meets the land, are highly productive areas that support a wealth of wildlife species from salmon to ducks. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. However, wetlands in this region and elsewhere are threatened by sea-level rise and other climate-related changes. According to a USFWS and NOAA report, between 2004 and 2009, 80,000 acres of wetland were lost on average each year, which is a significant increase from the previous six years.  While we know that these coastal ecosystems are already changing, we know comparatively less about how these areas might continue to change over the next 50 to 100 years. The goal of this project was to provide scientific information that will support long-term coastal planning and conservation efforts in the face of changing climate conditions. Researchers looked at the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon. They compiled data on coastal terrain, tidal flooding, vegetation, and how quickly sediments accumulate, to assess how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Researchers found that factors such as elevation, sediments, and rate of sea-level rise can all affect marsh resilience. Importantly, researchers found that while most of the tidal marsh study sites will be able to persist in the face of sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, sea-level rise could eventually outpace the growth of marshes and drown most high and mid-elevation marsh habitats by 2110.", "items": {"55ae7d09e4b066a24924239f": {"title": "USGS Pacific Tidal Marsh Soil Core Surveys, Pacific Northwest US, 2013-14", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55ae7d09e4b066a24924239f"}, "5af4afdae4b0da30c1b44f0b": {"title": "Digital Elevation Models for eight study areas in coastal Oregon and Washington, 2012", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5af4afdae4b0da30c1b44f0b"}, "5af4cc2ce4b0da30c1b44f6b": {"title": "WARMER model projections of sea-level rise for eight tidal marsh study areas on coastal Oregon and Washington, 2010-2110", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5af4cc2ce4b0da30c1b44f6b"}, "5aecab27e4b0860c0f745795": {"title": "Elevation Points for Eight Study Areas in Coastal Oregon and Washington, 2012", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5aecab27e4b0860c0f745795"}, "5af22e9ee4b0da30c1b0c942": {"title": "Bathymetry Digital Elevation Models for Eight Study Areas in Coastal Oregon and Washington, 2012", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5af22e9ee4b0da30c1b0c942"}, "55b2db24e4b09a3b01b5d9da": {"title": "Vegetation Surveys, All Field Sites, 2012-2014", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55b2db24e4b09a3b01b5d9da"}, "55b2eb2be4b09a3b01b5da02": {"title": "Water Monitoring Data, All Study Sites, 2011-2015", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55b2eb2be4b09a3b01b5da02"}}}, {"num_items": 0, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55e0edd5e4b05561fa2064fb", "node": 3, "name": "Support for the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians Tribal Leaders Summit on Climate Change", "casc": "Northwest CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "Tribal communities\u2019 traditions, identities, and economies rely heavily on local natural resources, making tribes especially vulnerable to climate change impacts, including changes in seasonal patterns and the potential loss of culturally and economically important species.

Many federal, state and local agencies use stream insects to monitor the health of freshwater ecosystems. While the temperature ranges for some insects are often inferred from the temperature of the waters where they were collected, this inference is coarse at best and problematic at worst. Stream temperatures fluctuate a lot during the year and temperature may or may not control where an insect lives. Field insects were collected and sent to a laboratory for testing several temperature endpoints, particularly at higher temperatures. Respiration, breathing rate, and some physical activities were expected to increase, as the insects attempt to deal with elevated temperatures and expected oxygen limitations. Previous research found that oxygen limitation results in the build-up of lactic and uric acids in tissues of insects, but this was not observed over the range of temperatures and types of insects tested for this study. While respiration, breathing rate and, physical behavior such as pumping motions were observed, it did not appear that elevated temperature alone was resulting in oxygen limitation. This was further confirmed with more experiments that looked specifically at low oxygen waters at various temperatures and included an evaluation of the insect\u2019s metabolic waste products; these warm temperature challenges did not suggest an oxygen deficit in these insects. Rather, the experiments suggested a more general elevated metabolic demand where the insects had to work harder to breath, eat, and molt. Further work to try and identify specific macroinvertebrate temperature tolerance values could be used by scientists and resource managers to predict aquatic resources at greatest risk to temperature change.

Cheatgrass dominated areas experience more fires that burn more land than in native ecosystems, resulting in economic and resource losses. Therefore, the reduced production, or absence, of cheatgrass in previously invaded areas during years of adequate precipitation could be seen as a windfall. However, this cheatgrass dieoff phenomenon creates other problems for land managers like accelerated soil erosion, loss of early spring food supply for livestock and wildlife, and unknown recovery pathways. We used satellite data and scientific techniques to map annual estimated cheatgrass percent cover and areas of cheatgrass dieoff in the western and central parts of the northern Great Basin from 2000 - 2010. For this same area, we developed a map of cheatgrass percent cover variability and another map that displays cheatgrass dieoff probability.  These maps can assist land managers in understanding when and where cheatgrass did and did not exist over an extremely large landscape, and the maps can possibly explain characteristics of dieoff areas that can help researchers pinpoint the cause or causes of cheatgrass dieoff. The cheatgrass dieoff maps show that dieoff areas are spatially and temporally variable, or, in other words, a dieoff may afflict an area for a few years and then cheatgrass may return, only to dieoff again later. This pattern of variability can also persist in different areas. During the study period we estimated that, on average, about 2.6 million acres experienced cheatgrass dieoff annually.Restoring dieoff areas to a native ecosystem could be a goal of land managers, but until cheatgrass dieoff causes and natural recovery pathways are better understood, engaging in costly restoration activities may be unwise.

It is also because connectivity facilitates many other important ecological and evolutionary processes within species' ranges, further promoting resilience and healthy populations.

Because individual species respond to climate change differently, some will be adversely affected by climate change whereas others may benefit. Successfully managing species in a changing climate will require an understanding of which species will be most and least impacted by climate change. Although several approaches have been proposed for assessing the vulnerability of species to climate change, it is unclear whether these approaches are likely to produce similar results. In this study, we compared the relative vulnerabilities to climate change of 76 species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and trees based on three different approaches to assessing vulnerability. We compared (1) projected shifts in species distributions to (2) an assessment based on expert opinion and projected changes in climate to (3) an approach based on the current and future climatic conditions within species\u2019 current ranges. We found that the three approaches provided substantially different rankings of the species. Some species were determined to be highly vulnerable by one approach but only moderately vulnerable by the other two approaches. Only one species, the caribou, was consistently ranked in the top ten most vulnerable species by all three approaches. This is not entirely surprising given that the three measures assess different aspects of vulnerability and are based on different types of information. Nonetheless, these results are important because they indicate that more than one approach may be needed to adequately assess vulnerability and that basing management decisions on one approach alone may lead scientists and managers to underestimate vulnerability.

Over the past century, however, populations have dramatically declined due to habitat loss, overharvest, and invasive species. Consequently, many populations are listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Complicating these stressors is global warming and associated climate change. Overall, aquatic ecosystems across the PNW are predicted to experience increasingly earlier snowmelt in the spring, reduced late spring and summer flows, increased winter flooding, warmer and drier summers, increased water temperatures, and expansion of invasive species. Understanding how effects of climate change might influence habitat for native salmonid populations is critical for effective management and recovery of these species. Scientists at the USGS and University of Montana used novel techniques and empirical data to study how climate change may drive landscape scale impacts that affect freshwater habitats and populations of key salmonid species (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and steelhead) throughout the PNW. Results showed strong linkages between climatic drivers (temperature and flow regimes) and the distribution, abundance, and genetic diversity of native salmonids across the PNW. Specifically, warming temperatures and shifting flow regimes are expected to fragment stream systems and cause salmonids to retreat upstream to headwater areas, thereby decreasing fish population abundance and genetic diversity, both of which are critical for persistence in a changing landscape. Climate-change\u2010induced periods of decreasing spring snowmelt and increases in stream temperatures are likely to decrease native biodiversity by fostering cross-breeding between invasive and native trout species.

Despite the smaller changes in avian communities, our models do project significant changes in abundance for some species in specific locations ranging from large increases to local extirpations. Our results also show that for some bird species, vegetation model projections are particularly important for forecasting changes in abundances and distributions. For example, Columbia Plateau Low Sagebrush Steppe and Shrubland, Northern Rocky Mountain-Vancouverian Montane-Foothill Grassland, and Great Basin and Intermountain (Sagebrush) Shrubland and Steppe were particularly important predictors for Oregon Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus affinis). Dynamic general vegetation model (DGVM) outputs, such as fire, fuels, and carbon were important predictors of these habitat types.

The ecological impacts of invasive species are often irreversible, and include the loss of native species and the spread of disease. Implications for human communities include damaged water transportation systems, reduced crop yields, reduced forage quality for livestock, and widespread tree death - which can lead to increases in wildfire and loss of biodiversity. Changing climate conditions may facilitate the spread of invasive species, making this a key management and conservation concern across the United States.   This project will synthesize what we know about how climate change impacts the spread of invasive species across the Northwest. This information is critical for developing effective management strategies that prevent the establishment of invasive species, slow their spread, and minimize their negative ecological and economic impacts. This synthesis will identify the environmental conditions that facilitate the spread of invasive species, and what habitats and native species might be most vulnerable to their future spread. By identifying these commonalities, this project will help managers understand the risks posed by invasive species and to proactively take steps to stop the establishment or expansion of invasives in the Northwest.", "items": {}}, {"num_items": 3, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5006eb3ee4b0abf7ce733f5a", "node": 31, "name": "Sagebrush Ecosystems in a Changing Climate", "casc": "Northwest CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "Climate responses of sagebrush are needed to inform land managers of the stability and restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, which are an important but threatened habitat type. We evaluated climate responses of sagebrush using two approaches: (1) experimental manipulations of temperature and precipitation for natural plants in the field, and (2) assessment of how climate adaptation and weather have affected sagebrush seeding efforts on nearly 25 large-scale sagebrush seeding projects done over the past several decades. Experimental warming increased growth of sagebrush in high-elevation meadows in the Teton Mountains, but had marginal or no effect at lower elevations sites (near Twin Falls and Boise, Idaho, respectively). Increased precipitation enhanced sagebrush abundance, along with flowering and stem growth, particularly when added in winter on deep soils. In the post-fire seeding study, we found sagebrush abundances to be highly variable across different seeding projects, and the variation was partly related to the climate of seeding and seed-source sites and weather. Sagebrush seeds typically traveled hundreds of kilometers and nearly 1000 m downhill from seed source/origins to seeding sites, from sites with colder minimum temperatures than the seeding sites. Big sagebrush is comprised of subspecies that differ in their climate adaptation, and many seeding projects received a subspecies that differed from the native type requested by the land managers. These climate transfers appeared important to the success of seedings: successful seedings imported seeds from sites having the same minimum temperatures. In failed  seedings, seeds originated from relatively colder sites and, moreover, years with relatively warm minimum temperatures prevailed following planting. These results suggest minimum  temperature and winter precipitation responses are important factors in the climate adaptation and ecology of this desert shrub, and their consideration in climate vulnerability analyses and selection of seed sources is likely to improve land planning and restoration.

Climate change adds a layer of complexity to the planning process because of its uncertain effects on the environment. In order to make sound decisions, managers need information about how climate change will affect wildlife habitat, both on its own and in conjunction with management actions.  The goal of this project was to explore how future climate may interact with management alternatives to shape wildlife habitat across large landscapes. Scientists used computer simulations to investigate a range of future climate and management scenarios, focusing on habitat for two iconic species: the northern spotted owl and the greater sage-grouse.  Findings reveal that increasing wildfire is likely to be the primary threat to owl habitat as a result of climate change. Management actions that reduce the amount of vegetation available as fuel may be helpful at counteracting this threat, at least in southwestern Oregon. In the case of the greater sage-grouse, expected increases in wildfire may actually be helpful for managers, as they help to control the spread of juniper. However, invasive grasses are poised to overtake much of the landscape, creating a new management challenge.  While the task of managing habitat in the face of climate change is daunting, this research yielded information that may be useful for setting management priorities and developing strategies that sustain these landscapes for both humans and wildlife.

However, as temperatures rise, non-native invasive fish species could be poised to prosper in the region as conditions start to favor warm-water species over those that require cooler waters to thrive. The spread of invasive fish species has the potential to devastate native fish populations, stream habitats, and the local cultures and economies that depend on healthy aquatic ecosystems \u2013 including the region\u2019s multi-billion dollar outdoor recreation industry.   Despite these concerns, our current understanding of how shifting climate conditions will impact future expansions of invasive fish is limited. Major questions concerning which species will prosper, where they will prosper, and what this will mean for resource management remain unanswered. This uncertainty presents a significant challenge to managers working to conserve and restore at-risk species, and hampers strategic economic development in the Columbia River Basin. To address these limitations, researchers will use existing data collected by federal and tribal natural resource agencies to predict where five problematic invasive fish species \u2013 brook trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, and northern pike \u2013 will likely proliferate under future climate conditions and where they may impact native salmon and trout populations.

Recent changes in climate have caused winter flooding and warmer summer water temperatures in the region, reducing the cold-water habitats that bull trout depend on. The southernmost bull trout populations, found in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada, are currently restricted to small reserves where the coldest waters still exist. These shrinking habitats have created a severed environment being further split by dams, poor water quality, and invasive species.  The goal of this project was to determine how these factors threaten the species regionally by using predictions of stream temperature to map habitat areas that support juvenile bull trout. Results show that maintaining larger areas of cold water habitat had the greatest, positive impact on bull trout habitat conservation. Other conditions that support bull trout include very cold summer water temperatures, fewer winter floods, and fewer human disturbances (such as the building of dams). Based on these results, specific climate adaptation actions that local managers might consider include prioritizing land and water use to foster colder summer water temperatures, controlling invasive species, increasing connectivity between Bull Trout habitats, and continuing monitoring efforts.  To ensure that these results and habitat maps could be incorporated into management actions, researchers met with stakeholders including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the U.S. Forest Service, and the Burns Paiute Tribe.  As a result, the maps were used in forest planning for the Lolo National Forest in Montana, the Wenatchee River basin, and in the lower Pend Oreille River during the relicensing process for local dam operations. In addition, the recovery plan proposed by the USFWS incorporated these models into detailed analyses of bull trout habitat loss, which managers can use to prioritize actions in their Recovery Unit Implementation Plans.

The urban heat island effect (when cities and urban areas are warmer than surrounding rural areas) may heat the temperature of the runoff and if the runoff is very warm, it could tip salmon habitat into fatal conditions.

The ability of this coldwater species to survive in one of the region\u2019s warmest watersheds could hold valuable clues for conservation in the face of warming global temperatures, which represents one of the biggest threats to North America\u2019s coldwater fish.  Previous research has found that redband trout rely heavily on spring-fed habitats. These springs provide pockets of cooler water for relief from extreme temperatures in the summer, and comparably warmer waters for spawning in the winter. Fish will migrate long distances to spawn in these habitats, sometimes 100 miles or more. However, there is currently a lack of information on how these \u201crefugia\u201d are used by fish throughout their life cycle. This prevents managers from understanding how refugia scale-up across the landscape and support fish at the population level.

These trees currently face multiple threats, including attack by the mountain pine beetle, which has recently killed whitebark pines over much of the western U.S. Climate is an important factor in these outbreaks, and future warming is expected to affect epidemics. Our project developed statistical models of outbreaks in whitebark pine for three regions: the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Northern U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the Cascade Range. We used these models to understand climate/beetle outbreak relationships, evaluate climatic causes of recent outbreaks, and estimate the potential for future outbreaks given projections of climate change. The models fit the observations well, indicating confidence in their reliability. Climate influenced mountain pine beetle outbreaks through fall and winter temperatures, which are direct effects on beetles, as well as via reduced summer precipitation which increases drought stress on trees. Recent outbreaks were caused by warming and drought in the early 2000s. We found that, compared with a baseline of 1985-1994 when little beetle activity occurred, future climate will be more favorable for mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, our preliminary results indicate that some projections were similar to or exceed the climate favorability of conditions during the recent severe and extensive outbreak (2000-2009). Variability existed among outbreak projections as a result of the amount of future warming and changes in precipitation, which are functions of climate model, emissions scenario, and decade.

However, it\u2019s important that we also understand how the timing of phenological events is changing over longer time frames, as climate conditions change.   While some species appear to be adjusting to the increase in unseasonal temperatures, drought, and extreme storms that have come with climate change, not all species are responding at the same speed or in the same ways. This can disrupt the manner in which species interact and the way that ecosystems function overall. For example, plants may bloom before butterflies emerge to pollinate them, or caterpillars may emerge before migratory birds arrive to feed them to their young.

Unfortunately, not only are these valuable ecosystems understudied compared to others, but they are also among the most sensitive to climate change. Climate change threatens wetlands by altering temperature and precipitation, which cause changes in water level and water temperature. Due to this threat, the international community and domestic agencies alike have highlighted the need to better understand wetlands in the face of climate change, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to the Ramsar Convention, to the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service.   Focusing on the Pacific Northwest region, this project substantially improves our understanding of wetlands and how they will respond to climate change. Researchers developed new methods to map and monitor wetlands, modeled historical and future wetland hydrologic conditions, and evaluated the impacts of climate change on wetlands and the species that rely on them.  Results show that montane wetlands \u2013 those found in high altitudes \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to climate change, which is causing reduced snowpack and longer summer drought, threatening the species that depend on them. Amphibians in particular, such as the Cascades frog, rely on wetlands for breeding and are at risk of local extinction due to the loss of suitable habitat.   This research produced information that is essential for managers seeking to understand the vulnerability of wetland ecosystems to climate change and to effectively plan for and mitigate its impacts. By studying wetlands in multiple locations throughout the Pacific Northwest, researchers discovered that the effects of climate change varied considerably between sites, suggesting that a one-size-fits all approach might not work \u2013 rather, management efforts may need to be tailored accordingly from site to site.

This project is addressing one critical part of those impacts: the islands of unburned vegetation within wildfires. Unburned islands occur naturally as wildfires burn across landscapes, and are important habitat refuges for species -- places where plants and animals survive the fire and subsequently regenerate across the recently burned landscape. Since they are naturally resistant to burning, understanding how climate change impacts these islands will help us understand what species may be in even more danger from wildfires if these refuges disappear. Studying them and copying their characteristics can also help humans build our homes and communities to be more resistant to wildfire.

As the western population is projected to grow by 310 million people by 2100, this will potentially increase demand for diminishing supplies if housing growth occurs in rangelands or forested lands. Understanding watershed vulnerabilities due to changing climate, fire regime, and population pressures is important to managers, and more importantly, to human well-being.

Recent technological advances in stream temperature monitoring (e.g., digital data loggers and remote sensors) and modeling have increased the amount of data that are available (both observed and projected) throughout the region. These newly available data, although exciting, have strengths and limitations depending on the purposes for which they were developed and the scale(s) at which they can be used to address management questions. For instance, a spatially expansive stream temperature dataset may be perfect for answering questions about how species distributions may change, but it may not be very good for identifying localized cold water refuges. Future projections made using statistical models may not be accurate if extrapolated to conditions not seen historically, or if applied in new areas. To address these challenges, we propose to develop a handbook for natural resource managers that will guide the selection and use of stream temperature dataset(s) that are appropriate for answering management or conservation questions. We will engage with natural resource stakeholders in the Pacific Northwest to learn about pertinent management issues, stream temperature data already in use, and information gaps.

Will they be stable or unstable? Will the waters be cold and clear or warm and muddy? Will they have salmon or other species? These questions motivated our two-year study of climate warming effects on headwater streams draining the Cascade Mountains. Using a novel combination of snow, geohydrology, and sediment transport models we assessed the vulnerability of stream channels to changing peak streamflow. Our snow modeling shows that with just a 2\u00b0C warming, snowfall shifts to rainfall at all elevations, peak snowpacks occur over two months earlier, and snowpacks are reduced by over half of historical values. Our geohydrology modeling shows that greater rainfall and earlier snowmelt enhances peak winter streamflows but impacts depend on snow amount and watershed geohydrology. In spring-fed watersheds, increased winter flows are within historical bounds. In runoff-dominated watersheds, increased winter flows will exceed the historical range by up to 44% and the frequency of high flows will increase by over 100 days per year. Since streambed gravels and sand are transported during high flows, climate warming is likely to result in a dramatic increase in the amount of sediment moving through Cascade streams. Daily sediment transport rates in the surface-runoff system could potentially double. Besides affecting water quality with increased levels of suspended sediment, more frequent sediment transport events may lead to instability in the gravels where bull trout and salmon lay their eggs, making their survival less certain in the future. A key aspect of this project was engaging managers through a knowledge- to-action approach. Stakeholder dialogues were held in organized workshops and informal discussions through which we shared needs, information, and knowledge to interpret the consequences of these projected changes for water supply, threatened and endangered aquatic species, and dam operations.

old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest provide critical habitat for threatened and endangered species, including the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet. Dominated by large Douglas-firs and western hemlocks, these established forests range in age from 200 to 1,000 years old. Yet wildfire activity is increasing across western North America, heightening concerns about severe fires that have the potential to kill the upper canopy layer of forests. Known as \u201cstand-replacing fires\u201d, these extreme events have important implications for forest ecosystems, initiating forest regrowth and altering habitat for wildlife.   Identifying locations that are protected from stand-replacing fire is an urgent management priority, particularly given projections of more extreme fires as climate conditions change. These \u201cfire refugia\u201d -  places that remain unburned or experience minimal tree mortality compared to the surrounding landscape - can be key to biodiversity conservation and adaptation. Despite concerns about increasing fire severity, mapping of fire refugia and stand-replacing fire has not been completed for old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest, hindering conservation planning for threatened and endangered species.  To address this need, researchers will map the probability of fire refugia and stand-replacing fire, based on topographic conditions, fire weather, fuel loads, and climate. They will then use this information to assess the likely future occurrence of old-growth, fire-resistant forests and young, post-fire forests in the Pacific Northwest under increasingly extreme fire weather. These maps will provide estimates of where old-growth forests are likely to persist, and where they are more susceptible to be lost to stand-replacing fires, supporting managers who are revising forest plans, implementing habitat conservation plans, and designing forest reserve networks in the region. Maps of likely refugia and stand-replacing fire also will help federal and state agencies, tribes, and non-governmental organizations identify locations for barred owl management, early-successional vegetation conservation, and sustainable forest management activities.", "items": {}}, {"num_items": 1, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55e07c5fe4b0f42e3d040f3e", "node": 69, "name": "Can We Conserve Wetlands Under a Changing Climate? Mapping Wetland Hydrology in the Columbia Plateau", "casc": "Northwest CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "As the impacts of climate change amplify, understanding the consequences for wetlands will be critical for their sustainable management and conservation, particularly in arid regions such as the Columbia Plateau. The depressional wetlands in this region (wetlands located in topographic depressions where water can accumulate) are an important source of surface water during the summer months. However, their health depends directly on precipitation and evaporation, making them susceptible to changes in temperature and precipitation. Yet few tools for monitoring water movement patterns (hydrology) in and out of these landscapes currently exist, hindering efforts to model how they are changing.   This project provided data on wetland locations, historical hydrologic dynamics, and projected climate change impacts by analyzing flooding and drying patterns for thousands of wetlands in the Columbia Plateau from 1984 to 2011. The data describes the change between historical and future projected wetland patterns across the region. Researchers found that wetlands in the region will respond differently to projected changes in climate. Groundwater-driven wetlands, which tend to be more permanently flooded, may see increases in water levels and dry less frequently. Surface-water-driven wetlands, which flood seasonally, may see a decrease in surface-water levels, dry more frequently, and dry earlier in the season.   Understanding how changes in climate could impact depressional wetland dynamics is critical for sustainable management and conservation in dry areas like the Columbia Plateau. To ensure usability, researchers provided guidance on using the data to federal and state agencies, tribes, universities, and nonprofit organizations, such as Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge, Foster Creek Conservation District, and the Natural Resources Department of Yakama Nation. This information can help managers explore how management strategies may need to adapt, given the expected future changes in wetland hydrology in the region.

This project sought to understand the ways in which Native American culture and cultural practices in the northwestern U.S. have been affected by climate change. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with tribal elders and cultural experts belonging to three Northwest tribes \u2013 the Confederated Tribes of Salish and Kootenai, the Qinault Indian Nation, and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians.  Researchers found that, in addition to altering some specific cultural practices, climate change is profoundly disrupting tribal identities. For tribes, one of the most significant effects of climate change is disturbance to the timing of natural cycles and seasonal changes, which have historically served as cues for culturally important activities. Many of the interviewees described a sense of unease associated with the fact that traditional wisdom may no longer be a sound basis for decision making, because environmental situations no longer match the information that has been passed down through generations. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the cultural effects of climate change on Northwest tribes and may serve as a resource for tribes to assess climate change impacts on their practices and identity.

Winters are expected to become wetter and summers could become drier. Snowpack will likely decrease substantially, and snowmelt runoff may occur earlier in the year. Wildfires are projected to become more frequent and severe, and forest types are expected to change from maritime evergreen to subtropical mixed-woodlands.   Because the impacts of climate change vary from place to place, regionally-specific climate projections are critical to help farmers, foresters, city planners, public utility providers, and fish and wildlife managers plan for how to best manage resources. However, the models that are used to project changes in climate are produced at the global scale and do not provide the degree of resolution necessary for generating meaningful projections about changing conditions for a given region.   To address this need, researchers first evaluated the ability of different global climate models to simulate observed patterns in the Northwest. The best-performing models were then downscaled \u2013 that is, transformed from a global scale to a regional scale. Researchers then used the downscaled models to project future changes in climate, vegetation, and hydrology in the region.

Some projections estimate that future sea-level rise could exceed the average elevation of these islands by 2100. Already, residents are facing extreme high tides and 16 foot swells that flood the islands with saltwater, damaging homes and infrastructure and contaminating the freshwater supply.  Land elevation is the primary factor that determines the vulnerability of coastal areas to inundation. This project builds on previous work in which a 1-meter resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was developed for Majuro Atoll, home to the capital and largest city in the Marshall Islands. Researchers will use this DEM to map areas of Majuro Atoll that are vulnerable to inundation, based on different water level scenarios. For example, these maps can be used to answer the question of which areas would flood should seas rise by 0.4, 0.8, or 1 meter, and will represent the first detailed assessment of sea-level rise vulnerability for Majuro.  The results of this project will support assessments of how future inundation events could impact ecosystems, infrastructure, the freshwater supply, and agroforestry on Majuro Atoll.

The goal of this project is to collect data on both silverswords and climate conditions to pinpoint the exact cause of silversword declines and to predict how the species will fare under potential future climate scenarios. Researchers will then identify management strategies that might help restore silversword populations. So far, results show that silversword populations have declined by about 60% since 1990, and that this decline coincides with lower rainfall.   The prominence of the silversword within the Hawaiian alpine ecosystem renders it one of the more visible examples of climate change-induced biodiversity loss.

The number of Marshallese residing in the U.S. has rapidly risen over the past two decades, from 7,000 in 2000 to 22,000 in 2010.

Results indicate that in areas where rainfall is projected to decrease in the future, stream low flow may decrease by more than 50 percent in some areas, and habitat for native species may decrease by more than 25 percent in some streams.

Natural resource managers in sectors such as freshwater, coastal inundation and hazard response, and marine and terrestrial ecosystems need frequently updated summaries of regional and local climate trends, projections, and impacts to better include future climate in their planning strategies. Managers also desire translation of technical climate variables into sectorally relevant impacts and subsequent action and policy responses (Spooner et al., 2013). The proposed collaborative Sustained Assessment Specialist position for the next round of the PIRCA process will provide both timely regional and island level climate summaries and conduct research to identify and define climate variable thresholds that lead to management and adaptation actions on an island scale.

In Hawai\u02bfi, efforts to conserve native forests have come into conflict with objectives to sustain non-native game mammals, such as feral pigs, goats, and deer, for subsistence and sport hunting. Maintaining stable or increasing game populations represents one of the greatest obstacles to the recovery of Hawaii\u2019s 425 threatened and endangered plant species. Many endemic Hawaiian species have declined and become endangered as a result of herbivorous non-native game mammals. Meanwhile, other environmental changes, including the spread of invasive grasses and changing precipitation patterns and wildfire regimes could further interact to alter the distribution and range of native plants.   This project will address the need to optimally balance long-term endangered plant recovery with non-native game management. Focusing on the islands of Maui and L\u0101na\u02bfi, researchers will map the distribution of game species and native plant species, then use these maps to identify zones that would be optimal for plant conservation, and others for game management. This analysis will take into account both the current distribution and potential future distribution of game and plant species, as climate conditions change. The results of this project will support both federal and state land managers in Hawai\u02bfi. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can use these results to inform locations for the conservation and recovery plans for federally-listed species, while the State of Hawai\u02bfi Division of Forestry and Wildlife can use the results to prioritize places for game management.", "items": {}}, {"num_items": 0, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/50118ddce4b0d78fd4e59ba3", "node": 111, "name": "21st Century High-Resolution Climate Projections for Guam and American Samoa", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": " While home to many people and a rich diversity of unique plant and animal life, the U.S. territories of Guam and American Samoa are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change because of their small size, geographical remoteness, and exposure to threats such as sea-level rise and increased storm surge. Developing predictions of future conditions is often the first step in helping decision makers and communities plan for change. However, to date, available global climate models have been too coarse in resolution to be useful for planning in the context of small, isolated islands.  This project produced the first-ever set of high-resolution climate projections for Guam and American Samoa, providing information on key variables of interest to decision makers such as rainfall, air temperature, and tropical cyclone patterns. Modeling results suggest that both territories are expected to become warmer and experience a higher number of extreme rainfall events through the current century. In addition, American Samoa is projected to become wetter overall, with a mean rainfall increase of up to 25 percent by the late 21st century, and Guam may be subject to a higher frequency of strong tropical cyclones. These data will be used by other researchers to inform hydrological and ecosystem models and, ultimately, aid local decision makers as they plan for climate change impacts and seek to reduce risk through effective adaptation.

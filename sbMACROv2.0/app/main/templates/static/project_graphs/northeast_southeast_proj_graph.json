Historically, this effort has focused on the needs of forest managers and forestry professionals. In recent years, however, there has been increasing demand for science and tools to address climate change adaptation in wildlife management and conservation. Not only do wildlife and resource managers need the best available science, it must also be presented in a usable format with feasible options within the purview of an individual manager.  The research team is first completing a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed studies to summarize what wildlife-related management actions currently exist in climate change adaptation. They will then develop and test a \u201cmenu\u201d of climate change adaptation actions that are suitable for wildlife management in terrestrial ecosystems. This Wildlife Adaptation Menu will be modeled off existing adaptation menus for Forestry and Urban Forestry, and it will be designed to be used in conjunction with the Adaptation Workbook. In addition to a menu of adaption strategies and approaches, the scientists will also identify site-level tactics and develop case studies demonstrating the use and implementation of the menu. To ensure that information and tools meet the needs of managers, the team is involving and integrating input from wildlife managers at every step of the process. Managers will be involved in scoping the project, testing the menu, and implementing the menu.

We sought insights by examining Lake Erie as a representative system with a high level of anthropogenic impacts, strong nutrient gradients, seasonal hypoxia, and spatial overlap of cold- and cool-water fish guilds. In Lake Erie and in large embayments throughout the Great Lakes basin, this situation is a concern for fishery managers, as climate change may exacerbate hypoxia and reduce habitat volume for some species. We examined fish community composition, fine-scale distribution, prey availability, diets, and biochemical tracers for dominant fishes from study areas with medium-high nutrient levels (mesotrophic, Fairport study area), and low nutrient levels (oligotrophic, Erie study area). This multi-year database (2011-2013) provides the ability to contrast years with wide variation in rainfall, winter ice-cover, and thermal stratification. In addition, multiple indicators of dietary and distributional responses to environmental variability will allow resource managers to select the most informative approach for addressing specific climate change questions.  Our results support the incorporation of some relatively simple and cost-efficient approaches into existing agency monitoring programs to track the near-term condition status of fish and fish community composition by functional groupings. Other metrics appear better suited for understanding longer-term changes, and may take more resources to implement on an ongoing basis. Although we hypothesized that dietary overlap and similarity in selected species would be sharply different during thermal stratification and hypoxic episodes, we found little evidence of this. Instead, to our surprise, this study found that fish tended to aggregate at the edges of hypoxia, highlighting potential spatial changes in catch efficiency of the fishery.  This work has had several positive impacts on a wide range of resource management and stakeholder activities, most notably in Lake Erie. The results were instrumental in the development of an interim decision rule for dealing with data collected during hypoxic events to improve stock assessment of Yellow Perch. In addition, novel findings from this study regarding spatial and temporal variability in hypoxia have aided US-Environmental Protection Agency in the development of a modified sampling protocol to more accurately quantify the central basin hypoxic zone, and this directly addressed a goal of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 2012 to reduce the extent and severity of hypoxia. Finally, the study areas developed in this project formed the basis for food web sampling in the 2014 bi-national Coordinated Science and Monitoring Initiative work in Lake Erie.

The Midwest is not only experiencing an increase in average temperatures and precipitation, but also an increase in the frequency of extreme events, such as heat waves and floods. Forecasting the potential impacts of the changes over the next 25 to 50 years will be important for decision makers and landowners seeking to minimize the impacts to infrastructure and to the habitats themselves and prepare for the future. Changes in flood frequency threaten habitat management infrastructure and actions, while also carrying large loads of sediment and nutrients into sensitive habitats. The combination of acute damage associated with flooding and chronic impacts of sedimentation and eutrophication threaten habitats and the species that depend upon them. For conservation lands like national wildlife refuges, these threats undermine the mission of conservation of habitat and species for the enjoyment of the American people.  The goal of this project is to develop a vulnerability assessment of watersheds and protected areas in the Upper Mississippi Watershed by synthesizing the impacts of projected changes in climate and land use (i.e., increased flooding, sedimentation and eutrophication). Further, researchers will work with resource managers in applying concepts of adaptive capacity to the management of specific protected areas.

To better anticipate these changes, there is a need to compile both short- and long-term stream temperature data for managers to gain an understanding of baseline conditions, historic trends, and future projections. Unfortunately, many agencies lack sufficient resources to compile, conduct quality assurance and control, and make accessible stream temperature data collected through routine monitoring. Yet, pooled data from many sources, even if temporally and spatially inconsistent, can have great value both in the realm of stream temperature and aquatic response. The NorEaST web portal was developed to serve as a coordinated, multi-agency regional framework to map and store continuous stream temperature locations and data for New England, Mid Atlantic, and Great Lakes states. NorEaST consists of a mapper where the public can view locations and metadata for current and historic stream temperature monitoring sites, a database where data stewards can store and manage their data, and web services to connect, communicate, and serve data for use in analysis and applications. Currently, stream temperature monitoring locations and metadata can be viewed for more than 10,000 monitoring locations across 30 states, contributed by 40 different organizations.

First, they can undergo adaptive evolutionary change. Second, they can adjust their phenotype via non-evolutionary pathways. Both of these factors could substantially change species climate change vulnerability rankings. In this proposal, we will draw from a wide range of existing data to incorporate the ability of species to adjust their phenotype to climate change into vulnerability assessments.

Although some variability in fish catches is expected across factors such as location and season, we know less about how large-scale disturbances like climate change will influence population variability.  The Laurentian Great Lakes in North America are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world, and they have experienced major changes due to fluctuations in pollution and nutrient loadings, exploitation of natural resources, introductions of non-native species, and shifting climatic patterns.  In this project, we analyzed established long-term data about important fish populations from across the Great Lakes basin, including from Oneida Lake in NY, Lake Michigan, and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Our objective was to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in fish catches from large freshwater lakes that have experienced large-scale changing conditions.  We evaluated analytical approaches with the potential to disentangle sources of variability in standardized monitoring data.  Specifically, we considered 1) how the decomposition of spatial and temporal variation in fish catches can be used to measure a response to perturbation; 2) how truncation of population age structure can alter population oscillations which may shift how a population is affected by environmental fluctuations; and 3) how the composition of a fish community may respond to a suite of environmental drivers through time. Using long-term gill-net data for walleye, we found that average catch and variance structure differed before and after large-scale perturbations.

These changes have direct implications for economically important wildlife, such as deer and waterfowl. Deer hunting alone contributes $482 million annually to Wisconsin\u2019s economy.   The goal of this project is to identify how winter severity, snowpack, and lake ice could change through the mid- and late-21st century, and how species such as the white-tailed deer and mallard duck will respond. Because currently available climate data is at too coarse a scale to provide information on future conditions for the Great Lakes, researchers transformed these models from a global-scale to a regional-scale.    Using these models, researchers found that the region could experience substantial warming, reduced lake ice cover, and increased precipitation, with more precipitation falling as rain than snow, among other changes. Snow/ice cover limit foraging by waterfowl, thereby regulating the timing/intensity of migration and their distributions during non-breeding season. Reductions in weather severity could result in delayed autumn-winter migration for dabbling ducks, which would increase foraging pressures on wetlands in the Great Lakes region \u2013 highlighting the importance of protecting these wetlands. These changes in migration patterns could also lead to potentially significant economic losses in southern flyway states, as ducks may stay in the Great Lakes region during the winter months. The primary wintertime stressors for deer are air chill and snow depth, with extreme winters triggering population declines.  Changes in wildlife abundance and distribution can incur dramatic ecological, societal, and economic impacts. Warming may support expanded deer populations and overgrazing, while elevating infectious disease threats to deer. Annually in the U.S., 13.4 million people participate in deer and migratory bird hunting, generating $21.5 billion in revenue, with the hunting industry supporting 681,000 jobs.    Predictions of the future distribution of ducks and other wildlife in the region will help guide the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Ducks Unlimited, and other stakeholders in developing conservation and adaptation strategies for vulnerable species and in mitigating the potential economic losses that might result from changes in species distribution.

Known as phenology, the timing of these events is very sensitive to changes in climate (and changes in one species\u2019 phenology can impact entire food webs and ecosystems). Shifts in phenology have been described as a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the temporal and spatial responses of wildlife to climate change impacts. Thus phenology provides one of the strongest indicators of the adaptive capacity of organisms (or the ability of organisms to cope with future environmental conditions).  In this study, researchers are exploring how the timing and occurrence of a number of highly migratory marine animals is changing due to a series of climatic and ecological shifts. First, using existing long-term historical data series, they will determine the direction and magnitude of how migration, abundance, or other phenological factors have changed for marine mammals, sea turtles, and fishes that migrate into the Gulf of Maine on a seasonal basis. Because marine animals are inherently difficult to detect, the team will apply dynamic occupancy models to evaluate seasonal migration patterns and habitat use across multiple habitats in the Gulf of Maine region. The project team will also synthesize regional information on a key, ecologically-important prey fish, sandlance, whose timing and abundance is a strong predictor of the occurrence and behavior of predator species targeted in this study as well as a range of other regional fish and wildlife of conservation and management concern. Results from this component of the project will identify coastal fish and wildlife species that are relatively more or less able to adapt and thus potentially vulnerable to climate change; determine the likely primary drivers of those changes; and identify data gaps and future monitoring needs. Ultimately, this information will be available and useful for regional coastal management and adaptation decisions that will allow managers to effectively plan for the future.   In a second component of the project, researchers will focus specifically on changes in migration patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale. While shifts in the distribution and time of recurring life events are adaptive responses that may help species cope with climate impacts, they can also lead to changes in how species interact with humans. The North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered whale species on the planet. In the North Atlantic Ocean, ship strikes and entanglements with commercial fishing gear represent fatal threats to right whales. Recent reports suggest that North Atlantic right whale migration patterns have changed. Many researchers posit that shifts in migration are responsible for recent increases in the overlap between right whales and human activities, especially fishing. To help understand how changes in right whale movements and behaviors may overlap with ship traffic, and thus put the animals at risk of encountering vessels, we will combine right whale habitat models with ship traffic maps. The end result will be a set of maps identifying risk levels.

The goal of this project was to develop a framework to identify demographic sensitivities and assess the vulnerability of grassland bird species to future climate change. To do so, the researchers developed a strong partnership among managers and researchers to understand how climate change might impact the conservation and management planning of grassland birds throughout the Northeast CASC region and identify potentially vulnerable species. Using input from managers, the team focused their efforts on two grassland indicator species of high conservation interest: Henslow\u2019s Sparrows and Bobolinks. They developed spatially-explicit and temporally dynamic species distribution models for these indicator species and evaluated the effects of past and future climate on their populations. Finally, they studied how weather and extreme events (e.g., drought and flooding) effect the breeding success of grassland birds across North America.  By incorporating information on future climate change, the project team has identified regions where Henslow's Sparrows, a species of increasing conservation concern, are likely to face unsuitable conditions for reproduction. In addition, they have identified areas that will serve as likely refugia for this species in the future.

Understanding how climate change will impact natural and human communities is a crucial part of decision making and management related to the protection of our coasts.   In a collaborative project between the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NA LCC) and the Northeast Climate Science Center, researchers compiled existing threshold information on priority coastal fish, wildlife, and plant species as well as coastal habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and Caribbean in response to sea level rise and storm projections. As the effects of climate change on ecological and human communities grow, the possibility of crossing tipping points or thresholds of viability increases the potential for rapid and possibly irreversible changes in ecosystems. Therefore, understanding thresholds related to climate change is critical for facilitating conservation and management actions, which could help to prevent more costly and possibly catastrophic effects in the near (years to decades) and distant (decades to centuries) future. The compilation of this information will help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how natural systems will respond to climate change and how land and resource management decisions could potentially help these species.

Project goals were performed by: 1) Explicitly incorporating land use and climate change projections into hydrologic models to determine effects on stream flow, including changes in streamflow volumes, timing of runoff, and frequency of extreme events; 2) Developing economic and physical measures of floodplain performance that captured the environmental services provided and the losses associated with changing flow regimes, 3) Evaluating how the effectiveness of green infrastructure strategies, including floodplain protection and storage, would alter these effects, 4) Developing a structured decision-making framework that incorporates short-term streamflow forecasting, environmental services damage functions, and adaptive management strategies.

The search to acquire this information was two-fold. One portion of the search dealt with an online literature search for published peer-reviewed articles for the period of approximately 2000 to present. The second portion of the search dealt with contacting US Geological Survey (USGS) Water Science Centers and state institutions to request information on current research projects dealing with this topic that have not yet been published or are currently in publication. Geographic location was considered during the search, and only projects and publications taking place within one of the LCC\u2019s were acquired. The two LCC\u2019s cover partial states in some cases, but searches were conducted for the state as a whole if any portion of the state fell within one of the two LCC's. In addition, relevant publications were obtained for southern Ontario, Canada. An outline for search methodology, including sources and keywords, was used to keep the search process consistent and well-documented. In addition, manual filtering of results was required to ensure that they were both contextually and geographically relevant.  While the effort is likely not entirely exhaustive, the methodology entailed a progression of searches using multiple search engines and resources that upon completion did not return any results that had not already been acquired. The software tool EndNote was selected for compiling the database as this tool assisted in streamlining the process of publication retrieval during the literature search. It also standardized the way in which publications were recorded and provided a means to organize, reduce redundancy, and search the database. The resulting products for each LCC were aggregated to produce one final EndNote library. The library was categorized by geographic location but can be categorized using various criteria and keyword searches within EndNote. Through cooperation with the Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA), a searchable format geared toward the general end-user can be generated.

There are two general approaches of downscaling: dynamical and statistical.

Many past studies have evaluated the performance of these two broad approaches of downscaling with respect to climate variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation), but few have translated these evaluations to ecological metrics that managers use to make decisions in planning for climate change. This study uses maple syrup production as a case study for evaluating how these two downscaling techniques perform in terms of projecting changes in the tapping season. Maple syrup producers are interested in how climate change will affect their industry. Our results will give them a sense of the range they can expect for different aspects of the tapping season (timing of tap date, length of season, quality of sap, etc.).

Overall demand for maple syrup has been rapidly rising as more people appreciate this natural sweetener. Yet because the tapping season is dependent on weather conditions, there is concern about the sustainability of maple sugaring as the region\u2019s climate changes. The distribution of sugar maple could move north into Canada and the sap flow season may become shorter in the future.

For example, plants might be relocated to support pollinator conservation or the restoration of prairies. Some land managers, in an effort to be proactive in the face of changing environmental conditions, are also considering relocating plants to sites that are considered more similar to anticipated future conditions. However, moving plants can be ecologically and economically risky. It\u2019s possible that pests, pathogens, or contaminant weeds can be inadvertently moved along with the target plant material. In 2016, the noxious weed Palmer amaranth was introduced to Minnesota as a contaminant in seed brought in to improve Monarch butterfly and pollinator habitat. This fast growing weed is capable of reducing soybean yields by 78% and corn yields by 91%, and requires costly resources to fight its spread.   One factor that impacts the risk associated with plant movement is the distance between the source of the plant and where it is being relocated to. If the source is located near the translocation site, it is less likely to be contaminated with new weeds or pathogens. The goal of this project is to create a framework for evaluating risk associated with the movement of plant material. The first tier of the framework will describe the future condition of the species, site, or community of concern, if plant movement is implemented and if it is not. The second tier will assess the ecological risks associated with moving plant material. This will include identifying potential pathogens, weeds, and pests that might be associated with plants from different areas and could be inadvertently introduced during translocation, and evaluating the potential harm these species might cause if introduced. The benefit of such a framework will be to greatly reduce the likelihood of unintended introductions of pests and noxious species. It will also take into account the ability of plants to adapt to expected future environmental conditions in their new locations. This work will support a range of stakeholders, including private, state, federal, and non-profit land managers who undertake planting for conservation or restoration.

We predicted the distribution and abundance of common tree species across portions of the eastern U.S. under alternative climate scenarios that varied in the amount of warming by the end of the century from 1.1 to 4.2 degrees celsius. We used a forest landscape change model to forecast changes in tree abundances and distribution in the North Atlantic region of the U.S. while accounting for climate change, succession, and harvest. We then considered a broader region of the U.S. and combined our results with results from previous studies to compare forecasts from three different modeling approaches for the Central Hardwood, Central Appalachian, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regions to determine the level of agreement among models.  Our forecasts for the North Atlantic region indicated tree abundances were affected first by succession and harvest but second by climate. We predicted an increase in Southern and Central Hardwood species and a decrease in Northern Hardwood and spruce-fir forest species under warming climates over the next 300 years. Our comparison of the three modeling approaches across the eastern U.S. indicated high agreement for many species, especially northern species modeled to lose habitat in coming decades. There was agreement among models for decreases in black spruce, balsam fir, northern white cedar, and red spruce, and increases in loblolly pine and some oaks and hickories.

Global change is leading to major shifts in the abundance, distribution, and life history of these species, with concomitant effects on their value to the peoples for whom they are most culturally important.

This project seeks to fill this gap by examining the future of culturally important species as climate conditions change, through close engagement with Indigenous stakeholders. Using an approach known as climate-analogue mapping, researchers will examine regions that are currently experiencing the specific climate conditions that are expected to be experienced by tribal lands in the future, as a means of forecasting potential future climate conditions for tribal lands. Researchers will then conduct a tribal needs assessment by convening a listening session at the United South and Eastern Tribes meeting, during which time they will solicit feedback on the best paths forward for studying and managing species on tribal lands, in light of global change. The team will frame the listening session around the following questions: (1) which species and phenomena should be studied; (2) at what spatial and temporal scale should they be studied; and (3) what management decisions would be most relevant.  This project will set the stage for the management of culturally important species on tribal lands across North America. Products such as an online interface and physical maps of the climate analogues will allow stakeholders to begin conversations with a common starting point and at least one tangible, common frame of refence.

One reason is that much of its primary habitat, sparse stands of mature pine, has been replaced by development or agriculture. Another is that periodic ground fires, which are important for providing needed forage for the tortoise, have been largely suppressed on the landscape. The gopher tortoise is a \u201ckeystone\u201d species, meaning that its disappearance from the landscape would jeopardize the existence of many other species that make use of its underground burrows.  Besides tortoise habitat, the uplands of the Coastal Plain contain isolated seasonal wetlands that are important for the life cycles of many amphibian species. The state of Georgia would like to conserve more of the landscape for the statewide protection of the gopher tortoise and associated natural communities. The different steps it could take include conservation partnerships formed with private landowners and land purchases as opportunities arise.

This project examined the decision making context, decision making process, and management planning associated with the restoration of open pine ecosystems in the Southeast. To better understand the planning practice associated with this system, we assessed the quality of 35 management plans from federal, state, and non-governmental agencies. We found that newer plans scored higher than older plans, suggesting agencies may be learning to develop better plans over time and indicating older plans should be prioritized for revision. Plans from federal and state agencies scored higher than plans from non-governmental agencies, reflecting differences in agency missions and resources. The fact base scored high across most plans, whereas actions and implementation scored lower. Although agencies tended to perform best on fact base, our results suggest having a strong fact base has little influence on other components. To improve actions and implementation, planners should consider incorporating more stakeholder participation to help them develop better actions and implementation indirectly through improved problem and objective statements.  We also investigated how decisions were being made and what barriers - if any - faced decision makers. To gain this insight, we conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with key decision makers and stakeholders and our findings emphasized the challenge of collaboration between individuals, governmental, and non-governmental organizations. We found discrepancies between groups on everything from objectives and goals, to how decisions are made, the barriers groups are facing, information that is used to make those decisions and where information comes from as well as differences in decision making timing and frequency. Agency managers had firm objectives while landowners/private land managers had flexible objectives that changed based on new goals, knowledge and information. In the same vein, agency managers said it was hard to change their management plans but landowners/private land managers said that their management plans were constantly changing to meet their shifting objectives. Agency managers reported that they had access to all of the information they needed to make \u201cgood\u201d decisions while landowners/private managers said that they wanted and needed more information, specifically better economic and growth data. And although agency managers said climate change was a factor when making decisions, landowners/private land managers said that climate change was not a decision making factor. To bridge the gap between the two groups and increase information sharing, a library of regulatory requirements, scientific data, personal experiences and fiscal information may be a way to align management objectives and goals.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. As part of this project, researchers identified important thresholds for ecosystem changes and highlighted coastal areas in the southeastern U.S. (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, and parts of Florida) where relatively small changes in winter conditions could cause relatively dramatic changes in coastal wetlands. Results indicate that mangrove forest expansion will bring about both above- and below-ground ecosystem changes. The most striking and apparent changes will occur above ground as forests develop and replace grasslands. These above-ground transformations will increase carbon storage and affect certain societal benefits provided by coastal wetlands in the region. The below-ground changes due to mangrove expansion will be more subtle and dependent upon the marsh that is being replaced.

As human populations grow, the demand for urbanized areas will increase, and scientists can help natural resource managers plan for these changes by creating models that predict potential patterns of future urbanization. The Southeast U.S. is experiencing particularly rapid population growth, as a favorable winter climate has drawn millions to the region from other areas of the country over the past several decades. However, the Southeast is also at risk from the effects of climate change, particularly along its vast coastline, where over a quarter of the region\u2019s population lives. Recent studies have called attention to the potential for flooding from sea-level rise to motivate residents to move from low-lying coastal areas to less risky inland locations at higher elevation. To date, no research has explicitly considered how the existing flow of people into the region will interact with the potentially increasing drive to move away from the coast.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service, and state fish and wildlife agency partners have requested that the Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center provide updated urbanization and habitat change scenarios to meet regulatory obligations, as species status assessments and state wildlife action plans, and make facility management decisions. This project will build on prior efforts to develop more comprehensive scenarios of future urbanization patterns in the southeastern U.S. These scenarios will take into account two potentially counteracting phenomenon: 1) an increasing redistribution of people from coastal and low-lying areas as they become more vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and 2) existing migration flows from other parts of the country into the Southeast, which also could change as the climate warms.  The resulting scenarios and maps of potential future urban change will allow natural resource decision makers to visualize and anticipate hotspots of urbanization and population movement across the Southeast in the coming decades.

Tropical island communities are faced with making important decisions related to adaptation that could impact the health of important natural resources and ecosystems. However, a lack of scientific guidance and information complicates these efforts.  To help address this problem, the SE CSC project team will work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PRDNER), University of Puerto Rico, and North Carolina State University (NCSU) on improving the application of downscaled climate projections to help advance the recovery and conservation of amphibians in Puerto Rico.

Implementation of the strategy requires identifying suitable habitat for the species at present and in the future, and ensuring the availability of field-tested protocols for locally supplementing, introducing, and translocating species as necessary.  The main objectives of this project are: (1) to develop an understanding of the eco-physiological limits of these species and the influence of those limits on extinction rates in local patches (i.e., heterogeneous micro-habitats within an ecosystem), and (2) to assess their adaptive capacity (i.e. the ability of the amphibians to adapt to changing environmental conditions).

Unfortunately, many of these ecosystems are increasingly under threat due to rapid human development, and management agencies are increasingly aware of the potential effects that climate change will have on these ecosystems. Natural resource managers and conservation planners can be effective at preserving ecosystems in the face of these stressors only if they can adapt current conservation efforts to increase the overall resilience of the system. Climate change, in particular, challenges many of the basic assumptions used by conservation planners and managers. Previous conservation planning efforts identified and prioritized areas for conservation based on the current environmental conditions, such as habitat quality, and assumed that conditions in conservation lands would be largely controlled by management actions (including no action). Climate change, however, will likely alter important system drivers (temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise) and make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain recent historic conditions in conservation lands into the future. Climate change will also influence the future conservation potential of non-conservation lands, further complicating conservation planning. Therefore, there is a need to develop and adapt effective conservation strategies to cope with the effects of climate and landscape change on future environmental conditions.  Traditional urban growth models are very localized and data-intensive and lack the capability to be applied across large regions. In response to these limitations the North Carolina Cooperative Research Unit began using the USGS SLEUTH urban growth model to develop urbanization scenarios as part of the Southeast Regional Assessment Project (SERAP). Extensive modifications of the model framework and calibration were undertaken that resulted in the ability to rapidly develop urbanization scenarios for very large regions, such as the Appalachian, Caribbean, and Gulf Coastal Plain Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). This new modeling effort allows LCC\u2019s to address fundamental questions that affect conservation planning over decadal time scales.

These changes have the potential to influence the ability of barrier islands to serve as a first-line of defense for the mainland during storm events. Gulf Islands National Seashore, a National Park Service unit in the northern Gulf of Mexico between Florida and Mississippi, is predominantly comprised of barrier islands and faces immediate challenges, including erosion that washes out roads and sand dunes and the adverse impacts on cultural and natural resources from exposure to saltwater. Managers require realistic estimates of both the vulnerability of the park\u2019s natural and cultural resources to these threats, as well as the likelihood of the potential harmful consequences of exposure to these threats.  The goal of this project is to support efficient adaptation planning of vulnerable coastal resources in the Gulf Islands National Seashore region, and to identify research priorities that will help predict future changes to barrier islands. First, researchers will implement an existing adaptation planning framework designed to assist the National Park Service in making effective cultural resource adaptation decisions under a range of budget constraints. This framework includes the use of Optimal Preservation (OptiPres), a model that considers the combined effects of the exposure of resources to threats such as storm surge, and the costs and benefits of various management actions taken to address these threats. Researchers will improve the model by developing better estimates of the frequency of storm events that would result in saltwater inundation of forts and historic buildings at the park. Researchers will also bring together managers and technical experts to evaluate the science-based information needs related to sediment dynamics in the Gulf Islands National Seashore region, and to explore paths forward for addressing these needs.

These include 18 species that are already federally listed as threatened or endangered and four other species petitioned for listing that are scheduled for development of Species Status Assessments (SSAs). Today, south Florida\u2019s pine rockland ecosystem represents less than 3 percent of its original extent. Threats such as saltwater intrusion from hurricanes and sea-level rise pose the greatest risk to the longevity of this ecosystem.  For the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make decisions about the potential listing of a species, they must be able to forecast a species\u2019 responses to potential future environmental conditions, as well as to different conservation and management actions. Yet, for many imperiled species in the pine rocklands, the information needed to complete these forecasts\u2014such as population trends, life history traits, habitat use, and future land use and climate conditions--is often lacking. This is especially problematic for assessments of species resiliency to changes in climate and land use.  When these types of data are lacking, information on habitat quality can be used to help determine how a species will respond to change. This project will evaluate habitat conditions for two species found in the pine rockland ecosystem - the rim rock crowned snake and the key ringneck snake. These species are being considered for federal listing, and very little is known about their ecology and demography. Researchers will identify potential future changes in habitat that could result from different management actions, such as habitat acquisition or restoration, and environmental conditions, such as changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms and rates of sea-level rise. They will then explore the potential impacts of these habitat condition changes on the rim rock crowned snake and key ringneck snake.  This information can be used to develop future habitat condition scenarios in forthcoming SSAs for these species. While this project focuses on these two species of snakes, the results could inform the conservation, management, and recovery of other at-risk species found in the pine rocklands ecosystem.

As urbanized areas expand, they are encroaching on preserved areas, like national wildlife refuges, and are dividing forests into smaller fragments.

However, forests located within urban and suburban areas \u2013 \u201curban forests\u201d are capable of supporting diverse plant and animal life, and could play an increasingly important role in conservation as urbanization continues.  Little is currently known about how specific aspects of urbanization, such as higher temperatures and pollution, affect the quality of forests as habitat for plants and animals. This project will synthesize information on how these factors affect urban forest habitat quality, identify knowledge gaps that impede forest management, and propose future research directions to fill those gaps. Specifically, researchers will review scientific literature to address the following questions: (1) How do factors such as heat and pollution from light, noise, and chemicals, affect forest quality for different plants and animals?; (2) How do factors such as tree pests and invasive plants and animals affect forest quality for different plants and animals?; and (3) How does urban forest size and spatial arrangement interact with these factors to affect forest quality?   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service faces unique challenges in managing urban forest resources, particularly threatened and endangered species, in the rapidly urbanizing Southeast. The results of this project will provide information on the role that urban forests can play in achieving conservation goals, ultimately supporting the Department of the Interior in preparing for the unique challenges of this growing resource and identifying existing knowledge gaps so that funds can be directed towards answering the most crucial questions.

In response to warming winter temperatures, mangroves, which are dominant in warmer climates, are expected to continue migrating northward at the expense of salt marshes, which fare better in cooler climates. The ecological implications and timing of mangrove expansion is not well understood, and coastal wetland managers need information and tools that will enable them to identify and forecast the ecological impacts of this shift from salt marsh to mangrove-dominated coastal ecosystems.  To address this need, researchers will host workshops and leverage existing collaborations with scientists across the northern Gulf of Mexico to develop products that are relevant to resource managers within this transition zone between mangrove forests and salt marshes. First, researchers will leverage a community-curated data network called the Mangrove Migration Network to examine temperature thresholds for damage and mortality for several mangrove species that are common to the region. The winter of 2017-2018 in particular, during which extreme winter temperatures were experienced in the northern Gulf of Mexico, presents an outstanding opportunity to improve our ability to forecast the effects of changing winter temperature extremes on coastal wetlands. Researchers will integrate data from the Gulf of Mexico Mangrove Migration Network to assess the vulnerability of coastal wetlands to changing winter temperature extremes. Second, three workshops will be held with managers throughout the region to identify issues related to mangrove restoration and management in coastal wetlands in Texas, Louisiana, and north Florida. The results of this effort will help federal and state land managers better understand what is happening on the lands they manage, and evaluate alternative management and restoration activities that involve migrating mangroves.

This project assessed the vulnerability of key sea turtle nesting beaches to climate change in the Southeast. Researchers examined previous records of sea turtle nesting locations in the Southeast to identify the characteristics of these beaches, then predicted the future suitability of these beaches for nesting based on projected climate change. Beaches on both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are expected to be very susceptible to change associated with sea-level rise, making it imperitive that we understand how these changes will affect the suitability of nesting sites.   The results of this work can be used to directly inform federal recovery efforts for the loggerhead sea turtle. Identifying locations where beach habitat will no longer be suitable for nesting will help managers determine what action needs to be taken to protect loggerheads, such as moving nests out of highly vulnerable areas. Further, some of the nesting beaches used by loggerheads are also used by other endangered sea turtles, such as the Kemp\u2019s ridley, green, and leatherback sea turtles.

Conservation practitioners and land and wildlife managers must navigate these challenges to make science-informed decisions to advance conservation and adaptation of important natural resources.

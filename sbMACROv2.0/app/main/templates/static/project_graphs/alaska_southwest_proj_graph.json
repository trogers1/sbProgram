These changes in glacier volume and extent will affect the flow and chemistry of coastal rivers, as well as the nearshore marine ecosystem of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  Runoff from glaciers accounts for about half of the land-to-ocean movement of freshwater into the GOA, strongly influencing the freshwater and marine ecosystems along the coast. Runoff from glaciers, for example, significantly impacts the water temperature and clarity of aquatic habitats, which are important conditions for salmon reproduction. Moreover, runoff from glaciers along the GOA is an important factor in the structure of the Alaska Coastal Current, which, in turn, sustains multi-million dollar commercial fisheries, subsistence fisheries, and millions of coastal marine birds and mammals.  Through this project, scientists examined the physical, chemical and biological interconnections that characterize the northern PCTR ecosystem, with particular emphasis on the potential impacts of glacier change in the coastal mountain ranges on surface-water hydrology, biogeochemistry, coastal oceanography and aquatic ecology. Their research reveals a tightly interconnected biophysical system in the northern PCTR, with glaciers as an integral component.

Support for this project was provided by USGS and by local tribal partners including Arctic Village Traditional Council, Gwichyaa Zhee Gwich\u2019in Tribal Council, and the Venetie Village Council. The assessments were also performed in partnership with three regional tribal organizations: the Council of Athabascan Tribal Governments, the Tanana Chiefs Conference, and the Yukon River Intertribal Watershed Council. Each assessment included at least one community tour, interviews with key environmental and health staff, health clinic, water plant and solid waste site tours, school and classroom visits, river surveys, meetings with tribal staff and leadership, and public meetings. The project team also provided Local Environmental Observer Network training for tribal environmental staff and the installation of time lapse cameras to help these communities monitor environmental change.  One important result of this research found that increased temperatures and smoke from a variety of wildfires in these areas over the last several years had become a particular concern for elders, youth and community members with respiratory problems.

Because of their importance to human and natural communities, it is critical to understand how these rivers and their surrounding environments will be affected by climate change and glacier loss. The overarching goal of this project is to research (1) the amount of river water, sediment, nutrients, and organic matter in the Jago, Okpilak, and Hulahula rivers that come from glacier melt, (2) the effects that glacier melt has on terrestrial, aquatic, and coastal ecosystems, and (3) the changes in river processes that occur as glaciers disappear.

While considerable research has gone into assessing how to overcome some of these limitations, results suggest that climate change is already altering the equation, and will likely continue to do so. Some research suggests crop production for some varieties might advance northward in the state, leading to increases in yields and new varieties becoming viable. However, it\u2019s also projected that water stress may become an increasing challenge facing farmers. Further, some crops, such as the burgeoning peony market, are dependent on Alaska\u2019s cool climate and late summer season, and could be negatively impacted by warming temperatures.   Currently available tools are limited in their ability to help Alaska\u2019s farmers adjust to climate change, because they primarily focus on the effects of extreme winter temperatures. However, additional variables, such as day length, thaw dates, freeze dates, growing season length, and occurrence of extreme heat may all affect whether a particular crop can be grown in a particular location. To better support Alaska\u2019s small-scale growers, researchers will work with local farmers to first identify their immediate and long-term needs in relation to ongoing and potential future climate-related changes to crops. Next, researchers will develop fine-scale maps, tools, and datasets that meet these stakeholder-defined needs. This project will include the entire state of Alaska, but will emphasize areas where peony farming occurs. Commercial peony farming has experienced considerable growth in recent years, and it\u2019s estimated that in 2017 growers grossed between $900,000 and $1.8 million in sales. Further, as a perennial, peonies are potentially affected by changes in weather that occur throughout the year.   Alaska\u2019s high-latitude setting places it at the front lines of environmental change.

These hazards have the potential to substantially disrupt the environment and commerce in the region, but more information is needed to determine the likely impacts.   To fill this gap, researchers sought to better understand how coastal processes will be affected by climate change.

Understanding these changes is then critical for understanding and predicting a variety of climate impacts to wildlife and ecosystems. However, little research has been conducted to date to understand how this change may impact high-latitude ecosystems, and, unfortunately, traditional methods used by scientists to measure and characterize drought do not apply to snowfall-dominated areas.

Building on these workshops and previous coastal science studies, the focus is now on communicating key findings to coastal communities, and on developing actionable science strategies to address the identified needs of local communities. Researchers will also explore available tools that could support adaptation planning, such as tools for predicting coastal erosion, identifying storm surge impacts, and understanding wildlife response to a changing climate.

Their survival and reproduction is dependent on sufficient winter habitat and food sources, which may be threatened by climate change.  During the winter, caribou eat lichens (organisms made up of algae and fungus) that grow on the snow-covered ground. Lichens will likely have a complex response to climate change, affected in different ways by factors like changing precipitation, wildfire, and competition with plants. For example, as temperatures warm, there will likely be less snow cover, exposing more of the lichen to caribou. Simultaneously, increased fire frequency could reduce lichen availability.  Moose, on the other hand, eat the twigs of deciduous shrubs that stick up above the snow. Unlike lichen, shrub habitats may actually be affected positively by increased fire. Warmer temperatures and less snow are also likely to increase shrub biomass.  Project researchers are using the Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Model to unravel some of these complex relationships and estimate the effects of climate change on food availability for these two species throughout most of Alaska and parts of Canada (from about 1970-2100). The resulting maps will be divided by land ownership and landscape characteristics to show expected changes in winter food for moose and caribou that will be tailored to and directly useable by natural resource managers as they devise strategies for adapting to a changing climate.

The synthesis on permafrost and infrastructure highlights the need to better integrate data on current and future environmental conditions by bringing together engineers and scientists. The synthesis on ecosystem services, meanwhile, highlights the fact that permafrost is a critical landscape feature that supports drinking water availability, access to hunting and harvest areas, and fish and wildlife habitat.   A second component of this project has focused on synthesizing the distribution of surface water in the northern hemisphere in comparison to permafrost characteristics - such as permafrost extent, ground temperature, and thermokarst occurrence.

These fires were associated with extreme winds and were potentially also influenced by unusually dry conditions during several years leading up to the 2017 events. This fire season brought additional attention and emphasized the vital need for managers in the western U.S. to have access to scientific information on when and where to expect dangerous fire events. Understanding the multiple factors that cause extreme wildfire events is critical to short and long-term forecasting and planning. Seasonal climate measures such as temperature and precipitation are commonly used to explain fire occurrence and impact. However, weather events that produce extreme winds and severe temperatures over short periods of time can also have substantial impacts on fire behavior. In addition, multi-year droughts may increase fire potential by decreasing the amount of moisture in vegetation.   The goal of this project is to investigate the range of factors that may explain the variation in annual fire activity in both forested and non-forested landscapes in California. These factors will include the longer-term effects of extended droughts and the shorter-term effects of intense heat spells, low relative humidity, and extreme winds. In addition, researchers will evaluate the extent to which large fires are associated with particular fire ignition sources. Results should inform improved predictive models to show how long-term drought events and short-term extreme weather could impact future fire activity.   This project will evaluate the relative importance of these environmental factors over the last several decades, across different landscape types in California. Results will provide predictive tools for fire managers, enabling them to better anticipate extreme fire events and update fire-danger warnings.

Understanding and anticipating how warming temperatures will influence future water supply in the Colorado River basin is increasingly important for resource management, particularly in light of recent drought conditions.   The overarching goals of this project are to better understand the influence of temperature on Colorado River streamflow, particularly during droughts, and assist water managers in planning for future droughts. This work expands on a recently completed study, building on that project in two main ways. First, this project extends collaborative work between scientists and Colorado River basin water managers to investigate the range of potential drought conditions under early 21st century warming, using both recent and historical data. For example, with precipitation reconstructions from tree rings for the past 500 years, the team can use a simple hydrologic model to assess the impacts of the longest and most severe droughts of the past on the Colorado River under today\u2019s warmer temperatures. With this information, the project team will contribute to a set of plausible scenarios of future drought that planners can use to help make resource-management decisions. Second, the project is more explicitly examining the drivers of Colorado River drought, with a focus on factors such as the phase of precipitation (rain vs. snow), the timing and rate of snowmelt, and evaporation rates.

Reduced precipitation can also lead to lower water levels in streams and losses in the vegetation that grows alongside riverbanks.   The goal of this project was to identify how hydrologic systems in the Southwest might respond to changes in climate and the degree to which this response is dependent on the characteristics of the hydrologic system. To do this, researchers developed a tool that simulates how quickly water moves from the surface to underground aquifers.  The tool helps identify timeframes and regions where seepage of water into aquifers is likely constant, rather than fluctuating with rainfall patterns or climate. By locating these areas upfront, researchers can exclude them from their analysis and focus water supply forecasting efforts on areas where groundwater is more likely to be affected by changes in rainfall or human uses at the surface.   The model shows that areas with a shallower water table tend to have more variability in the rate at which groundwater supplies are replenished, with secondary effects related to the soil type and the period of variation. In these areas, changes in rainfall and water withdrawal for irrigation or urban use have a bigger impact on groundwater availability. Water resource managers can use this tool to more accurately forecast how much groundwater remains in different watersheds and to determine which systems will be most sensitive to changes in climate and water use. The need for better forecasting is only increasing, as aquifers are increasingly tapped and precipitation patterns are expected to become more variable.

Control and prevention of invasive species is challenging because the risk of invasive plants becoming abundant depends on existing plant communities, climate and weather, land use, and fire history. Moreover, scientific information on invasion risk that does exist has not always been translated into maps that planners and resource managers can use in their decision making.

These models will be used to evaluate variations in historical phenology trends based on time period, plant type, geography, and moisture availability. The team plans to generate a phenology tool that resource managers in the Southwest can use to predict phenology events (e.g. plant green-up) based on a specified climate (historical, future near-term, and long-term). This work will help to ensure that phenological information can be used to inform conservation planning and resource management decisions in the Southwest.

Found in eleven western states, this important yet fragile ecosystem is dominated by sagebrush, but also contains a diversity of native shrubs, grasses, and flowering plants. It provides critical habitat for wildlife like pronghorn and threatened species such as the greater sage-grouse, and is grazed by livestock on public and private lands. However, this landscape is increasingly threatened by shifts in wildfire patterns, the spread of invasive grasses, and changing climate conditions. While sagebrush is slow to recover after fires, non-native grasses such as cheatgrass thrive in post-fire conditions and the spread of these species can increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires. These changes to the sagebrush ecosystems have implications for big game, threatened wildlife, and ranching.  To address this growing concern, resource managers will often try to limit the spread of exotic grasses after fire events by applying herbicides, or will help native species recover through seeding or planting. However, these treatments have mixed results, and poor success is often attributed to droughts, which make it more difficult for seeds and native plants to survive; to the limited amount of time in which these treatments can be applied (usually in the first year after a fire); or because the seeds or plants used aren\u2019t adapted to the environmental conditions of the location where they\u2019re applied.  The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the factors that affect post-fire treatment success. Researchers will use data collected from more than 300 fires over the last 40 years, after which treatments were applied. They will identify the impacts of drought on those treatments, how incorporating information on drought forecasts or extending the period over which treatments are applied could have altered the outcomes, and how managers can better select plant material that will be more adaptable to the conditions of planting locations.

This project was jointly funded by the Southwest, Northwest, and North Central CASCs.", "items": {}}, {"num_items": 0, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5937201ae4b0f6c2d0d89a85", "node": 93, "name": "Learning From Recent Snow Droughts To Improve Forecasting of Water Availability for People and Forests", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2017", "summary": "In the dry southwestern United States, snowmelt plays a crucial role as a water source for people, vegetation, and wildlife. However, snow droughts significantly lower snow accumulations, disrupting these critical water supplies for local communities and ecosystems. Despite its large influence on land- and water-resource management, snow drought has only recently been properly defined and its historical distribution and effects on key natural resources are essentially unknown. To remedy this serious knowledge gap, project researchers are examining the causes, effects, and forecastability of snow drought to provide needed scientific information and guidance to planners and decision makers.   The central goals of this proposal are to better quantify the impact of snow droughts on municipal and ecosystem water supplies and improve the scientific information accessible to a wide range of resource managers. The project consists of three primary objectives: 1) Document the types, frequencies, and proximate causes of historical snow drought using snow and climate observations, 2) Assess streamflow forecasting abilities following snow drought using the operational regression-based forecasts used by water management agencies, and 3) Identify areas where streamflow forecast skill is improved by incorporating snow drought information.   Preliminary analyses indicate that several different types of snow droughts occur in the Southwest, arising from a variety of different factors. \u201cDry snow drought\u201d is caused by a lack of winter precipitation needed to accumulate snow. \u201cWarm snow drought\u201d can be caused by early snowmelt or by precipitation falling as rain rather than snow. The project team is also using SNOTEL data in models to predict the occurrence of these different types of snow droughts across the Southwest. Their next steps will be to determine how these different types of snow drought affect streamflow forecasting and develop strategies to improve these forecasts.", "items": {}}, {"num_items": 0, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5012a51ce4b05140039e02cb", "node": 94, "name": "Identifying the Vulnerability of Birds and Reptiles to Changes in Climate in the Southwest", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "Biodiversity is declining worldwide, and this trend could potentially become more severe as climate conditions change. An integral component of proactive adaptive management planning requires forecasts of how changes in climate will affect individual species. This need has been identified my multiple federal agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Forest Service.   The goal of this project was to assist land and wildlife managers in anticipating which species are most vulnerable to changes in climate in the Southwest, and how resources can best be invested to facilitate adaptation. Researchers evaluated the current and future breeding ranges of 15 bird and 16 reptile species in the western U.S. using a new approach that models variables such as temperature and precipition, terrain ruggedness and soil type, and plants that are commonly associated with each species.   Results showed that two-thirds of the species examined could be expected to experience a decrease in range, while one-third could experience an increase. Climate variables were found to play a bigger role than landscape or plant variables in determining changes in species range. Researchers also found that as available habitat patches for birds and reptiles become more isolated, their ranges also contract. This finding suggests that strategic management actions focused on conserving and restoring connections between habitat patches could help lessen the severity of the projected range contractions.

These saltmarshes, mudflats, and shallow bays are not only critical for wildlife, but they also provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Today, sea-level rise, more frequent and stronger storms, saltwater intrusion, and warming water temperatures are among the threats that are altering these important habitats.   To support future planning and conservation of California\u2019s near-shore habitats, researchers examined current weather patterns, elevations, tides, and sediments at these sites to see how they affect plants and animals. Researchers then projected how changes in climate and sea-level rise might alter this delicate balance. Together, this information can be used by California\u2019s coastal land managers to understand the vulnerability of these ecosystems to changing conditions, and plan ahead to implement adaptive management strategies.   These efforts provided the baseline information need to support a follow-on project titled \u201cEffects of Sea-Level Rise and Extreme Storms on California Coastal Habitats: Part 2\u201d.

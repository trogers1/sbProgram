These woodlands have been identified by several stakeholders, including natural resource management entities, federal and state agencies, and numerous tribal nations, as important ecosystems that are currently threatened by land treatments, changes in disturbance regimes such as drought and fire, and widespread tree mortality. Currently there exist competing objectives for the management of these systems, including the desire to preserve pinyon-juniper viability as climate conditions continue to shift, as well as the need to track these systems to ensure their ranges do not expand into historically non-forested areas. The Southern Rockies Landscape Conservation Cooperative (SRLCC), which considers pinyon-juniper woodlands among their focal resources, recently conducted vulnerability assessments of these woodlands in the four corners and upper Rio Grande landscapes. In a series of workshops to discuss these assessments, stakeholders identified the need for synthesizing regional knowledge of pinyon-juniper woodland structure and dynamics, which can differ dramatically due to the geographically broad distribution of this ecosystem.   The goal of this project is to synthesize the state of the science on pinyon-juniper woodland ecosystems by examining previous research and management practices to identify what is known and what remains to be studied. To do this, researchers are compiling published, peer-reviewed, scientific manuscripts and agency reports on the structure, function, and management of pinyon-juniper ecosystems into a comprehensive database. Unpublished material from land managers who work with pinyon-juniper systems, libraries at the US Forest Service, USGS, and other agencies will also be incorporated. The end product will be a state of the science report evaluating the influence current management decisions and climatic conditions have on possible adaptation strategies for pinyon-juniper woodlands.", "items": {}}, {"num_items": 15, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/596f5354e4b0d1f9f0645e5d", "node": 1, "name": "Building Social and Ecological Resilience to Climate Change in Southwestern Colorado: Phase 2", "casc": "North Central CASC", "fy": "2017", "summary": "In southwestern Colorado, land managers anticipate the impacts of climate change to include higher temperatures, more frequent and prolonged drought, accelerated snowmelt, larger and more intense fires, more extreme storms, and the spread of invasive species.

This project builds on the project \u201cBuilding Social and Ecological Resilience to Climate Change in southwestern Colorado: Phase 1\u201d. Phase 1 focused on developing integrated social-ecological science and adaptation strategies for four target landscapes: spruce-fir forests, pinyon-juniper woodlands, sagebrush scrublands, and seeps, springs and wetlands.   Phase 2 will further advance adaptation strategy development in the region and share the results with other communities, land managers, and decision-makers. Specifically, researchers will identify concrete actions that can be taken to carry out each adaptation strategy, and will develop solutions to address barriers identified by stakeholders in Phase 1 that could impede implementation. Ultimately, this project will result in landscape-scale conservation goals and actions that conserve key species, ecosystems, and resources, address the economic and social systems of local communities, and provide science resources for natural resource managers in the face of a changing climate.", "items": {"5c093fb2e4b0815414d0e101": {"title": "Pinus edulis Feast/Famine scenario change categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c093fb2e4b0815414d0e101"}, "5c094b1ae4b0815414d10c8e": {"title": "Time Series of the Anomalies in Soil Moisture and Runoff Between 1950-2099 for the Pinyon-Juniper Ecosystem of Southwest Colorado Under Three Future Climate Scenarios", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c094b1ae4b0815414d10c8e"}, "5c093c23e4b0815414d0d31e": {"title": "Artemisia tridentata spp. wyomingensis Feast/Famine Scenario Change Categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c093c23e4b0815414d0d31e"}, "5c093d3ae4b0815414d0d701": {"title": "Artemisia tridentata spp. wyomingensis Hot/Dry Scenario Change Categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c093d3ae4b0815414d0d701"}, "5c0940a3e4b0815414d0e3f7": {"title": "Pinus edulis Warm/Wet Scenario Change Categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c0940a3e4b0815414d0e3f7"}, "5c0947d3e4b0815414d10405": {"title": "Time Series of the Anomalies in Temperature and Precipitation Metrics Between 1950-2099 for Southwestern Colorado Under Three Future Climate Scenarios", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c0947d3e4b0815414d10405"}, "5c09258ce4b0815414d0bca9": {"title": "Juniperus osteosperma Feast/Famine scenario change categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c09258ce4b0815414d0bca9"}, "5c093508e4b0815414d0c532": {"title": "Artemisia tridentata spp. vaseyana Warm/Wet Scenario Change Categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c093508e4b0815414d0c532"}, "5c093485e4b0815414d0c300": {"title": "Juniperus osteosperma Hot/Dry Scenario Change Categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c093485e4b0815414d0c300"}, "5c093445e4b0815414d0c1f2": {"title": "Juniperus osteosperma Warm/Wet Scenario Change Categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c093445e4b0815414d0c1f2"}, "5c0940f0e4b0815414d0e3f9": {"title": "Pinus edulis Hot/Dry Scenario Change Categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c0940f0e4b0815414d0e3f9"}, "5c094c20e4b0815414d10dbb": {"title": "Time Series of the Anomalies in Soil Moisture, Runoff, Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Between 1950-2099 in the Upper Gunnison Basin in Southwest Colorado Under Three Future Climate Scenarios", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c094c20e4b0815414d10dbb"}, "5c0934cbe4b0815414d0c467": {"title": "Artemisia tridentata spp. vaseyana Feast/Famine Scenario Change Categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c0934cbe4b0815414d0c467"}, "5c093bbce4b0815414d0d26e": {"title": "Artemisia tridentata spp. vaseyana Hot/Dry Scenario Change Categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c093bbce4b0815414d0d26e"}, "5c093cd8e4b0815414d0d4b9": {"title": "Artemisia tridentata spp. wyomingensis Warm/Wet Scenario Change Categories (2035)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c093cd8e4b0815414d0d4b9"}}}, {"num_items": 0, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b33c0bfe4b040769c173019", "node": 2, "name": "Identifying Characteristics of Actionable Science for Drought Planning and Adaptation", "casc": "North Central CASC", "fy": "2018", "summary": "Changing climate conditions can make water management planning and drought preparedness decisions more complicated than ever before. Resource managers can no longer rely solely on historical data and trends to base their actions, and are in need of science that is relevant to their specific needs and can directly inform important planning decisions. Questions remain, however, regarding the most effective and efficient methods for extending scientific knowledge and products into management and decision-making.  This study analyzes two unique cases of water management to better understand how science can be translated into resource management actions and decision-making.  In particular, this project seeks to understand 1) the characteristics that make science actionable and useful for water resource management and drought preparedness, and 2) the ideal types of scientific knowledge or science products that facilitate the use of science in management and decision-making.  The first case study focuses on beaver mimicry, an emerging nature-based solution that increases the presence of wood and woody debris in rivers and streams to mimic the actions of beavers. This technique has been rapidly adopted by natural resource managers as a way to restore riparian areas, increase groundwater infiltration, and slow surface water flow so that more water is available later in the year during hotter and dryer months. The second case study focuses on an established research program, Colorado Dust on Snow, that provides water managers with scientific information explaining how the movement of dust particles from the Colorado Plateau influences hydrology and the timing and intensity of snow melt and water runoff into critical water sources. This program has support from and is being used by several water conservation districts in the state.  Understanding how scientific knowledge translates into action and decision-making in these cases will strengthen our knowledge of actionable science in the context of drought and its impacts on ecosystems. The project team will gather qualitative data through stakeholder interviews and will conduct an extensive literature review. Findings from these efforts will also be incorporated into a broader Intermountain West synthesis effort to determine and assess commonalities and differences among socio-ecological aspects of drought adaptation and planning.", "items": {}}, {"num_items": 0, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/504a0af9e4b02b6b9f7bd9a7", "node": 3, "name": "Incorporating Adaptive Capacity into Decision-Making in the North Central U.S.", "casc": "North Central CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "Managers already face uncertainty when making decisions about how to best manage natural resources.

So too is identifying ways in which managers can better incorporate information on climate and the vulnerability of resources into their decision-making.   This project sought to improve decision-making in the North Central region by developing an approach to managing natural resources that acknowledges the uncertainties that exist and incorporates the adaptive capacity and vulnerability of resources to climate change. To meet this goal, researchers assessed (1) the key factors that affect the ability of human and ecological communities to adapt to climate change; (2) the current vulnerability of communities to changing conditions; and (3) the current risk assessment methodologies being used by managers in the region.

The basin has a long history of development and diversion of water resources, meaning that streamflow records that reflect natural, unmanaged flows over the past century have been rare. As a result, research on the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation in driving droughts and surface water variability in the Missouri River Basin has lagged behind similar work done in other major basins in the country, and has hindered drought planning efforts.   To address this need, researchers will use tree-rings to develop reconstructions of historic, natural streamflow in the Upper Missouri River Basin. This will be the first such network of hydrologic reconstructions for the basin. Specifically, the tree-ring analysis will provide information on precipitation, temperature, and streamflow for the basin going back 800 years. This historical information will then be used to explore the drivers of drought and periods of high flow in the basin, beyond just precipitation. For example, evidence suggests that temperature is an increasingly important driver of drought, and an analysis of the impacts of warming temperatures on streamflow can be used to help managers anticipate future impacts on water supplies in the basin. Lastly, researchers will work closely with engineers and water managers with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to integrate information on droughts and natural variability in streamflow into their water operations and drought planning efforts. Through this effort, researchers will seek to address questions such as \u201cwhat are the impacts to current water operations under severe droughts, like the 1930s Dust Bowl or 1500s megadrought?\u201d and \u201chow could operations be changed to improve water management for droughts like these, given projected future warming?\u201d.

In recognition of this challenge, regional drought early warning systems (DEWS) and related drought-information tools have been developed under the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS). Despite the existence of many tools and information sources, however, the factors that influence if a tool(s) is (are) used, which tools are used, and how much benefit those tools provide remain poorly understood. Using the Upper Colorado River DEWS as a case study, this study investigated how water, land, and fire managers select from among many available tools.  The Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) was one of the first pilot areas, beginning in 2009, for implementation of a regional drought early warning system (DEWS) under the NIDIS program, which now supports eight regional DEWS. (In 2016, the UCRB DEWS was expanded and reconfigured into the Intermountain West DEWS). The selection of the UCRB for a pilot DEWS reflects the regional importance of drought monitoring for managing water supply for agriculture and other uses, and the need for effective decision support related to drought. New drought-information tools were developed specifically for the UCRB DEWS, and a number of others have been created since 2009, adding to the pre-existing toolkit for drought decision making. The various tools that are now available in the Upper Colorado River Basin region can be expected to be more or less suitable for different decision makers\u2019 needs. As a result, the broad decision context of this case study (managing drought) was fixed, but the information needs of users varied. This provided the opportunity to examine the varied choices decision makers make about which of the available tools to use or not use.  The research identified four broad categories of tool use that map to particular decision contexts. Water supply managers, land managers with rangeland management responsibilities, land managers focused on ecological health, and fire managers each use a suite of indicators and tools that match their particular decision context and timeframe at which they make decisions. Important differences also emerged in how respondents find out about tools, with water managers reporting strong inter-agency connections while land managers tend to rely on information from others within their agencies. Fire managers also play a key role in keeping others in the land management agencies informed about drought.

Maintaining healthy herds not only supports the ecosystems where these species are found, but also the hunting and wildlife watching communities. For example, in Wyoming, big game hunting contributed over $300 million to the state\u2019s economy in 2015. Yet as climate conditions change, the quantity, quality, and timing of vegetation available to mule deer, elk, and other ungulates, known as forage, could shift. It\u2019s possible that these changes could have cascading impacts on the behavior and population sizes of many species.  A key strategy used by managers to improve forage availability and adapt to change is the implementation of habitat treatments. These treatments include prescribed fire, forest thinning, and removal of invasive weeds, and are currently being planned to counteract the expected decline in mule deer habitat in the Kemmerer-Cokeville Area of southwestern Wyoming. To ensure that these activities are effective in meeting their goals, it is important for managers to have information on how forage conditions are already changing due to climate variability, and what any potential tradeoffs associated with these techniques may be.  Focusing on Montana and Wyoming, this project aims to meet this need by achieving three objectives. First, researchers will prepare summaries of past and future changes in forage by watershed, herd, and hunting area for both states. These summaries will help managers prioritize areas for management by providing baseline information about the direction, degree, and certainty of change in the quality and timing of forage. Second, researchers will assess changes in forage conditions in aspen, sagebrush, and mixed mountain shrub habitat in southwest Wyoming. They will develop maps of future forage based on scenarios that reflect probabilities of important weather patterns (such as drought), the current distribution of invasive cheatgrass (which decreases forage quality), and expected effects of planned habitat treatments, such as prescribed fire. Lastly, researchers will use these maps to evaluate the effects of treatment options on mule deer migration, fawning, and summer habitat, and on elk calving, migration, and habitat use.  The results of this project will be useful to a broad range of managers, including those with the states of Wyoming and Montana, and with federal agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Land Management.

While models can be used to predict the types of impacts that climate change might have on a landscape, uncertainty remains surrounding factors such as how quickly changes will occur and how specific resources will respond.   In order to plan for this uncertain future, managers have begun to use a tool known as scenario planning. In this approach, a subset of global climate model projections are selected that represent a range of plausible future climate scenarios for a particular area. Through a series of facilitated workshops, managers can then explore different management options under each scenario, enabling them to be proactive in the face of uncertainty.

The goal of this project is to identify best practices for developing actionable science results, which are often built around strong stakeholder engagement. Researchers will evaluate the different processes \u2013 including mechanisms of stakeholder engagement \u2013 that have been employed by the North Central Climate Science Center to provide managers with actionable science that supports climate adaptation planning. By identifying best practices for stakeholder engagement, this project will support the North Central CSC\u2019s mission to ensure that their science directly addresses on-the-ground management needs.   This project team is part of the North Central Climate Science Center\u2019s Adaptation Foundational Science Area Team, which supports foundational research and advice, guidance, and technical assistance to other NC CSC projects as they address climate science challenges that are important for land managers and ecologists in the region.

The future of these and other species is closely tied to the future of sagebrush. Yet this important ecosystem has already been affected by fire, invasive species, land use conversion, and now, climate change.   In the western U.S., temperatures are rising and precipitation patterns are changing. However, there is currently a limited ability to anticipate the impacts of climate change on sagebrush. Current methods suffer from a range of weakness that limits the reliability of results. In fact, the current uncertainty about future changes in sagebrush has been identified as a critical constraint on climate change adaptation planning in the West. To address this need, researchers are forecasting the effects of climate change on the distribution and abundance of sagebrush. Researchers will integrate several modeling approaches that take into account historical data, disturbances such as fire, and changes in temperature and precipitation. This integrated method will produce more accurate estimates of future sagebrush distribution and abundance.   The results of this research will be effectively communicated to land managers so that they can inform conservation planning, and sage-grouse management in particular, across the Intermountain West. Improved sagebrush forecasting will increase the capacity of land managers to prioritize future investments in sagebrush conservation and management by identifying areas where sagebrush are most and least vulnerable to climate change.

However, to date, limited data and the uncertain effects of climate change have hindered predictions of future streamflow.  Through this project, scientists developed a model that provides a way to estimate future stream low flow (streamflow during a period of prolonged dryness) by categorizing streams based on their physical characteristics. While the model is based on data from gaged streams (i.e., those fitted with measuring devices to monitor streamflow), it allows researchers to also predict streamflow at ungaged (unmonitored) sites and thus develop island- or state-wide predictions of stream response to future rainfall conditions.  Researchers used the model to forecast flow changes in Maui streams under two possible end-of-century future climate scenarios. Results indicate that in areas where rainfall is projected to decrease in the future, stream low flow may decrease by more than 50 percent in some areas, and habitat for native species may decrease by more than 25 percent in some streams.

Several climate-related factors are influencing Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s landscapes and contributing to these changes. These include climate change, climate variability, and drought (referred to collectively as CCVD). Climate variability describes how the climate fluctuates on a yearly basis around average values, while climate change describes patterns of long-term continuous change in the average.   While it is understood that CCVD will exert a growing influence on Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s ecosystems and communities, there is currently little information on the historic impacts of CCVD in the region. Improving our understanding of past conditions will help Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s natural resource managers better prepare for the future impacts of CCVD on ecosystems and communities. For example, invasive plant species in Hawai\u02c8i tend to be more fire-prone. If CCVD contributes to the spread of invasives, there may be more wildfires, and managers may need to revise current fire management strategies.   This project will use newly available datasets and tools to improve our understanding of the impacts of historic CCVD in Hawai\u02c8i. This information will then be used to assess the potential ecological and social impacts of CCVD, with an emphasis on fire risk.

Hawaiian nearshore reefs generate about $800 million in annual revenue, not including the ecosystem services they provide - such as critical habitat for diverse fish species and buffering coasts from storm surges. The Hawaiian economy depends on healthy coral ecosystems, yet reefs are currently facing multiple threats, including changing climate conditions, local land-based pollution, and sediment erosion.  Erosion of soils into nearshore coastal zones is a chief concern facing land managers in West Maui. Intermittent rainfall can carry sediment from sources such as dirt roads, agricultural fields, streambanks, and disturbed forests into estuaries and the ocean. These sediments can block light that corals need for photosynthesis, essentially smothering them. Sediment also affects coastal user enjoyment by reducing water quality.  The goal of this project was to map, monitor, and analyze recent and historic rainfall to estimate sources of sediment for watersheds in West Maui. Researchers described how much sediment was entering the water from different land-based sources, to create a sediment budget for two watersheds in West Maui. Researchers found that current sediment deposition into coastal waters is likely due to the erosion of streambank terraces located downstream of former agricultural fields. These terraces are remnants of old agricultural land management practices in which soil and rock waste were pushed from fields into streams. It\u2019s estimated that this source results in over 90 dump truck loads of fine sediment entering West Maui\u2019s nearshore environment each year.

The threat of rising sea levels to the essential infrastructure and cultural assets of island communities is well known. However, inadequate information limits the ability of resource managers to predict and prepare for the impacts of sea-level rise and associated inundation.

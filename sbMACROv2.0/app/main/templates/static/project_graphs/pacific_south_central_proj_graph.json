Some projections estimate that future sea-level rise could exceed the average elevation of these islands by 2100. Already, residents are facing extreme high tides and 16 foot swells that flood the islands with saltwater, damaging homes and infrastructure and contaminating the freshwater supply.  Land elevation is the primary factor that determines the vulnerability of coastal areas to inundation. This project builds on previous work in which a 1-meter resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was developed for Majuro Atoll, home to the capital and largest city in the Marshall Islands. Researchers will use this DEM to map areas of Majuro Atoll that are vulnerable to inundation, based on different water level scenarios. For example, these maps can be used to answer the question of which areas would flood should seas rise by 0.4, 0.8, or 1 meter, and will represent the first detailed assessment of sea-level rise vulnerability for Majuro.  The results of this project will support assessments of how future inundation events could impact ecosystems, infrastructure, the freshwater supply, and agroforestry on Majuro Atoll. This much-needed information will provide government authorities and local community groups with an improved understanding of the types of actions needed to prepare for future inundation and an estimated timeline for when these actions would best be implemented."}, {"node": 1, "name": "Near-term Climate Projections to Inform Adaptation in the Hawaiian Islands", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2017", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59ef93fae4b0220bbd991181", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "Land, water, and natural resource managers and planners across Hawai\u2019i are tasked with making important decisions about the state\u2019s future.

In Hawai\u02bbi, efforts to conserve native forests have come into conflict with objectives to sustain non-native game mammals, such as feral pigs, goats, and deer, for subsistence and sport hunting. Maintaining stable or increasing game populations represents one of the greatest obstacles to the recovery of Hawaii\u2019s 425 threatened and endangered plant species. Many endemic Hawaiian species have declined and become endangered as a result of herbivorous non-native game mammals. Meanwhile, other environmental changes, including the spread of invasive grasses and changing precipitation patterns and wildfire regimes could further interact to alter the distribution and range of native plants.   This project will address the need to optimally balance long-term endangered plant recovery with non-native game management. Focusing on the islands of Maui and L\u0101na\u02bfi, researchers will map the distribution of game species and native plant species, then use these maps to identify zones that would be optimal for plant conservation, and others for game management. This analysis will take into account both the current distribution and potential future distribution of game and plant species, as climate conditions change. The results of this project will support both federal and state land managers in Hawai\u02bfi.

As a result, predictions of future inundation often underestimate the timing and magnitude of future flooding, because they are only considering one part of the picture.    The National Park Service (NPS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) need accurate projections of inundation and flooding in order to develop effective adaptation plans that can help avoid or reduce the loss of invaluable natural and cultural resources and costly damage to critical infrastructure in the USAPI. To address this need, researchers will model future coastal flooding based on different plausible scenarios of storm- and sea-level rise-induced flooding in Hawai\u02bbi and the USAPI. This effort will result in high-resolution (~10 m2) maps of potential future inundation at national parks in Hawai\u02bbi, Guam, Saipan, and American Samoa and national wildlife refuges on the islands of Maui, O\u02bbahu, Kaua\u02bbi, Moloka\u02bbi, and Guam. Researchers will also assess what the different inundation scenarios could mean for natural and biological resources on these islands. The results will help to reduce the risk and increase the resiliency of NPS and USFWS lands on low-lying islands and provide sound scientific guidance for current and future NPS and USFWS management decisions."}, {"node": 14, "name": "The Future Resiliency of Mangrove Forests to Sea-Level Rise in the Western Pacific: Initiating a National Assessment Approach", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2019", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d5ef403e4b01d82ce97cd1e", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "Sea-level rise will eventually flood and kill many coastal mangrove trees. The loss of mangrove forests will strongly affect human populations on isolated western Pacific islands as they rely heavily on mangroves for food, such as fish, shrimp, and crabs; building materials; and fire wood. Mangroves also shelter coastal communities from the impacts of tsunamis and cyclones, are home to endangered species such as the Yapese monarch and flying fox, and remove and store CO2 from the atmosphere. In the past, mangroves have adjusted to sea-level rise through tree root growth and the accumulation of sediments from rivers and oceans, processes which allow them to maintain their forest floor elevation relative to sea level. However, in light of the projected acceleration of the rate of sea-level rise, as well as modifications made to coastal environments that impede their ability to respond, it is unclear how mangrove forests will respond to future conditions.   Identifying which mangrove forests are most affected by sea-level rise allows us to determine how to protect them today so that they can continue to support humans and wildlife tomorrow. Mangroves in the western Pacific contain some of the most pristine and productive ecosystems in the world, but very little data is available in this region to predict mangrove vulnerability or resilience. This project is building on an existing mangrove monitoring network created by the U.S. Forest Service, the USGS, and the Micronesia Conservation Trust in the Federated States of Micronesia to assess the vulnerability of mangrove forests to sea-level rise to inform management planning. Focusing on the islands of Kosrae and Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia, researchers will identify which mangroves are keeping up with sea-level rise and which are not, and then model potential changes in the ecosystems that could occur.   This information will then be shared with state management agencies and local conservation organizations on both islands, including the Conservation Society of Pohnpei and the Kosrae Island Resource Management Authority, so that managers can identify what can be done to increase the ability of mangroves to keep up with sea-level rise. For example, moving roads or bridges so that mangroves can migrate inland or restoring connections to streams so that sediments can be deposited onto the mangrove forest floor could both support mangrove resiliency. Meanwhile, mangroves that are building elevation and adapting to sea-level rise should be protected from deforestation and maintained in that state for as long as possible. Increasing or protecting the ability of mangroves to keep up with sea-level rise will mean that these ecosystems can continue their role of supporting subsistence economies and diverse ecological communities in the Pacific Islands.

For example, 61% of native flowering Hawaiian plant species are either bird pollinated or dispersed through ingestion by birds. However, native bird communities across Hawai\u02bbi continue to decline despite efforts to control predators and enhance habitat. These declines are, in part, due to the mosquito-borne avian pox and avian malaria.  Scientific forecasts of the impact of avian disease on native bird populations under various climate change scenarios predict severe declines and species extinctions in all remaining forest habitat within the next 50 years. While little can currently be done to mitigate the effects of climate change on disease vectors, recent innovations in mosquito suppression and eradication may provide new tools to control or eliminate disease vectors from forest bird habitat. State and federal biologists across Hawai\u02bbi have made mosquito control a conservation priority and are currently focusing on developing the Wolbachia-based Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) to suppress mosquito populations. This technique involves using naturally-occurring strains of the bacteria Wolbachia to cause mosquito incompatibility (where mosquito sperm and eggs are unable to form viable offspring) and infertility. Sustained releases of male mosquitoes infected with incompatible Wolbachia can help to suppress wild mosquito populations.  To meet regulatory approval for the use of Wolbachia and achieve successful suppression of mosquitos, key ecological parameters (population density, dispersal, and survivorship of the mosquitos) need to first be assessed. These parameters help to inform the number of Wolbachia-infected mosquitos to release as well as the location and timing of their release. This project will use Mark-release-recapture (MRR) techniques to gather information about mosquito populations in selected areas in Hawai\u2019i. The MRR process includes capturing, marking, and releasing a portion of the population, and then later, capturing another portion and counting the number of marked individuals within the sample. This sampling will both improve the ability to detect and monitor mosquito populations and inform the use of IIT in the future for suppressing mosquitos. Results from this project will be directly useful to the conservation efforts of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office, and other resource management groups in Hawai\u02bbi."}, {"node": 16, "name": "Understanding Sediment Transport to Coastal Waters and Coral Reefs in West Maui", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2015", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/559eb2e7e4b0b94a64018fd9", "num_items": 2, "items": {"5914ac9ce4b0e541a03e9ad5": {"title": "Final Project Report: Mapping and environmental science to support clean reefs of West Maui, Hawaii", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5914ac9ce4b0e541a03e9ad5"}, "58213484e4b08f3b91767f13": {"title": "Data for Mapping and Environmental Science to Support Clean Reefs of West Maui, Hawai'i", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58213484e4b08f3b91767f13"}}, "summary": "Coral ecosystems of West Maui support a vibrant tourism industry and provide tangible economic benefits to the community. Hawaiian nearshore reefs generate about $800 million in annual revenue, not including the ecosystem services they provide - such as critical habitat for diverse fish species and buffering coasts from storm surges. The Hawaiian economy depends on healthy coral ecosystems, yet reefs are currently facing multiple threats, including changing climate conditions, local land-based pollution, and sediment erosion.  Erosion of soils into nearshore coastal zones is a chief concern facing land managers in West Maui. Intermittent rainfall can carry sediment from sources such as dirt roads, agricultural fields, streambanks, and disturbed forests into estuaries and the ocean. These sediments can block light that corals need for photosynthesis, essentially smothering them. Sediment also affects coastal user enjoyment by reducing water quality.  The goal of this project was to map, monitor, and analyze recent and historic rainfall to estimate sources of sediment for watersheds in West Maui. Researchers described how much sediment was entering the water from different land-based sources, to create a sediment budget for two watersheds in West Maui. Researchers found that current sediment deposition into coastal waters is likely due to the erosion of streambank terraces located downstream of former agricultural fields. These terraces are remnants of old agricultural land management practices in which soil and rock waste were pushed from fields into streams. It\u2019s estimated that this source results in over 90 dump truck loads of fine sediment entering West Maui\u2019s nearshore environment each year.  The information gathered from this project has already been used to inform a tool for estimating streambank erosion and sediment runoff into coastal zones during rainfall events. This tool can help resource managers and planners assess how different management options could help reduce the amount of sediment entering coastal waters."}, {"node": 17, "name": "Building Capacity for Coordination of Strategic Science Research in the  US-Affiliated Pacific Islands", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2015", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589a36bfe4b0efcedb71a61c", "num_items": 2, "items": {"589b5ee6e4b0efcedb72d31d": {"title": "An Inventory of Climate Change Projects in select United States Affiliated Pacific Islands (Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589b5ee6e4b0efcedb72d31d"}, "589b6384e4b0efcedb72d33d": {"title": "Preliminary Geospatial Data and Training Needs Assessment to Increase USAPI Capacity", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589b6384e4b0efcedb72d33d"}}, "summary": "Small Pacific islands are especially vulnerable to climate change.

These include climate change, climate variability, and drought (referred to collectively as CCVD). Climate variability describes how the climate fluctuates on a yearly basis around average values, while climate change describes patterns of long-term continuous change in the average.   While it is understood that CCVD will exert a growing influence on Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s ecosystems and communities, there is currently little information on the historic impacts of CCVD in the region.

The Hawai\u02bbi Department of Land and Natural Resources, local planning departments, and other coastal management agencies are using this project\u2019s data and maps for hazard preparedness and adaptation planning on state and local scales. Results were incorporated into a statewide study of shoreline sea-level rise vulnerability led by the Hawai\u02bbi State Interagency Climate Adaptation Committee. While this study focused on Kaua\u02bbi, it established a methodology for predicting future beach erosion that is now being applied to other areas of the state to improve coastal management decision making.

The Marshallese have a long tradition of interplanting food-producing trees such as coconuts, breadfruit, and pandanus with bananas and root and vegetable crops. Locally grown food crops support community self-sufficiency, promote good nutrition, and can also serve as windbreaks and stabilize shorelines to lessen storm damage and erosion. However, climate change is posing serious challenges for growers, as they struggle to adapt to climate impacts including saltwater intrusion, changing precipitation and temperature patterns, and the spread of invasive species.  The goal of this project was to provide Marshallese agricultural producers with information and resources that will help them adapt their growing practices to changing climate conditions. Researchers are creating a living website that provides clear, actionable farming information displayed in a dashboard format. Users can find information in English and Marshallese about seasonal rainfall, winds, and sea level as well as agricultural calendars based on El Ni\u00f1o/ La Ni\u00f1a. The website also provides facts on traditional growing practices and timings, crop tolerances, and nutrition. Pages can be downloaded, printed, and distributed by local agricultural extension services.  This project was implemented by Marshallese partners at the Ministry of Resources and Development, College of the Marshall Islands, and Land Grant program, and external partners from the University of Hawai\u02bbi, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service.

It is important to be able to predict how Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s streams will be affected by changing rainfall patterns to enable sustainable management of critical freshwater resources. However, to date, limited data and the uncertain effects of climate change have hindered predictions of future streamflow.  Through this project, scientists developed a model that provides a way to estimate future stream low flow (streamflow during a period of prolonged dryness) by categorizing streams based on their physical characteristics. While the model is based on data from gaged streams (i.e., those fitted with measuring devices to monitor streamflow), it allows researchers to also predict streamflow at ungaged (unmonitored) sites and thus develop island- or state-wide predictions of stream response to future rainfall conditions.  Researchers used the model to forecast flow changes in Maui streams under two possible end-of-century future climate scenarios. Results indicate that in areas where rainfall is projected to decrease in the future, stream low flow may decrease by more than 50 percent in some areas, and habitat for native species may decrease by more than 25 percent in some streams. The methods developed for this study can be transferred to other Pacific islands as well as non-island settings.

In many parts of the world, this decrease in temperature is a limiting factor for vegetation\u2014at certain elevations, the temperature becomes too cold for plants to survive. However in the tropics, moisture availability may play a more important role than temperature in determining the altitude at which forests can grow. For example on Haleakal\u0101, a volcano on the Hawaiian Island of Mau\u02bbi, the forest line is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. Rather, the forest line is highest in the wetter eastern-most end and lower on the drier, western end of the volcano.   Research also suggests that short-duration extreme climate events that cause changes in moisture, such as El Ni\u00f1o, can control the upper limit of forests more than long-term average climate does. This is because species found at the forest line are often already near their physiological limits, so extreme changes can have a big effect on their survival.    A strong El Ni\u00f1o occurred in Hawai\u02bbi in 2015 and provided researchers with a unique opportunity to observe how vegetation responds to ensuing climate variability. Researchers are focusing on Metrosideros polymorpha, a species of flowering evergreen native to Hawai\u02bbi. This species is the dominant canopy tree found near the forest line and will be used as an indicator for how the forest line responds to El Ni\u00f1o-driven drought. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to: (1) Observe the climate and ecosystem processes at locations near and above the forest line on Haleakal\u0101 during an El Ni\u00f1o event. (2) Determine how the ecosystem responds to changes in climate, such as drought, caused by El Ni\u00f1o. (3) Determine whether plant responses to short-term changes in climate and drought vary along the cross-slope rainfall gradient.

Already, high elevation areas have experienced rapidly increasing temperatures and there has been an increase in the frequency of drought across the Islands. These climatic changes could have significant impacts on Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s plants and animals. Changes in temperature and moisture may make current habitat no longer suitable for some species, and could allow invasive species to spread into new areas.   Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park is home to 23 species of endangered vascular plants and 15 species of endangered trees. Understanding how climate change may impact the park\u2019s plants is vital for their long-term survival. This project was designed to assist managers of Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park in preparing for a changing climate by identifying how plant distributions within the park may shift under future climate conditions. Researchers focused on the park\u2019s Special Ecological Areas \u2013 sites of critical importance roughly configured to protect representative plant communities and important species by controlling the most invasive incipient plants and animals. Researchers aimed to identify how plants may migrate to new locations and contract from current locations as species distributions respond to habitat suitability under future climate conditions, and map future plant species ranges. This information will then be used resource managers to determine whether the boundaries of the Special Ecological Areas need to be adjusted to account for future shifts in plant ranges.   Information on how climate change may alter plant distributions, including those of endangered and culturally-significant species, is required for effective management of the park\u2019s ecosystems into the future. The results of this project can help park managers overcome one of the greatest hurdles facing resource managers today \u2013 developing climate adaptation strategies in the face of an uncertain future."}, {"node": 30, "name": "Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2012", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/50118f9fe4b0d78fd4e59ba6", "num_items": 5, "items": {"57ec5fbce4b090825010b908": {"title": "Predicted climate and avian malaria risk to Hawaiian honeycreepers on the Island of Hawaii from 2098-2100", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57ec5fbce4b090825010b908"}, "563a3bd1e4b0d6133fe733c5": {"title": "Will a warmer and wetter future cause extinction of native Hawaiian forest birds?", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/563a3bd1e4b0d6133fe733c5"}, "5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025": {"title": "Final Project Report for \"Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation\"", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025"}, "5894fdaae4b0fa1e59b86a32": {"title": "Project Snapshot: Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5894fdaae4b0fa1e59b86a32"}, "5877a9d9e4b0315b4c120031": {"title": "Mitigating Future Avian Malaria Threats to Hawaiian Forest Birds from Climate Change", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5877a9d9e4b0315b4c120031"}}, "summary": " The Hawaiian Islands are home to some of the world\u2019s most culturally valuable but imperiled forest birds, including brightly colored native honeycreepers, many of which are threatened or endangered. One of the major threats these birds face is avian malaria, which is spread by a species of introduced mosquito and can have death rates exceeding 90 percent. For decades, upper mountain forests have provided refuge for Hawaiian forest birds because mosquitoes (and thus the disease) could not survive the cooler temperatures. However, warming associated with climate change could change this. Scientists used climate data and an epidemiological model to evaluate the future impacts of avian malaria on Hawaiian forest birds as a result of climate change. Results show that over the current century, anticipated changes in temperature and rainfall will favor increased mosquito populations and their expansion into high-elevation forests. These findings suggest that without significant intervention and mosquito control measures, many native Hawaiian honeycreepers will suffer major population declines and/or extinction due to increasing risk from avian malaria.

However, to date, available global climate models have been too coarse in resolution to be useful for planning in the context of small, isolated islands.  This project produced the first-ever set of high-resolution climate projections for Guam and American Samoa, providing information on key variables of interest to decision makers such as rainfall, air temperature, and tropical cyclone patterns. Modeling results suggest that both territories are expected to become warmer and experience a higher number of extreme rainfall events through the current century. In addition, American Samoa is projected to become wetter overall, with a mean rainfall increase of up to 25 percent by the late 21st century, and Guam may be subject to a higher frequency of strong tropical cyclones. These data are intended for use by other researchers to inform hydrological and ecosystem models and, ultimately, aid local decision makers as they plan for climate change impacts and seek to reduce risk through effective adaptation.

The plant was once considered a conservation success, when active management led to a population recovery in the early 20th century. Unfortunately, silversword populations are now declining, and climate change \u2013 namely decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures \u2013 is thought to be responsible.   The goal of this project was to collect data on both silverswords and climate conditions to pinpoint the exact cause of silversword declines and to predict how the species will fare under potential future climate scenarios. Researchers aimed to identify management strategies that might help restore silversword populations. So far, results have shown that silversword populations have declined by about 60% since 1990, and that this decline coincides with lower rainfall.   The prominence of the silversword within the Hawaiian alpine ecosystem renders it one of the more visible examples of climate change-induced biodiversity loss. Identifying the specific climatic variables that are contributing to the silversword population decline will help Park managers determine which management actions will be necessary to protect this iconic species into the future.

The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) spreads over 29 atolls and has a population of over 50,000 people with homes and communities that may be threatened by these climate change-related events.  Policy makers, planners, and others within RMI are faced with decisions about how to prepare for the future and need scientific data and information about the vulnerability of Pacific Islands to potential climate change impacts like sea-level rise. Topographic and bathymetric data are needed to map out the overland and underwater formations that comprise RMI.  These maps can then be used to calculate and visualize potential effects and damage from wave inundation and other coastal hazards.  To help address this need, the Pacific Islands Climate Science Center is collaborating with the USGS Coastal National Elevation Database (CoNED) program to collect topographic and bathymetric data and develop a Digital Elevation Model (a 3D representation of the terrain) for the southern half of Majuro Atoll (home to the capital city and largest population of RMI) that can be used to visualize and project climate change impacts.

Sea level rise threatens the very existence of RMI as high-end projections of sea level rise by the end of the century exceed the average elevation of these low atoll reef islands. Already, waves wash over Majuro during \u201cking tides\u201d when strong winds blow from the west across the broad lagoon, or when there are high open ocean waves. Flooding waves breach island shores in multiple locations and wash into homes, cemeteries, across roads, and into commercial districts. Over the past decade, there has been a widespread exodus of residents to locations in Hawai\u02bbi and the continental U.S. as life becomes increasingly untenable on these low sand and gravel islands.  In order for Majuro and RMI leaders and decision makers to plan and implement a strategy for moving forward, scientific information and geospatial data are needed to model the timing and spatial pattern of future flooding in the first and most vulnerable areas. This project team will use a digital elevation model (DEM), currently under development, for the Majuro Atoll to model sea level rise and develop flooding simulations to help identify vulnerable areas. The team will also collect topographic and bathymetric data on Majuro to extend the areas covered by the DEM to provide a more comprehensive view of future wave flooding associated with sea level rise.  In later years of the project, the team plans to utilize existing data on groundwater and collect new information on Majuro\u2019s water table to model and understand water table dynamics in order to simulate inundation of saltwater into groundwater due to sea level rise. A primary goal of this project is to distribute project deliverables and provide training in their interpretation and application to Marshallese government agencies to inform mitigation and adaptation.

Persistent drought is further affecting agricultural production in the RMI. Many Marshallese communities are already experiencing these changes and are migrating to larger islands within the RMI and to other countries like the U.S. to, among other things, seek alternative means of making a living and access healthcare.  The number of Marshallese residing in the U.S. has rapidly risen over the past two decades, from 7,000 in 2000 to 22,000 in 2010. There is also substantial internal migration, mainly from outer islands to the main atoll of Majuro. However, we do not know to what extent Marshallese people are already migrating because of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services\u2014nor do we know whether this migration can be regarded as a successful adaptation strategy. The factors triggering human migration are complex and often intertwined, making it difficult to pinpoint and address specific causes from a public policy perspective. For example, changes in ecosystems due to climate change can cause health problems or food insecurity, which may have greater consequences in communities with political, social, or economic tension.  Decision makers at local and state levels in both the RMI and U.S.\u2014for example those who design policy related to immigrant access to services\u2014need information to better understand the factors contributing to current migration and to anticipate possible future impacts of climate on human migration. Also, a better understanding is needed of how migration impacts livelihoods and well being in the island to which migrants arrive and in the areas in which they settle.  This research project will study the nature of Marshallese migration and its effects on migrants, themselves, and communities in source and destination areas. There are three central research questions:    \tTo what extent are climatic stressors, and their impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods and habitability, already driving migration in RMI? \tWhat are the impacts of migration in source and destinations areas? \tHow do migration reasons and consequences vary among different types of respondents?  This project will examine the extent to which we can identify direct and indirect links between patterns of human migration and climate events. As a next step, the projects\u2019 research findings on migration decision-making could be integrated into agent-based models that use projections of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services to understand which islands and communities are at highest risk and from where we can expect most migration to take place in the future.

Once it reaches the ground, rain can either run off and contribute to water flow in streams, or it can infiltrate into the ground and provide water for plants and recharge aquifers and groundwater. The exact route that water takes is controlled by many factors, including the duration and intensity of rainfall, the topography of the land, soil properties, and vegetation.   The introduction and spread of invasive plants and animals in Hawaiian forests, which alters the water-use and soil characteristics of ecosystems, can have large impacts on downstream water users. Increased demand and competition for limited water resources in Hawai\u02bbi has underscored the need for a better understanding of this relationship; however, relevant statewide data is currently lacking.   The objective of this project is to understand how expanding invasive plant populations and changing rainfall patterns will impact water resources in the future. Project researchers are exploring the differences in key soil characteristics that control runoff and groundwater recharge in managed and relatively intact native mesic (moderate amounts of water) and wet forests and in similar invasive-dominated forests. Primary soil characteristics of interest are the hydraulic conductivity of soils (ability of water to move through soils) and soil hydrophobicity (a property that causes water to collect on the surface rather than infiltrating into the ground). Data will also be collected on the canopy and understory composition in the forests and on disturbances by invasive animals, like feral pigs. Results from the study will be presented in reports and maps of vegetation and soil characteristics across the Hawaiian Islands under current and future conditions.

The results from this study will inform resource managers of the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and the importance of fog drip in mitigating the impacts of drought. This study will also provide needed input for supporting science-based strategies for managing critical groundwater recharge areas and identifying areas vulnerable to wildfires. The results will be a great value to forest and water-resource managers, watershed partnerships striving to protect, preserve, and restore large areas of forested watersheds for water-resource and conservation values, and outreach agents seeking to reduce the threat of wildfire to ecosystems and communities by facilitating the sharing of fire knowledge.

There is ample literature on the effects of long-term climate change and short-term climate variability on the occurrence of droughts. However, it is unclear whether this information meets the needs of relevant stakeholders and actually contributes to reducing the vulnerability or increasing the resilience of communities to droughts. For example, are the methods used to characterize the severity of drought \u2013 known as drought indices \u2013 effective tools for predicting the actual damage felt by communities?   As droughts continue to increase in frequency and severity, the need to understand community vulnerability and resilience to drought is only growing. Focusing on New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, this study sought to answer several key questions. First, researchers examined whether existing drought indices are effective in predicting the occurrence of drought events and their actual damages. Second, researchers explored why some communities suffer less damage from drought and recover faster than others. Finally, researchers identified strategies for encouraging the adoption of water conservation behaviors among residents. So far, results show that drought indices are overall useful tools for predicting drought damage and that a community\u2019s resilience to drought is often tied to socioeconomic conditions.   This research was conducted in partnership with two Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. In addition to gaining the scientific knowledge of the linkages between drought indices, damages, and community resilience, this research (1) developed tools to measure drought resilience, (2) identified key indicators of resilience, (3) identified the gaps between drought indices and actual damages, and (4) identified the factors that influence residents\u2019 decisions to adopt adaptive measures.

Severe drought coupled with human development have profoundly impacted the quantity and quality of water in the basin. Running through Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico, the Rio Grande is a multi-national resource that is managed by many different state, federal, and local authorities and used by diverse stakeholders. Developing the basin-wide responses necessary for drought resilience throughout the Basin can be challenging in such a complex management context.  This project seeks to understand how different human and environmental factors affect ten sections of the Rio Grande in order to identify how management strategies and human uses of the river can be better coordinated. The end product will be a tool allowing stakeholders to examine the costs and benefits of their decisions for themselves and for upstream and downstream users. Overall, the results of this research will help stakeholders improve future drought resilience and facilitate the sustainable use of water resources throughout the Basin.

The multi-national, multi-state, ecologically diverse nature of this river makes management of the resource a complex task, especially in the context of more frequent droughts, changes in land use patterns, and increasing water use needs.  The purpose of this project was to review scientific monitoring and research reports and provide an overview of the state of the knowledge of the Upper Rio Grande-Rio Bravo Basin. The project researchers developed a report that synthesizes historical and geomorphic studies that describe the river\u2019s characteristics in the 1800s, its subsequent transformation caused by consumptive water use, dams, and physical manipulation of the channel, and a modern understanding of the natural and transformed flow regime. An extensive second section of the report focuses on aquatic ecology of the four major river segments of the Basin. In that section, the researchers summarize current understanding of the historical state compared to the contemporary state of the ecosystem, identify causes of ecosystem degradation, with an emphasis on those factors most affected by flow, and identify existing efforts to reverse ecosystem degradation, however intractable and dynamic these efforts may be.

Also, because the future is uncertain, the project researchers will integrate multiple future climate conditions to project a range of likely future hydrologic conditions. The team will use stakeholder meetings and an interactive web page to disseminate results and provide water managers with useable information about the magnitude, uncertainty, and implications of hydrologic response to climate change in the future."}, {"node": 59, "name": "Assessing Climate Variability and Adaptation Strategies for the Rio Grande Basin", "casc": "South Central CASC", "fy": "2018", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b5a35cee4b0610d7f4dcd42", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "The Rio Grande is naturally a water-scarce basin in which droughts have been classified as severe (with almost no rain during some years) and extended (lasting more than 10, or even 15 years). Severe and persistent droughts in the Rio Grande basin reduce water availability, which triggers economic, environmental, and social impacts, and effects compliance with interstate compacts and international treaty commitments. In contrast, the Rio Grande basin is also affected by flood events that cause major losses to lives, properties, and economies.  Understanding each of these periods of water scarcity and water abundance can help water managers to design adaptation strategies that cope with these two extremes while still supporting human and environmental water management needs.  The overall goal of this project is to assess the climate variability of the southern branch of the Rio Grande basin and characterize the periods of historical drought and water abundance for 110 years [1900 \u2013 2010]. Results will help to understand extreme climatic events in the past to inform predictions of near future conditions of drought and floods. This study will also explore adaptation strategies relevant for agriculture, urban and rural communities, water management agencies, and environmental restoration to cope with extreme events.  This study addresses two chronic problems (droughts and floods) that have affected water users in the basin for the last 150 years and will continue to affect them in the future. Products from this research include documentation and brochures that explain possible adaptation strategies to cope with extreme climatic events and short videos for public outreach and education for communities and organizations in the Rio Grande basin."}, {"node": 60, "name": "Building a Decision-Support Tool for Assessing the Impacts of Climate and Land Use  Change on Ecological Processes", "casc": "South Central CASC", "fy": "2016", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/580faee6e4b0f497e7960104", "num_items": 2, "items": {"5da0c248e4b0366162961e2a": {"title": "Remote Sensing as the Foundation for High-Resolution United States Landscape Projections \u2013 The Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) Initiative", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5da0c248e4b0366162961e2a"}, "5c75bdc1e4b0fe48cb4a654d": {"title": "Linking Landscapes and People\u2014 Projecting the Future of the Great Plains", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c75bdc1e4b0fe48cb4a654d"}}, "summary": "Scientists, planners, policy makers and other decision-makers in the South Central U.S. want to understand the potential impacts of changes in climate, precipitation, and land-use patterns on natural and cultural resources. Though the potential impacts of climate change can be modeled to help decision-makers plan for future conditions, these models rarely incorporate changes in land-use that may occur. Climate change and land-use change are often linked, as shifts in precipitation and temperature can alter patterns in human land-use activities, such as agriculture.  This project sought to address this gap by developing new software tools that enable stakeholders to quickly develop custom, climate-sensitive land-use projections to satisfy a range of application needs. Stakeholders from across the region participated in the development of the model through two workshops, designed to first gather stakeholder needs and then to apply and evaluate the model to ensure that it maximizes potential use across all stakeholder groups.  Users of the end-product will be able to build customized, scenario-based projections of landscape change, including landscape response to climate change, such as wildfires or altered vegetation patterns. The projections generated with these tools will enable decision-makers and land-use planners to visualize potential future landscapes, optimize land management practices, and adapt to negative impacts of climate and land-use change on ecological and economic systems.

More than half of the Rio Grande\u2019s streamflow originates as snowmelt in Colorado\u2019s mountains, meaning that changes in the amount of snowmelt can impact the water supply for communities along the entire river. Snowmelt runoff is therefore an important component of water supply outlooks for the region, which are used by a variety of stakeholders to anticipate water availability in the springtime.   It is critical that these water supply outlooks be as accurate as possible. Errors can cost states millions of dollars due to mis-allocation of water and lost agricultural productivity. There is a perception that runoff forecast accuracy has declined over the last several decades in Colorado and New Mexico, making water supply outlooks less reliable. Declines in accuracy could be related to changes in climate and land cover; however, potential sources of error have not yet been examined in the upper Rio Grande basin.   This study aims to improve runoff forecast models for the upper Rio Grande. Researchers will identify potential sources of error in existing models, improve the representation of snowpack in models of the watershed, develop a new hydrologic model for the basin, and test this model\u2019s ability to forecast runoff. The end product of this study will be a tool for making improved runoff forecasts for the upper Rio Grande basin. The tool will be transferable to other snowmelt-dominated basins in the region that have similar characteristics. These improved runoff forecasts, in turn, can be used to develop more accurate water supply outlooks in the region, empowering stakeholders in the basin to plan their water use more effectively.

The quantity of water flowing into the northern section of the river depends on how much snowpack from the Rocky Mountains melts into runoff and on seasonal precipitation rates. Models describing the relationship between winter snowpack quantity and springtime snowmelt runoff quantities for the basin are combined with models describing long-term natural variation in precipitation to create water supply outlooks. The outlooks developed by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service are currently used by stakeholders to make critical water allocation decisions in the basin. Improvements to water supply outlooks could be worth millions of dollars associated with better water allocation strategies.   In order to ensure that these outlooks are as accurate as possible for water management planning, there is a need to better understand how snowpack and snowmelt runoff are related to each other and how both may be influenced by large climatic variation such as El Ni\u00f1o and global climate change. To address this need, this project will combine historical data and climate model projections to develop enhanced prediction models relating winter snowpack to subsequent snowmelt runoff in the upper Rio Grande.   The results of this research will identify changes to streamflow predictability over the past several decades (a period of rapid observed warming), and assess future predictability. This work will also help to inform the development of more reliable water supply outlooks essential for planning purposes in the Rio Grande Basin, such as reservoir management and irrigated agriculture.

No standard approach to downscaling currently exists, however, and the process often results in climate projections that suggest a wide array of possible futures. It is critical that decision-makers looking to incorporate climate information understand the uncertainties associated with different downscaling approaches and can evaluate downscaled data to determine which datasets are appropriate for addressing their questions.  The goal of this project is to provide decision-makers with this information by evaluating the uncertainties associated with different downscaled datasets. Materials will then be developed to communicate these uncertainties to managers and explore how they can be incorporated into risk decision-making.

These results suggest that climate variability may have implications for soil health and microbial content. In the South Central U.S., a more developed understanding of how management practices, climate variability, and soil health interact is essential for sound agricultural decision-making.  This project implemented demonstration fields in which various sustainable management practices can be tested and their impacts on soil temperature and health can be monitored. The demonstration fields focused on cotton production and will test management practices related to water use efficiency, carbon storage, and soil health. In addition to demonstrating the effects of various management practices, these plots were designed to determine how much variability cotton production systems can tolerate before ecosystems and the services they provide are negatively affected.  This demonstration system is in high demand amongst regional stakeholders and was implemented with the support of the South\u2010Central USDA Climate Hub, NRCS scientists, and Cotton Inc. It was expected to contribute substantially to our collective understanding of the interactions between climate variability, soil health, and agricultural productivity in the Southern High Plains while equipping stakeholders with the knowledge they need to make appropriate management decisions for optimal agroecosystem health.

Therefore, connectivity, or the ability of organisms to move among habitat patches, is a critical component of landscape health. In addition to influencing the sustainability of wildlife populations and communities, connectivity also contributes to the availability of ecosystem services. The goal of this project was to evaluate terrestrial connectivity across the South Central United States, with a focus on the impact of projected climate and land use changes.  The researchers addressed this goal using a variety of approaches, including evaluating connectivity of major habitat types (grasslands and forests), predicting future changes in landscape connectivity for grassland species, assessing terrestrial vertebrate diversity in relation to habitat loss and fragmentation, and analyzing the combined effects of climate and habitat fragmentation on the distributions of grassland bird species.  They found that connectivity has declined for species with a low to moderate ability to move across the landscape, and that this pattern is expected to continue under future scenarios of land-use change. For grassland birds, the contribution of climate, landscape variables, and their combined effects varied among species, but their combined effects can exceed the independent effects of the two drivers for some species. Thus, the importance of connectivity is expected to increase with the negative implications of climate change for wildlife populations and communities. These results, which are expressed in maps, can be used to inform management decisions and identify future research needs related to terrestrial connectivity within this region.

Water moving through these aquifers carves out magnificent caves, sinkholes, and other formations. These formations are home to high concentrations of rare and endangered species, but the hydrological conditions that support these species can change rapidly. Managing these ecosystems into the future requires a better understanding of how climate, hydrology, and karst ecosystems interact.  The objective of this project was to determine how species and ecosystems associated with karst might respond to future temperature and precipitation extremes and accompanying changes in groundwater levels and springflow. The research focused on 16 species in the Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas and eight species in the Madison aquifer in western South Dakota. Researchers linked global climate models, regional climate models, and hydrologic models to determine how future springflow might be impacted by changes in temperature and precipitation. By combining information about future hydrology with what we know about species needs, researchers determined the vulnerability of the selected species to climate extremes.  Researchers found that more species in the Edwards aquifer are vulnerable to climate extremes than in the Madison aquifer, due in part to the more severe hydrologic changes that the Edwards aquifer is expected to undergo. This result suggests that including hydrologic factors critical to species health is essential in evaluating the vulnerability of karst ecosystems to climate extremes. Natural resource managers can use this information to understand how the character of karst systems are changing and prioritize conservation activities accordingly.

However, the potential effects of sea-level rise is posing new questions about the future availability of SAV for waterfowl and other coastal wildlife. Of primary concern is the fact that rising seas have the potential to increase salinities in fresh and brackish marshes on the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s coast, changing the distribution and composition of SAV communities, and affecting valuable waterfowl habitat and food resources. Not enough is known about the relationship between salinity and SAV to predict how this important food resource will respond to higher salinity levels, creating difficulties for waterfowl conservation planning.   This project identified the relationship between SAV, salinity, and other environmental variables as a first step in understanding how sea-level rise might affect food availability for waterfowl. The study examined coastal marshes of the northern Gulf of Mexico from Mobile Bay, AL, to the Nueces River, TX. Researchers compared SAV distribution and composition across a range of salinity levels, and found that water depth and salinity were the primary factors in determining the amount of SAV resources in a particular marsh. Surprisingly, researchers also found that brackish marsh tended to produce quantities of SAV waterfowl food resources similar to those in fresh marsh environments. The study also found some evidence that saline marshes contain less waterfowl food resources than brackish, intermediate, and fresh marshes.   This work will directly benefit efforts of the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, Gulf Coast Prairies Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC), and Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCC in forecasting the effects of sea-level rise on the distribution, abundance, and diversity of SAV resources and the priority fish and wildlife populations that depend upon them.  This project was co-funded by the South Central Climate Adaptation Science Center and the Gulf Coast Prairie Landscape Conservation Cooperative and Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCC.

Average annual precipitation is less than 10 inches in northwest New Mexico but can exceed 60 inches further east in Louisiana. Much of the region relies on warm-season convective precipitation \u2013 that is, highly localized brief but intense periods of rainfall that are common in the summer. This type of precipitation is a significant driver of climate and ecosystem function in the region, but it is also notoriously difficult to predict since it occurs at such small spatial and temporal scales. While global climate models are helpful for understanding and predicting large-scale precipitation trends, they often do not capture many of the smaller atmospheric and earth surface processes that influence local and regional precipitation trends, like convective precipitation.  To address this gap in climate modeling capabilities, researchers developed regional climate models that are better able to project small-scale precipitation patterns and localized extreme precipitation events. Researchers combined information about land surface and water conditions with weather and climate models in order to quantify the local-scale impacts of climate on water resources. This highly localized information is expected to assist regional decision-makers in addressing the challenge of predicting precipitation in the South Central U.S., leading to a better understanding of potential future impacts on agriculture, fish and wildlife, water quality and availability, and cultural resources.

Black bear, bighorn sheep, mule deer, and wild turkey are just a few of the species found in these isolated mountain ecosystems that rise out of the desert landscape. However, recent droughts have crippled these ecosystems, causing significant tree death. Climate predictions suggest that this region will only face hotter and drier conditions in the future, potentially stressing these ecosystems even further. Simple models predict that vegetation will move to cooler and wetter locations in response to this warming. However, species responses will likely be more complex than these models show, as vegetation navigates other ecological stressors such as elevation change and water availability.  In order to better predict how vegetation will move in response to future warming, a more robust understanding of how drought and temperature impact tree survival is needed. Focusing on three sky island habitats in western Texas, this project sought to identify the key traits influencing current distributions of forest tree species, determine the susceptibility of these species to drought and temperature, and develop fine-scale, localized climate projections that model future conditions for the study area. This information is meant to be used to predict how species might shift location in response to warmer and drier future climates, enabling managers to make more robust decisions that will preserve sky island forests in the face of a changing climate.

However, this approach assumes that models that reliably project past climate conditions will accurately predict future climate conditions, even though the climate system might have changed.    This research contributes to generating more reliable local-scale climate projections by testing the assumption that the climatological relationships which existed in the past will continue to exist in the future. To do this, researchers developed a novel approach in which very high-resolution climate model data were used as a surrogate for historical and future \"observations\", allowing researchers to test how well the more commonly-used coarse-scale global climate models project future climate conditions.  Findings suggest that the assumption holds reasonably well in many cases, but there are some instances (for example in particular geographic locations, such as coastal regions, and at certain times of year, especially summer) when the assumption is not as robust. This research also explores the conditions under which the assumption does not hold, and develops ways to make the methods used to generate local information about climate change more reliable.

In the United States, the ecosystem services provided by wetlands are worth billions of dollars and include flood protection, erosion control, seafood, water quality enhancement, carbon storage, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Unfortunately, these ecosystems are also highly sensitive to changing climate conditions. Past research on climate impacts to coastal wetlands have concentrated primarily on sea-level rise, largely ignoring the important influence of changing temperature and precipitation patterns. Understanding the impact of temperature and precipitation on coastal wetlands can help natural and cultural resource managers account for these factors when making decisions or developing adaptation plans.  This study advances understanding of how temperature and precipitation influence coastal wetland ecosystems. The study models the relationships between wetland plant community structure and climate in the northern Gulf of Mexico and identifies potential impacts of future climate conditions on these ecosystems. The researchers identify critical ecological thresholds and demonstrate that transformative ecological changes due to climatic shifts are probable throughout the Gulf of Mexico within this century. In certain areas, small changes in temperature or rainfall are expected to trigger large ecological changes and affect certain ecosystem services. Because coastal wetland ecosystems in other parts of the world are also sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, the findings of this research have global implications, helping to inform the management of these highly valuable ecosystems under a changing climate.

While urban and agricultural users can cope with frequent droughts by using a combination of river water and pumping groundwater, little to no water reaches living river ecosystems in this region. Improving this situation requires a good understanding of river water and groundwater availability, now and in the future, as well as advantages and disadvantages of water management options to sustain these ecosystems. In particular, there is a need to determine how frequently river water would be available to provide minimum \u201cenvironmental flows\u201d, or the quantity, timing, and quality of water flows needed to support ecosystems and human communities, along the Rio Grande. It is also important to estimate economic gains and losses from using water for ecosystem protection instead of using it for other purposes.   To help provide a scientific basis for understanding these issues, the project researchers will provide scientifically plausible future scenarios of climate and river water and will conduct a systematic assessment of potential impacts to environmental water flows using state-of-the-art hydrologic and economic models. They will assess the impacts of different environmental flow scenarios in terms of changes in Rio Grande flow, crop production, and groundwater sustainability. Furthermore, the project will offer science-based insights about the economic cost of securing water for ecosystems by compensating water rights holders. The results of the project will be shared with water management organizations and interested stakeholders in the Middle Rio Grande Basin for their evaluation, feedback, and use in decision making. The outcomes of the project will inform sustainable water resources management dialogues in the southwestern U.S. and other regions facing similar challenges of providing minimum environmental flows to ecosystems."}, {"node": 85, "name": "Assessing the Impacts of Rapid Rainfall Shifts (\u201cWhiplashes\u201d and \u201cBoomerangs\u201d) on Freshwater Mussels in Central Texas", "casc": "South Central CASC", "fy": "2019", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d40a686e4b01d82ce8d9d83", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "Freshwater mussels are an important component of freshwater ecosystems. They can filter a large amount of water, affecting both water clarity and water chemistry. Their shells provide physical habitat for other organisms, they re-direct necessary nutrients to the bottom of the water column, and their excreted material can enhance the growth of algae and macroinvertebrates. However, dramatic declines of freshwater mussels have occurred due to habitat loss, destruction and modification, pollution, and invasive species. One mussel species in Texas (Texas Hornshell) has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and several other species are candidates for listing.  Changes in precipitation patterns and extremes, such as drought and floods, can also be detrimental to mussels. Freshwater mussels are particularly sensitive to drought events because they are relatively sessile and cannot easily escape to wetter areas. Mussels can also be washed out of suitable habitat during flooding or become stranded in habitat that later dries out. Rapid weather shifts from one extreme to another, such as rainfall \u201cwhiplash\u201d (rapid wet-dry or dry-wet transitions) and \u201cboomerang\u201d (wet-dry-wet or dry-wet-dry transitions) events are therefore particularly harmful to these species.    This project is focused on examining the occurrence of \u201cwhiplash\u201d and \u201cboomerang\u201d events in Central Texas, along the San Saba and Llano River within the Colorado River basin and understanding how these episodes impact freshwater mussels. Through analysis of rainfall and river data and models, and with knowledge of mussel ecology, the project researchers will provide stakeholders with a set of outlooks and information that can be used directly to inform decisions for short-term use and long-term planning during times of large precipitation variability.

Wildfire danger modeling is an important tool for understanding when and where wildfires will occur, and recent work by our team in the South Central United States has shown wildfire danger models may be improved by incorporating soil moisture information. Advancements in wildfire danger modeling may increase wildfire preparedness, and therefore decrease loss of life, property, and habitat due to wildfire. Still, soil moisture\u2014an important determinant of wildfire risk\u2014is not currently used for wildfire danger assessments because data are generally unavailable at the appropriate scales of space and time.  Our project addresses this knowledge gap by developing and disseminating improved wildfire danger assessments that are rooted in high precision estimates of soil moisture. Primary goals are (1) develop an effective model of soil moisture for the Red River and Rio Grande basins using soil maps and climate data; (2) quantify the relationships between modeled soil moisture and wildfire probability; and (3) distribute soil moisture and wildfire probability maps for both basins. Primary outcomes of this work include new web-based tools for exploring soil moisture dynamics in near real-time and relating those dynamics to wildfire probability. We will initiate an aggressive outreach program to ensure our results will have practical applications relevant to a wide range of stakeholders interested in drought, flooding, and fire monitoring and prediction. The intended users of research outcomes include hydrologists, soil scientists, fire planners, land management personnel from universities, state and federal agencies and stakeholder groups including landscape conservation cooperatives and Tribal organizations.

The possibility of climate change has these communities further concerned, primarily because they do not know what to expect. Previously, the USGS, both Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations collaborated on a project to apply a range of possible climate change scenarios to the Red River watershed to determine future water availability.

Mountain forests are a critical part of the hydrologic cycle that feeds these rivers, providing water supply and storage. However wildfire, which is becoming more common as temperatures rise, can disrupt the role of mountain forests in the hydrologic cycle. Uncertainty about the interactions between wildfire and snow-water, and how these interactions may change as climate conditions shift, impedes effective water resource planning in the region.  Until recently, there has been no method available to characterize the potential effects of forest fire on snow-water (water from melted snow) resources. This project will combine two newly developed models that will for the first time allow an accurate analysis of the effects of wildfire on snow-water resources, under current and possible future climate conditions. Researchers will focus on the Las Conchas Fire burn zone in New Mexico\u2019s Jemez Mountains, where approximately 156,000 acres were burned in 2011. However, the framework developed to complete this study will be relevant to forested regions throughout the world where snow-water resources overlap potential burn areas.  The results of this project will improve snow-water forecasting, and therefore water resource planning. For example, the National Weather Service plans on using the results to improve their forecasting capabilities in snowmelt-driven basins that have been impacted by wildfire.

Resource managers face the challenge of apportioning scarce water resources among competing uses, but they lack a systematic framework for comparing the costs and benefits of proposed water management decisions and conservation actions.  In 2016, Co-PIs Neeson and Moreno were funded by the Great Plains LCC to develop a decision support model for identifying the most cost-effective water conservation alternatives across the Red River basin. Here, we propose to extend this optimization model in three significant ways to support cost-effective conservation decisions in the face of climate change and drought. First, we will incorporate SC CSC-developed predictions of rainfall, runoff, and stream flows through the year 2099 into our hydrologic database. Using this database, our enhanced optimization model will enable decision-makers to visualize and evaluate multiple competing water use scenarios under future drought conditions. Second, we will use SC-CSC predictions of stream flows and temperature through the year 2099 to estimate the future distributions of 28 fish species of conservation concern across the Red River. These future distribution maps will enable conservation practitioners to proactively manage species projected to be at greatest risk from declining water availability. Third, we will extend our optimization model to enable decision-makers to explicitly quantify trade-offs between competing water uses and ecological outcomes under multiple use scenarios. In doing so, our optimization model will provide resource managers with a means to identify conservation strategies that maximize outcomes for Great Plains stream ecosystems while meeting growing societal needs for water."}, {"node": 92, "name": "Cultivating a Climate Science Learning Community Amongst Tribal Water Managers", "casc": "South Central CASC", "fy": "2017", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/594aa2f0e4b062508e36f46e", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "In previous climate trainings conducted for tribes and pueblos in Oklahoma and New Mexico, impacts to water resources have emerged as a priority concern.

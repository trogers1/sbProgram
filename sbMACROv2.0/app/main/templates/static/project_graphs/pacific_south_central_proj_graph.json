Climate change will likely alter rainfall timing and intensity, but global climate models cannot capture the fine-scale dynamics of local rainfall, making future rainfall predictions for the islands uncertain.

Results suggest that Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s climate will become drier overall in the second half of the century, but this effect will vary considerably across the islands and by season. There may be an increasing contrast between wet and dry regions on each island, as wet areas become wetter and dry areas become drier.

Once it reaches the ground, rain can either run off and contribute to water flow in streams, or it can infiltrate into the ground and provide water for plants and recharge aquifers and groundwater. The exact route that water takes is controlled by many factors, including the duration and intensity of rainfall, the topography of the land, soil properties, and vegetation.   The introduction and spread of invasive plants and animals in Hawaiian forests, which alters the water-use and soil characteristics of ecosystems, can have large impacts on downstream water users. Increased demand and competition for limited water resources in Hawai\u02bbi has underscored the need for a better understanding of this relationship; however, relevant statewide data is currently lacking.   The objective of this project is to understand how expanding invasive plant populations and changing rainfall patterns will impact water resources in the future. Project researchers are exploring the differences in key soil characteristics that control runoff and groundwater recharge in managed and relatively intact native mesic (moderate amounts of water) and wet forests and in similar invasive-dominated forests. Primary soil characteristics of interest are the hydraulic conductivity of soils (ability of water to move through soils) and soil hydrophobicity (a property that causes water to collect on the surface rather than infiltrating into the ground). Data will also be collected on the canopy and understory composition in the forests and on disturbances by invasive animals, like feral pigs.

In many parts of the world, this decrease in temperature is a limiting factor for vegetation\u2014at certain elevations, the temperature becomes too cold for plants to survive. However in the tropics, moisture availability may play a more important role than temperature in determining the altitude at which forests can grow. For example on Haleakal\u0101, a volcano on the Hawaiian Island of Maui, the forest line is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. Rather, the forest line is highest in the wetter eastern-most end and lower on the drier, western end of the volcano.   Research also suggests that short-duration extreme climate events that cause changes in moisture, such as El Ni\u00f1o, can control the upper limit of forests more than long-term average climate does. This is because species found at the forest line are often already near their physiological limits, so extreme changes can have a big effect on their survival.    A strong El Ni\u00f1o occurred in Hawai\u2019i in 2015 and provided researchers with a unique opportunity to observe how vegetation responds to ensuing climate variability. Researchers are focusing on Metrosideros polymorpha, a species of flowering evergreen native to Hawai\u2019i. This species is the dominant canopy tree found near the forest line and will be used as an indicator for how the forest line responds to El Ni\u00f1o-driven drought.

Researchers will also create the first regional soil moisture database for the South Central US, which will further support drought monitoring and other climate-related research efforts in this drought-prone region. This improved monitoring capability will facilitate early detection and the implementation of adaptive management strategies, which research has shown are key to reducing the economic and ecological impacts of drought.

Researchers at Texas Tech University found that lower daily temperature ranges of soil in the Southern High Plains were associated with higher levels of soil microbes (which help make critical nutrients available for plants) and decreased nitrogen availability. These results suggest that climate variability may have implications for soil health and microbial content. In the South Central U.S., a more developed understanding of how management practices, climate variability, and soil health interact is essential for sound agricultural decision-making.  This project will implement demonstration fields in which various sustainable management practices can be tested and their impacts on soil temperature and health can be monitored. The demonstration fields will focus on cotton production and will test management practices related to water use efficiency, carbon storage, and soil health. In addition to demonstrating the effects of various management practices, these plots will help to determine how much variability cotton production systems can tolerate before ecosystems and the services they provide are negatively affected.  This demonstration system is in high demand amongst regional stakeholders and will be implemented with the support of the South\u2010Central USDA Climate Hub, NRCS scientists, and Cotton Inc.

However wildfire, which is becoming more common as temperatures rise, can disrupt the role of mountain forests in the hydrologic cycle. Uncertainty about the interactions between wildfire and snow-water, and how these interactions may change as climate conditions shift, impedes effective water resource planning in the region.  Until recently, there has been no method available to characterize the potential effects of forest fire on snow-water (water from melted snow) resources.

The researchers addressed this goal using a variety of approaches, including evaluating connectivity of major habitat types (grasslands and forests), predicting future changes in landscape connectivity for grassland species, assessing terrestrial vertebrate diversity in relation to habitat loss and fragmentation, and analyzing the combined effects of climate and habitat fragmentation on the distributions of grassland bird species.  They found that connectivity has declined for species with a low to moderate ability to move across the landscape, and that this pattern is expected to continue under future scenarios of land-use change. For grassland birds, the contribution of climate, landscape variables, and their combined effects varied among species, but their combined effects can exceed the independent effects of the two drivers for some species. Thus, the importance of connectivity is expected to increase with the negative implications of climate change for wildlife populations and communities. These results, which are expressed in maps, can be used to inform management decisions and identify future research needs related to terrestrial connectivity within this region.

However, the potential effects of sea-level rise is posing new questions about the future availability of SAV for waterfowl and other coastal wildlife. Of primary concern is the fact that rising seas have the potential to increase salinities in fresh and brackish marshes on the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s coast, changing the distribution and composition of SAV communities, and affecting valuable waterfowl habitat and food resources. Not enough is known about the relationship between salinity and SAV to predict how this important food resource will respond to higher salinity levels, creating difficulties for waterfowl conservation planning.   This project identified the relationship between SAV, salinity, and other environmental variables as a first step in understanding how sea-level rise might affect food availability for waterfowl. The study examined coastal marshes of the northern Gulf of Mexico from Mobile Bay, AL, to the Nueces River, TX. Researchers compared SAV distribution and composition across a range of salinity levels, and found that water depth and salinity were the primary factors in determining the amount of SAV resources in a particular marsh. Surprisingly, researchers also found that brackish marsh tended to produce quantities of SAV waterfowl food resources similar to those in fresh marsh environments. The study also found some evidence that saline marshes contain less waterfowl food resources than brackish, intermediate, and fresh marshes.   This work will directly benefit efforts of the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, Gulf Coast Prairies Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC), and Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCC in forecasting the effects of sea-level rise on the distribution, abundance, and diversity of SAV resources and the priority fish and wildlife populations that depend upon them.  This project was co-funded by the South Central Climate Adaptation Science Center and the Gulf Coast Prairie Landscape Conservation Cooperative and Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCC.

An estimated 90% of rural households in Southeast Alaska use salmon. Environmental changes that compromise the ability of these streams to support salmon could have dramatic consequences for the region. In particular, there is concern that climate change could undermine the capacity of the region\u2019s streams to support productive fisheries. As a result, regional stakeholders are interested in identifying some of the potential impacts of climate change on watersheds that support abundant salmon. These stakeholders include federal and state agencies (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, Alaska Department of Fish and Game), native corporations (Sealaska), non-profit entities (Southeast Alaska Watershed Coalition, The Nature Conservancy, Trout Unlimited), and numerous local communities that rely on healthy salmon populations.   One of the difficulties in predicting the effects of climate change on stream food webs, however, is the lack of information on the sources and pathways of energy and nutrients that fuel fish production in freshwater habitats. The objective of this study is to quantify trophic linkages and energy flow through the food webs that support salmon production in glacial-, snow-, and rain-fed streams, and in so doing, illuminate the seasonal patterns of energy and nutrient flow that salmon rely on. This is the first study of this extent and focus in Southeast Alaska, where one of the largest fishing industries in the world operates. For Southeast Alaska and beyond, the research will provide a detailed understanding of the freshwater food webs that support productive and resilient fisheries, and how climate change may affect these webs. The work will help managers identify critical food resources for fish by highlighting the important pathways supporting juvenile salmon growth in freshwater. This information will be used in food web models that can inform community adaption and land management in not just Southeast Alaska, but in any region that contains abundant rearing habitat for salmon and where snow and glacier ice melt substantially contribute to streamflow."}, {"node": 1, "name": "The Impacts of Glacier Change on the Jago, Okpilak, and Hulahula Rivers in the Arctic", "casc": "Alaska CASC", "fy": "2011", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5040d7e4e4b07a90c5ec09e5", "num_items": 1, "items": {"560586dbe4b058f706e51439": {"title": "Mapping snow depth from manned aircraft on landscape scales  at centimeter resolution using structure-from-motion photogrammetry", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/560586dbe4b058f706e51439"}}, "summary": " The Jago, Okpilak, and Hulahula rivers in the Arctic are heavily glaciated waterways that are important for fish and wildlife as well as human activities including the provision of food, recreation, and, potentially, resource extraction on the coastal plain. If current glacial melting trends continue, most of the ice in these rivers will disappear in the next 50-100 years. Because of their importance to human and natural communities, it is critical to understand how these rivers and their surrounding environments will be affected by climate change and glacier loss. The overarching goal of this project was to research (1) the amount of river water, sediment, nutrients, and organic matter in the Jago, Okpilak, and Hulahula rivers that come from glacier melt, (2) the effects that glacier melt has on terrestrial, aquatic, and coastal ecosystems, and (3) the changes in river processes that occur as glaciers disappear.  This project was designed to bring a better understanding about how glacier-dominated Arctic rivers differ from un-glaciated rivers and, in turn, sought to improve the ability of resource managers to plan for potential changes in downstream ecosystem responses that may be different from region to region along the Arctic Ocean coast.

The IEM generates maps and other products that illustrate how arctic and boreal landscapes might change in response to other climate change-driven changes in vegetation, hydrology, permafrost (e.g. frozen ground) etc.  The IEM integrates three different models: - the Alaska Frame-Based Ecosystem Code (ALFRESCO), which simulates wildland fire and vegetation establishment and growth; - the Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab model (GIPL), which simulates characteristics of soils, hydrology, vegetation, plant community composition, biomass, and carbon balance in soil; - and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) [which includes the Dynamic Vegetation (DVM) and Dynamic Organic Soil (DOS) models], which simulates permafrost (i.e. frozen ground) dynamics and changes.

Some research suggests crop production for some varieties might advance northward in the state, leading to increases in yields and new varieties becoming viable. However, it\u2019s also projected that water stress may become an increasing challenge facing farmers. Further, some crops, such as the burgeoning peony market, are dependent on Alaska\u2019s cool climate and late summer season, and could be negatively impacted by warming temperatures.   Currently available tools are limited in their ability to help Alaska\u2019s farmers adjust to climate change, because they primarily focus on the effects of extreme winter temperatures. However, additional variables, such as day length, thaw dates, freeze dates, growing season length, and occurrence of extreme heat may all affect whether a particular crop can be grown in a particular location. To better support Alaska\u2019s small-scale growers, researchers will work with local farmers to first identify their immediate and long-term needs in relation to ongoing and potential future climate-related changes to crops. Next, researchers will develop fine-scale maps, tools, and datasets that meet these stakeholder-defined needs.

This workshop built off of previous efforts of a Western Alaska LCC funded project to inventory, store, and display metadata for stream temperature monitoring efforts through the Alaska Online Aquatic Temperature site. Prior to the workshop, the project team developed a semi-structured questionnaire that assessed current data management practices among the stakeholders, their capacity for data management, and the desired capabilities of a data storage and management website. The workshop was used to discuss the results of this survey, assess other stream temperature efforts for application in Alaska, and explore best data management practices to ensure long term sustainability of stream temperature data.   The 2015 workshop helped to establish that the stakeholders and science-users in Alaska need an assessment of existing websites that provide various components of data management for stream temperature. The project team is working on this assessment and is also developing a HUC-8 prioritization strategy for stream temperature data collection for the entire state of Alaska based on existing instrumentation and other relevant parameters. This project aims to investigate stakeholder preferences for data management for stakeholders interested in conducting regional analyses of stream temperature data.

One of the greatest challenges for land use managers and stakeholders in Alaska is the discovery and accessibility of relevant scientific information and data. The effective dissemination and communication of science relies on improving access for stakeholders to discover research, management plans, and data within their geographic area of interest.   To respond to this need, the Northwest Boreal Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NWBLCC) has launched the Northwest Boreal Science and Management Research Tool. This tool allows users to search by keyword and geography to find relevant documents across the boreal region. With this tool, users can explore thousands of curated peer-reviewed scholarly journal articles, state and federal government resource reports, land use management plans, graduate student dissertations and theses and more. Each entry includes geographic information about the area of study, allowing users to draw a box on a map to narrow searches to information directly related to a specific region in Alaska, the Yukon, British Columbia, and Northwest Territories.   Researchers are now working to publicize and deliver the tool to land use managers and Alaska Native Tribes within the NWBLCC region.

The processes that produce thermokarst can lead to significant changes within the surrounding ecosystems, altering water quality, vegetation, and water, carbon, and nutrient storage and flows. These changes can have substantial implications for fish and wildlife populations and disrupt rural communities and infrastructure.   The goal of this project was to better understand the extent of thermokarst processes and the rate at which they are happening under climate change in northern Alaska. Researchers used a combination of mapping, literature review, and consultations with wildlife experts to assess thermokarst extent; possible impacts on fish, wildlife, and habitats; and the strengths and weaknesses of current and past efforts to monitor thermokarst. Researchers used these insights to develop and propose a plan for monitoring thermokarst on the North Slope of Alaska, a means to supply information that will build understanding of how climate change is reshaping the region\u2019s landscape and living things.

Understanding present and future snow conditions under climate change is critical for managing Alaska\u2019s natural resources, yet many scientists, land managers, and policymakers lack this information at useful scales. Hence, the goal of this project was to produce an advanced snow modeling system for part of the Arctic that predicts a variety of factors across space and time, including estimates of snowfall, snow depth, and changes in snow season length. The model was developed with collaborative input from ecologists, biologists, and geophysical scientists to determine which outputs would be most useful.

While a shallow near-surface soil layer (called active layer) thaws during the summer and re-freezes in the winter, the underlying permafrost remains perennially frozen, often underlying buildings, roads, and other infrastructure.  As warmer temperatures become more common, thawing of permafrost could have major consequences for Alaska. Where thawing has already occurred, dramatic changes in ecosystems and existing infrastructure are evident.  For example, thawing permafrost along the ocean shore and riverbanks in Northern Alaska is causing substantial coastal erosion and is impacting Native Alaska villages and threatening lives and properties.  Despite our current general understanding of how permafrost is changing and may change in the future, it is still very poorly understood how these changes will affect ecosystems and infrastructure on local and regional scales. To help provide this information, scientists are using the Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Model (IEM) to develop possible future scenarios of permafrost changes in the Alaskan Arctic and to estimate areas and rates of permafrost thaw and degradation.

Their survival and reproduction is dependent on sufficient winter habitat and food sources, which may be threatened by climate change.  During the winter, caribou eat lichens (organisms made up of algae and fungus) that grow on the snow-covered ground. Lichens will likely have a complex response to climate change, affected in different ways by factors like changing precipitation, wildfire, and competition with plants. For example, as temperatures warm, there will likely be less snow cover, exposing more of the lichen to caribou. Simultaneously, increased fire frequency could reduce lichen availability.  Moose, on the other hand, eat the twigs of deciduous shrubs that stick up above the snow. Unlike lichen, shrub habitats may actually be affected positively by increased fire. Warmer temperatures and less snow are also likely to increase shrub biomass.  Project researchers are using the Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Model to unravel some of these complex relationships and estimate the effects of climate change on food availability for these two species throughout most of Alaska and parts of Canada (from about 1970-2100). The resulting maps will be divided by land ownership and landscape characteristics to show expected changes in winter food for moose and caribou that will be tailored to and directly useable by natural resource managers as they devise strategies for adapting to a changing climate.

Researchers have so far evaluated the accuracy of the downscaled ERA-Interim temperature and precipitation simulations by comparing the downscaled estimates to actual observed conditions.   The downscaled ERA-Interim data can be used by stakeholders to investigate climate- and weather-related phenomena in Alaska.

Identifying how changing climate conditions impact Alaska\u2019s coastal ecosystems, and how these changes may be tied to the ability of coastal communities to adapt to changing conditions, has been identified as a priority question in the state.   In order to identify knowledge gaps and resource needs related to adaptation and resilience in coastal Alaska, the Alaska Climate Science Center partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association, and others in 2016 to hold a series of workshops in communities across coastal Alaska. These workshops brought together resource managers, tribal leaders, community planners, and scientists from tribes, state agencies, and federal agencies, with the goal of advancing coastal resilience and adaptation across the region.   Building on these workshops and previous coastal science studies, the focus is now on communicating key findings to coastal communities, and on developing actionable science strategies to address the identified needs of local communities. Researchers will also explore available tools that could support adaptation planning, such as tools for predicting coastal erosion, identifying storm surge impacts, and understanding wildlife response to a changing climate. Translating this technical information into public-friendly formats will ensure that the science on how coastal Alaska is changing can be easily used by local stakeholders to guide decision-making and adaptation planning efforts in coastal communities.

Berries supply essential nutrients that prevent heart disease and cancer, are used for medicinal purposes, and are the only sweet food in the traditional Native diet. Hence, berries have both nutritional and cultural significance.   From 2008 to 2012, wild berry populations in the Chugach region were decimated by an unexpected outbreak of moths, thought to have been brought about by shifting climate (i.e., warmer temperatures allowed a greater number of moths to survive the winter). This outbreak amounted to a total loss of blueberry and salmonberry harvests during these years, jeopardizing a tribal for-profit enterprise in the region. It also led to a need to restore berry production and to prepare for future threats from damaging insects.  The goal of this project was to create maps and models that would help tribal and other land managers identify prime areas for berry restoration. Researchers used a variety of information sources, including remote sensing imagery, field data, and local tribal knowledge, to develop and verify these products. The resulting maps and models are helping tribal forest managers and local landowners target their berry restoration efforts where they are most likely to be successful and protected from future insect outbreaks, contributing to the reestablishment and future resilience of wild berry populations.

There is ample literature on the effects of long-term climate change and short-term climate variability on the occurrence of droughts. However, it is unclear whether this information meets the needs of relevant stakeholders and actually contributes to reducing the vulnerability or increasing the resilience of communities to droughts. For example, are the methods used to characterize the severity of drought \u2013 known as drought indices \u2013 effective tools for predicting the actual damage felt by communities?   As droughts continue to increase in frequency and severity, the need to understand community vulnerability and resilience to drought is only growing. Focusing on New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, this study sought to answer several key questions. First, researchers examined whether existing drought indices are effective in predicting the occurrence of drought events and their actual damages. Second, researchers explored why some communities suffer less damage from drought and recover faster than others. Finally, researchers identified strategies for encouraging the adoption of water conservation behaviors among residents. So far, results show that drought indices are overall useful tools for predicting drought damage and that a community\u2019s resilience to drought is often tied to socioeconomic conditions.   This research was conducted in partnership with two Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. In addition to gaining the scientific knowledge of the linkages between drought indices, damages, and community resilience, this research (1) developed tools to measure drought resilience, (2) identified key indicators of resilience, (3) identified the gaps between drought indices and actual damages, and (4) identified the factors that influence residents\u2019 decisions to adopt adaptive measures.

These changes could adversely affect human and ecological communities. The ability to better predict future changes in precipitation and the response of hydrologic systems in the region could help mitigate their negative impacts. Yet while today\u2019s global climate models provide large-scale projections of future temperature and precipitation patterns that can be broadly useful for large-scale water resource planning, they are often not appropriate for use at a smaller, more local scale.  This research aimed to develop high-resolution climate projections for the Southern Great Plains that are better suited to informing water management at the local scale, with a focus on the Red River Valley. High resolution weather models can be used to downscale global climate model forecasts to provide more accurate local projections of future climate conditions for the Valley. These models are meant to be run multiple times, creating a spread of model outcomes that will provide insight into the range of possible climate futures for the region and reveal any uncertainties managers should be aware of when using the projections. The very high-resolution projections are expected to be used in the context of long-term hydrological modeling and management to inform cost-effective flood control planning, water supply management, hydroelectric power generation, and ecosystem conservation.

The multi-national, multi-state, ecologically diverse nature of this river makes management of the resource a complex task, especially in the context of more frequent droughts, changes in land use patterns, and increasing water use needs.  The purpose of this project was to review scientific monitoring and research reports and provide an overview of the state of the knowledge of the Upper Rio Grande-Rio Bravo Basin. The project researchers developed a report that synthesizes historical and geomorphic studies that describe the river\u2019s characteristics in the 1800s, its subsequent transformation caused by consumptive water use, dams, and physical manipulation of the channel, and a modern understanding of the natural and transformed flow regime. An extensive second section of the report focuses on aquatic ecology of the four major river segments of the Basin. In that section, the researchers summarize current understanding of the historical state compared to the contemporary state of the ecosystem, identify causes of ecosystem degradation, with an emphasis on those factors most affected by flow, and identify existing efforts to reverse ecosystem degradation, however intractable and dynamic these efforts may be. Finally, the project team summarized the state of knowledge of potential \u201cknobs\u201d that can be \u201cturned\u201d relating an ecological response to some component of flow management.

Current barriers to the incorporation of soil moisture data include a lack of consensus regarding how to best construct soil moisture-based drought indices, the challenges associated with integrating existing soil moisture data collected from diverse networks, and a lack of guidelines on how to apply these indices to different crop types.  The objective of this project was to build the necessary scientific foundation for soil moisture-based drought monitoring in the South Central region and beyond. This project was expected to produce effective soil moisture-based drought indices that decision-makers can use retrospectively or in real-time with data from existing monitoring networks to assess drought severity in the South Central region or across the US. Researchers also sought to create the first regional soil moisture database for the South Central US, which aimed to further support drought monitoring and other climate-related research efforts in this drought-prone region.

However, these large scale models are not fit for predicting smaller scale, local changes. Downscaling methods can be applied to the outputs of GCMs to give guidance appropriate for a more regional level. No standard approach to downscaling currently exists, however, and the process often results in climate projections that suggest a wide array of possible futures. It is critical that decision-makers looking to incorporate climate information understand the uncertainties associated with different downscaling approaches and can evaluate downscaled data to determine which datasets are appropriate for addressing their questions.  The goal of this project is to provide decision-makers with this information by evaluating the uncertainties associated with different downscaled datasets. Materials will then be developed to communicate these uncertainties to managers and explore how they can be incorporated into risk decision-making. The results will enable managers across the country to better understand possible climate futures in their jurisdictions, allowing them to make more informed planning decisions in the face of uncertainty.

Researchers at Texas Tech University found that lower daily temperature ranges of soil in the Southern High Plains were associated with higher levels of soil microbes (which help make critical nutrients available for plants) and decreased nitrogen availability. These results suggest that climate variability may have implications for soil health and microbial content. In the South Central U.S., a more developed understanding of how management practices, climate variability, and soil health interact is essential for sound agricultural decision-making.  This project implemented demonstration fields in which various sustainable management practices can be tested and their impacts on soil temperature and health can be monitored. The demonstration fields focused on cotton production and will test management practices related to water use efficiency, carbon storage, and soil health. In addition to demonstrating the effects of various management practices, these plots were designed to determine how much variability cotton production systems can tolerate before ecosystems and the services they provide are negatively affected.  This demonstration system is in high demand amongst regional stakeholders and was implemented with the support of the South\u2010Central USDA Climate Hub, NRCS scientists, and Cotton Inc. It was expected to contribute substantially to our collective understanding of the interactions between climate variability, soil health, and agricultural productivity in the Southern High Plains while equipping stakeholders with the knowledge they need to make appropriate management decisions for optimal agroecosystem health.

However, in the 21st century accelerated sea-level rise and coastal development are expected to greatly alter coastal landscapes across the globe. The future of coastal wetlands is uncertain, challenging coastal environmental managers to develop conservation strategies that will increase the resilience of these valuable ecosystems to change and preserve the benefits they provide.   One strategy for preparing for the effects of sea-level rise is to ensure that there is space available for coastal wetlands to adapt by migration. In a recent study, researchers identified areas where coastal wetlands may move inland along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, one of the most wetland-rich and sea-level rise sensitive regions of the world. Building on these findings, this project will produce customized landscape conservation-design products focused on identifying landward migration routes for coastal wetlands. The resulting products will provide environmental managers with information to make decisions to enhance the capacity of coastal wetlands to adapt to sea-level rise and coastal development, protecting these ecosystems and the critical economic and ecological benefits that they provide.

Therefore, connectivity, or the ability of organisms to move among habitat patches, is a critical component of landscape health. In addition to influencing the sustainability of wildlife populations and communities, connectivity also contributes to the availability of ecosystem services. The goal of this project was to evaluate terrestrial connectivity across the South Central United States, with a focus on the impact of projected climate and land use changes.  The researchers addressed this goal using a variety of approaches, including evaluating connectivity of major habitat types (grasslands and forests), predicting future changes in landscape connectivity for grassland species, assessing terrestrial vertebrate diversity in relation to habitat loss and fragmentation, and analyzing the combined effects of climate and habitat fragmentation on the distributions of grassland bird species.  They found that connectivity has declined for species with a low to moderate ability to move across the landscape, and that this pattern is expected to continue under future scenarios of land-use change. For grassland birds, the contribution of climate, landscape variables, and their combined effects varied among species, but their combined effects can exceed the independent effects of the two drivers for some species. Thus, the importance of connectivity is expected to increase with the negative implications of climate change for wildlife populations and communities. These results, which are expressed in maps, can be used to inform management decisions and identify future research needs related to terrestrial connectivity within this region.

Water moving through these aquifers carves out magnificent caves, sinkholes, and other formations. These formations are home to high concentrations of rare and endangered species, but the hydrological conditions that support these species can change rapidly. Managing these ecosystems into the future requires a better understanding of how climate, hydrology, and karst ecosystems interact.  The objective of this project was to determine how species and ecosystems associated with karst might respond to future temperature and precipitation extremes and accompanying changes in groundwater levels and springflow. The research focused on 16 species in the Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas and eight species in the Madison aquifer in western South Dakota. Researchers linked global climate models, regional climate models, and hydrologic models to determine how future springflow might be impacted by changes in temperature and precipitation. By combining information about future hydrology with what we know about species needs, researchers determined the vulnerability of the selected species to climate extremes.  Researchers found that more species in the Edwards aquifer are vulnerable to climate extremes than in the Madison aquifer, due in part to the more severe hydrologic changes that the Edwards aquifer is expected to undergo. This result suggests that including hydrologic factors critical to species health is essential in evaluating the vulnerability of karst ecosystems to climate extremes. Natural resource managers can use this information to understand how the character of karst systems are changing and prioritize conservation activities accordingly.

However, the potential effects of sea-level rise is posing new questions about the future availability of SAV for waterfowl and other coastal wildlife. Of primary concern is the fact that rising seas have the potential to increase salinities in fresh and brackish marshes on the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s coast, changing the distribution and composition of SAV communities, and affecting valuable waterfowl habitat and food resources. Not enough is known about the relationship between salinity and SAV to predict how this important food resource will respond to higher salinity levels, creating difficulties for waterfowl conservation planning.   This project identified the relationship between SAV, salinity, and other environmental variables as a first step in understanding how sea-level rise might affect food availability for waterfowl. The study examined coastal marshes of the northern Gulf of Mexico from Mobile Bay, AL, to the Nueces River, TX. Researchers compared SAV distribution and composition across a range of salinity levels, and found that water depth and salinity were the primary factors in determining the amount of SAV resources in a particular marsh. Surprisingly, researchers also found that brackish marsh tended to produce quantities of SAV waterfowl food resources similar to those in fresh marsh environments. The study also found some evidence that saline marshes contain less waterfowl food resources than brackish, intermediate, and fresh marshes.   This work will directly benefit efforts of the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, Gulf Coast Prairies Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC), and Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCC in forecasting the effects of sea-level rise on the distribution, abundance, and diversity of SAV resources and the priority fish and wildlife populations that depend upon them.

This type of precipitation is a significant driver of climate and ecosystem function in the region, but it is also notoriously difficult to predict since it occurs at such small spatial and temporal scales. While global climate models are helpful for understanding and predicting large-scale precipitation trends, they often do not capture many of the smaller atmospheric and earth surface processes that influence local and regional precipitation trends, like convective precipitation.  To address this gap in climate modeling capabilities, researchers developed regional climate models that are better able to project small-scale precipitation patterns and localized extreme precipitation events. Researchers combined information about land surface and water conditions with weather and climate models in order to quantify the local-scale impacts of climate on water resources. This highly localized information is expected to assist regional decision-makers in addressing the challenge of predicting precipitation in the South Central U.S., leading to a better understanding of potential future impacts on agriculture, fish and wildlife, water quality and availability, and cultural resources.

Black bear, bighorn sheep, mule deer, and wild turkey are just a few of the species found in these isolated mountain ecosystems that rise out of the desert landscape. However, recent droughts have crippled these ecosystems, causing significant tree death. Climate predictions suggest that this region will only face hotter and drier conditions in the future, potentially stressing these ecosystems even further. Simple models predict that vegetation will move to cooler and wetter locations in response to this warming. However, species responses will likely be more complex than these models show, as vegetation navigates other ecological stressors such as elevation change and water availability.  In order to better predict how vegetation will move in response to future warming, a more robust understanding of how drought and temperature impact tree survival is needed. Focusing on three sky island habitats in western Texas, this project sought to identify the key traits influencing current distributions of forest tree species, determine the susceptibility of these species to drought and temperature, and develop fine-scale, localized climate projections that model future conditions for the study area. This information is meant to be used to predict how species might shift location in response to warmer and drier future climates, enabling managers to make more robust decisions that will preserve sky island forests in the face of a changing climate.

In order to plan for future conditions and challenges, it is crucial that managers understand the limitations and uncertainties associated with the characterization of these changes when making management decisions. Changes in consumptive water use (water removed without return to a water resources system) will change streamflow, impacting downstream water users, their livelihoods, as well as aquatic ecosystems. Historical changes in available water may be attributed to changes in precipitation; but these changes may also be attributable to changes in consumptive use. Understanding the roles of natural and anthropogenic influences on the water cycle is an important component of this project. The objective of this project was to provide an automated methodology and data products that the public can view, work with, and download through ScienceBase to assess: the accuracy of available climate data and climate projections, the hydrologic effects of these drivers on runoff for historical and future conditions, and the role of consumptive water use on available water supply.

However, this approach assumes that models that reliably project past climate conditions will accurately predict future climate conditions, even though the climate system might have changed.    This research contributes to generating more reliable local-scale climate projections by testing the assumption that the climatological relationships which existed in the past will continue to exist in the future. To do this, researchers developed a novel approach in which very high-resolution climate model data were used as a surrogate for historical and future \"observations\", allowing researchers to test how well the more commonly-used coarse-scale global climate models project future climate conditions.  Findings suggest that the assumption holds reasonably well in many cases, but there are some instances (for example in particular geographic locations, such as coastal regions, and at certain times of year, especially summer) when the assumption is not as robust. This research also explores the conditions under which the assumption does not hold, and develops ways to make the methods used to generate local information about climate change more reliable.

In the United States, the ecosystem services provided by wetlands are worth billions of dollars and include flood protection, erosion control, seafood, water quality enhancement, carbon storage, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Unfortunately, these ecosystems are also highly sensitive to changing climate conditions. Past research on climate impacts to coastal wetlands have concentrated primarily on sea-level rise, largely ignoring the important influence of changing temperature and precipitation patterns. Understanding the impact of temperature and precipitation on coastal wetlands can help natural and cultural resource managers account for these factors when making decisions or developing adaptation plans.  This study advances understanding of how temperature and precipitation influence coastal wetland ecosystems. The study models the relationships between wetland plant community structure and climate in the northern Gulf of Mexico and identifies potential impacts of future climate conditions on these ecosystems. The researchers identify critical ecological thresholds and demonstrate that transformative ecological changes due to climatic shifts are probable throughout the Gulf of Mexico within this century. In certain areas, small changes in temperature or rainfall are expected to trigger large ecological changes and affect certain ecosystem services. Because coastal wetland ecosystems in other parts of the world are also sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, the findings of this research have global implications, helping to inform the management of these highly valuable ecosystems under a changing climate.

Further, 74% of the jurisdictional boundaries of the Chickasaw and Choctaw Tribes are located within the basin.   Water resources in the basin have been stressed in recent years due to a multi-year drought and increasing demands for consumptive use by metropolitan areas in Oklahoma and Texas.

The goal of this project is to provide resource managers with critical information on the impacts of climate change on flow in the Red River Basin. Researchers (1) used global climate models to make climate projections for the basin, and (2) developed models to determine the impacts of projected future climate conditions on stream flow. The modeling results can be used to evaluate future water supplies for water providers and flows for the environment.   The Red River Basin lies within the boundaries of three Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs), and the results of this project will help the LCCs and other managers reduce the impacts of floods and droughts and make decisions regarding the potential need for additional reservoirs or diversions of water into the Red River Basin.

Researchers examined where these species currently occur in order to better understand the environmental, especially climate, conditions necessary for their survival. Climate and land use change projections for 2050 and 2070 were used to assess the potential future distributions of conditions suitable for these species.  Maps evaluating patterns of loss of suitable conditions for the species were developed and incorporated into the publicly accessible New Mexico state-level CHAT (Crucial Habitat Assessment Tool). CHATs are being used by states across the western U.S. to facilitate conservation and project planning, and are useful to decision-makers at all levels of government.

However, dramatic declines of freshwater mussels have occurred due to habitat loss, destruction and modification, pollution, and invasive species. One mussel species in Texas (Texas Hornshell) has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and several other species are candidates for listing.  Changes in precipitation patterns and extremes, such as drought and floods, can also be detrimental to mussels. Freshwater mussels are particularly sensitive to drought events because they are relatively sessile and cannot easily escape to wetter areas. Mussels can also be washed out of suitable habitat during flooding or become stranded in habitat that later dries out.

In addition, this study will look at the likelihood and environmental implications of rivers in southeast Oklahoma drying out \u2013 specifically impacts on fish populations \u2013 and the ability of these species to return to the rivers once normal flow conditions are restored."}, {"node": 99, "name": "The Effects of Wildfire on Snow Water Resources under Multiple Climate Conditions", "casc": "South Central CASC", "fy": "2017", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/594aa2dfe4b062508e36f465", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "The Colorado and Rio Grande Rivers provide drinking water to millions of people in the Southwest and South Central U.S. Snowmelt accounts for 70% of streamflow in these rivers, meaning that water use downstream is directly impacted by snow accumulation and snowmelt patterns in the mountains. Mountain forests are a critical part of the hydrologic cycle that feeds these rivers, providing water supply and storage. However wildfire, which is becoming more common as temperatures rise, can disrupt the role of mountain forests in the hydrologic cycle. Uncertainty about the interactions between wildfire and snow-water, and how these interactions may change as climate conditions shift, impedes effective water resource planning in the region.  Until recently, there has been no method available to characterize the potential effects of forest fire on snow-water (water from melted snow) resources. This project will combine two newly developed models that will for the first time allow an accurate analysis of the effects of wildfire on snow-water resources, under current and possible future climate conditions. Researchers will focus on the Las Conchas Fire burn zone in New Mexico\u2019s Jemez Mountains, where approximately 156,000 acres were burned in 2011. However, the framework developed to complete this study will be relevant to forested regions throughout the world where snow-water resources overlap potential burn areas.  The results of this project will improve snow-water forecasting, and therefore water resource planning. For example, the National Weather Service plans on using the results to improve their forecasting capabilities in snowmelt-driven basins that have been impacted by wildfire.

Resource managers face the challenge of apportioning scarce water resources among competing uses, but they lack a systematic framework for comparing the costs and benefits of proposed water management decisions and conservation actions.  In 2016, Co-PIs Neeson and Moreno were funded by the Great Plains LCC to develop a decision support model for identifying the most cost-effective water conservation alternatives across the Red River basin. Here, we propose to extend this optimization model in three significant ways to support cost-effective conservation decisions in the face of climate change and drought. First, we will incorporate SC CSC-developed predictions of rainfall, runoff, and stream flows through the year 2099 into our hydrologic database. Using this database, our enhanced optimization model will enable decision-makers to visualize and evaluate multiple competing water use scenarios under future drought conditions. Second, we will use SC-CSC predictions of stream flows and temperature through the year 2099 to estimate the future distributions of 28 fish species of conservation concern across the Red River. These future distribution maps will enable conservation practitioners to proactively manage species projected to be at greatest risk from declining water availability. Third, we will extend our optimization model to enable decision-makers to explicitly quantify trade-offs between competing water uses and ecological outcomes under multiple use scenarios. In doing so, our optimization model will provide resource managers with a means to identify conservation strategies that maximize outcomes for Great Plains stream ecosystems while meeting growing societal needs for water."}, {"node": 101, "name": "Cultivating a Climate Science Learning Community Amongst Tribal Water Managers", "casc": "South Central CASC", "fy": "2017", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/594aa2f0e4b062508e36f46e", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "In previous climate trainings conducted for tribes and pueblos in Oklahoma and New Mexico, impacts to water resources have emerged as a priority concern.

These workshops, some virtual and some face-to-face, will allow water management professionals to discuss emerging issues with climate scientists, cultivate a community of practice, and increase their capacity for successful climate adaptation.  Through the workshops, water resource professionals will collaborate to understand the latest developments in climate science. Additionally, they will develop an understanding of effective ways to cultivate a community of learning professionals, with an awareness of best practices of other Nations. The Native American Nations \u2013 with people vulnerable to climate change, and governments that can greatly empower regional adaptation efforts \u2013 will benefit from the establishment of a learning community.

Some projections estimate that future sea-level rise could exceed the average elevation of these islands by 2100. Already, residents are facing extreme high tides and 16 foot swells that flood the islands with saltwater, damaging homes and infrastructure and contaminating the freshwater supply.  Land elevation is the primary factor that determines the vulnerability of coastal areas to inundation. This project builds on previous work in which a 1-meter resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was developed for Majuro Atoll, home to the capital and largest city in the Marshall Islands. Researchers will use this DEM to map areas of Majuro Atoll that are vulnerable to inundation, based on different water level scenarios. For example, these maps can be used to answer the question of which areas would flood should seas rise by 0.4, 0.8, or 1 meter, and will represent the first detailed assessment of sea-level rise vulnerability for Majuro.  The results of this project will support assessments of how future inundation events could impact ecosystems, infrastructure, the freshwater supply, and agroforestry on Majuro Atoll. This much-needed information will provide government authorities and local community groups with an improved understanding of the types of actions needed to prepare for future inundation and an estimated timeline for when these actions would best be implemented."}, {"node": 1, "name": "Near-term Climate Projections to Inform Adaptation in the Hawaiian Islands", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2017", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59ef93fae4b0220bbd991181", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "Land, water, and natural resource managers and planners across Hawai\u2019i are tasked with making important decisions about the state\u2019s future.

In Hawai\u02bbi, efforts to conserve native forests have come into conflict with objectives to sustain non-native game mammals, such as feral pigs, goats, and deer, for subsistence and sport hunting. Maintaining stable or increasing game populations represents one of the greatest obstacles to the recovery of Hawaii\u2019s 425 threatened and endangered plant species. Many endemic Hawaiian species have declined and become endangered as a result of herbivorous non-native game mammals. Meanwhile, other environmental changes, including the spread of invasive grasses and changing precipitation patterns and wildfire regimes could further interact to alter the distribution and range of native plants.   This project will address the need to optimally balance long-term endangered plant recovery with non-native game management. Focusing on the islands of Maui and L\u0101na\u02bfi, researchers will map the distribution of game species and native plant species, then use these maps to identify zones that would be optimal for plant conservation, and others for game management. This analysis will take into account both the current distribution and potential future distribution of game and plant species, as climate conditions change. The results of this project will support both federal and state land managers in Hawai\u02bfi.

As a result, predictions of future inundation often underestimate the timing and magnitude of future flooding, because they are only considering one part of the picture.    The National Park Service (NPS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) need accurate projections of inundation and flooding in order to develop effective adaptation plans that can help avoid or reduce the loss of invaluable natural and cultural resources and costly damage to critical infrastructure in the USAPI. To address this need, researchers will model future coastal flooding based on different plausible scenarios of storm- and sea-level rise-induced flooding in Hawai\u02bbi and the USAPI. This effort will result in high-resolution (~10 m2) maps of potential future inundation at national parks in Hawai\u02bbi, Guam, Saipan, and American Samoa and national wildlife refuges on the islands of Maui, O\u02bbahu, Kaua\u02bbi, Moloka\u02bbi, and Guam. Researchers will also assess what the different inundation scenarios could mean for natural and biological resources on these islands. The results will help to reduce the risk and increase the resiliency of NPS and USFWS lands on low-lying islands and provide sound scientific guidance for current and future NPS and USFWS management decisions."}, {"node": 14, "name": "The Future Resiliency of Mangrove Forests to Sea-Level Rise in the Western Pacific: Initiating a National Assessment Approach", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2019", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d5ef403e4b01d82ce97cd1e", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "Sea-level rise will eventually flood and kill many coastal mangrove trees. The loss of mangrove forests will strongly affect human populations on isolated western Pacific islands as they rely heavily on mangroves for food, such as fish, shrimp, and crabs; building materials; and fire wood. Mangroves also shelter coastal communities from the impacts of tsunamis and cyclones, are home to endangered species such as the Yapese monarch and flying fox, and remove and store CO2 from the atmosphere. In the past, mangroves have adjusted to sea-level rise through tree root growth and the accumulation of sediments from rivers and oceans, processes which allow them to maintain their forest floor elevation relative to sea level. However, in light of the projected acceleration of the rate of sea-level rise, as well as modifications made to coastal environments that impede their ability to respond, it is unclear how mangrove forests will respond to future conditions.   Identifying which mangrove forests are most affected by sea-level rise allows us to determine how to protect them today so that they can continue to support humans and wildlife tomorrow. Mangroves in the western Pacific contain some of the most pristine and productive ecosystems in the world, but very little data is available in this region to predict mangrove vulnerability or resilience. This project is building on an existing mangrove monitoring network created by the U.S. Forest Service, the USGS, and the Micronesia Conservation Trust in the Federated States of Micronesia to assess the vulnerability of mangrove forests to sea-level rise to inform management planning. Focusing on the islands of Kosrae and Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia, researchers will identify which mangroves are keeping up with sea-level rise and which are not, and then model potential changes in the ecosystems that could occur.   This information will then be shared with state management agencies and local conservation organizations on both islands, including the Conservation Society of Pohnpei and the Kosrae Island Resource Management Authority, so that managers can identify what can be done to increase the ability of mangroves to keep up with sea-level rise. For example, moving roads or bridges so that mangroves can migrate inland or restoring connections to streams so that sediments can be deposited onto the mangrove forest floor could both support mangrove resiliency. Meanwhile, mangroves that are building elevation and adapting to sea-level rise should be protected from deforestation and maintained in that state for as long as possible. Increasing or protecting the ability of mangroves to keep up with sea-level rise will mean that these ecosystems can continue their role of supporting subsistence economies and diverse ecological communities in the Pacific Islands.

For example, 61% of native flowering Hawaiian plant species are either bird pollinated or dispersed through ingestion by birds. However, native bird communities across Hawai\u02bbi continue to decline despite efforts to control predators and enhance habitat. These declines are, in part, due to the mosquito-borne avian pox and avian malaria.  Scientific forecasts of the impact of avian disease on native bird populations under various climate change scenarios predict severe declines and species extinctions in all remaining forest habitat within the next 50 years. While little can currently be done to mitigate the effects of climate change on disease vectors, recent innovations in mosquito suppression and eradication may provide new tools to control or eliminate disease vectors from forest bird habitat. State and federal biologists across Hawai\u02bbi have made mosquito control a conservation priority and are currently focusing on developing the Wolbachia-based Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) to suppress mosquito populations. This technique involves using naturally-occurring strains of the bacteria Wolbachia to cause mosquito incompatibility (where mosquito sperm and eggs are unable to form viable offspring) and infertility. Sustained releases of male mosquitoes infected with incompatible Wolbachia can help to suppress wild mosquito populations.  To meet regulatory approval for the use of Wolbachia and achieve successful suppression of mosquitos, key ecological parameters (population density, dispersal, and survivorship of the mosquitos) need to first be assessed. These parameters help to inform the number of Wolbachia-infected mosquitos to release as well as the location and timing of their release. This project will use Mark-release-recapture (MRR) techniques to gather information about mosquito populations in selected areas in Hawai\u2019i. The MRR process includes capturing, marking, and releasing a portion of the population, and then later, capturing another portion and counting the number of marked individuals within the sample. This sampling will both improve the ability to detect and monitor mosquito populations and inform the use of IIT in the future for suppressing mosquitos. Results from this project will be directly useful to the conservation efforts of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office, and other resource management groups in Hawai\u02bbi."}, {"node": 16, "name": "Understanding Sediment Transport to Coastal Waters and Coral Reefs in West Maui", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2015", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/559eb2e7e4b0b94a64018fd9", "num_items": 2, "items": {"5914ac9ce4b0e541a03e9ad5": {"title": "Final Project Report: Mapping and environmental science to support clean reefs of West Maui, Hawaii", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5914ac9ce4b0e541a03e9ad5"}, "58213484e4b08f3b91767f13": {"title": "Data for Mapping and Environmental Science to Support Clean Reefs of West Maui, Hawai'i", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58213484e4b08f3b91767f13"}}, "summary": "Coral ecosystems of West Maui support a vibrant tourism industry and provide tangible economic benefits to the community. Hawaiian nearshore reefs generate about $800 million in annual revenue, not including the ecosystem services they provide - such as critical habitat for diverse fish species and buffering coasts from storm surges. The Hawaiian economy depends on healthy coral ecosystems, yet reefs are currently facing multiple threats, including changing climate conditions, local land-based pollution, and sediment erosion.  Erosion of soils into nearshore coastal zones is a chief concern facing land managers in West Maui. Intermittent rainfall can carry sediment from sources such as dirt roads, agricultural fields, streambanks, and disturbed forests into estuaries and the ocean. These sediments can block light that corals need for photosynthesis, essentially smothering them. Sediment also affects coastal user enjoyment by reducing water quality.  The goal of this project was to map, monitor, and analyze recent and historic rainfall to estimate sources of sediment for watersheds in West Maui. Researchers described how much sediment was entering the water from different land-based sources, to create a sediment budget for two watersheds in West Maui. Researchers found that current sediment deposition into coastal waters is likely due to the erosion of streambank terraces located downstream of former agricultural fields. These terraces are remnants of old agricultural land management practices in which soil and rock waste were pushed from fields into streams. It\u2019s estimated that this source results in over 90 dump truck loads of fine sediment entering West Maui\u2019s nearshore environment each year.  The information gathered from this project has already been used to inform a tool for estimating streambank erosion and sediment runoff into coastal zones during rainfall events. This tool can help resource managers and planners assess how different management options could help reduce the amount of sediment entering coastal waters."}, {"node": 17, "name": "Building Capacity for Coordination of Strategic Science Research in the  US-Affiliated Pacific Islands", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2015", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589a36bfe4b0efcedb71a61c", "num_items": 2, "items": {"589b5ee6e4b0efcedb72d31d": {"title": "An Inventory of Climate Change Projects in select United States Affiliated Pacific Islands (Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands)", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589b5ee6e4b0efcedb72d31d"}, "589b6384e4b0efcedb72d33d": {"title": "Preliminary Geospatial Data and Training Needs Assessment to Increase USAPI Capacity", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589b6384e4b0efcedb72d33d"}}, "summary": "Small Pacific islands are especially vulnerable to climate change.

These include climate change, climate variability, and drought (referred to collectively as CCVD). Climate variability describes how the climate fluctuates on a yearly basis around average values, while climate change describes patterns of long-term continuous change in the average.   While it is understood that CCVD will exert a growing influence on Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s ecosystems and communities, there is currently little information on the historic impacts of CCVD in the region.

The Hawai\u02bbi Department of Land and Natural Resources, local planning departments, and other coastal management agencies are using this project\u2019s data and maps for hazard preparedness and adaptation planning on state and local scales. Results were incorporated into a statewide study of shoreline sea-level rise vulnerability led by the Hawai\u02bbi State Interagency Climate Adaptation Committee. While this study focused on Kaua\u02bbi, it established a methodology for predicting future beach erosion that is now being applied to other areas of the state to improve coastal management decision making.

The Marshallese have a long tradition of interplanting food-producing trees such as coconuts, breadfruit, and pandanus with bananas and root and vegetable crops. Locally grown food crops support community self-sufficiency, promote good nutrition, and can also serve as windbreaks and stabilize shorelines to lessen storm damage and erosion. However, climate change is posing serious challenges for growers, as they struggle to adapt to climate impacts including saltwater intrusion, changing precipitation and temperature patterns, and the spread of invasive species.  The goal of this project was to provide Marshallese agricultural producers with information and resources that will help them adapt their growing practices to changing climate conditions. Researchers are creating a living website that provides clear, actionable farming information displayed in a dashboard format. Users can find information in English and Marshallese about seasonal rainfall, winds, and sea level as well as agricultural calendars based on El Ni\u00f1o/ La Ni\u00f1a. The website also provides facts on traditional growing practices and timings, crop tolerances, and nutrition. Pages can be downloaded, printed, and distributed by local agricultural extension services.  This project was implemented by Marshallese partners at the Ministry of Resources and Development, College of the Marshall Islands, and Land Grant program, and external partners from the University of Hawai\u02bbi, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service.

It is important to be able to predict how Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s streams will be affected by changing rainfall patterns to enable sustainable management of critical freshwater resources. However, to date, limited data and the uncertain effects of climate change have hindered predictions of future streamflow.  Through this project, scientists developed a model that provides a way to estimate future stream low flow (streamflow during a period of prolonged dryness) by categorizing streams based on their physical characteristics. While the model is based on data from gaged streams (i.e., those fitted with measuring devices to monitor streamflow), it allows researchers to also predict streamflow at ungaged (unmonitored) sites and thus develop island- or state-wide predictions of stream response to future rainfall conditions.  Researchers used the model to forecast flow changes in Maui streams under two possible end-of-century future climate scenarios. Results indicate that in areas where rainfall is projected to decrease in the future, stream low flow may decrease by more than 50 percent in some areas, and habitat for native species may decrease by more than 25 percent in some streams. The methods developed for this study can be transferred to other Pacific islands as well as non-island settings.

In many parts of the world, this decrease in temperature is a limiting factor for vegetation\u2014at certain elevations, the temperature becomes too cold for plants to survive. However in the tropics, moisture availability may play a more important role than temperature in determining the altitude at which forests can grow. For example on Haleakal\u0101, a volcano on the Hawaiian Island of Mau\u02bbi, the forest line is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. Rather, the forest line is highest in the wetter eastern-most end and lower on the drier, western end of the volcano.   Research also suggests that short-duration extreme climate events that cause changes in moisture, such as El Ni\u00f1o, can control the upper limit of forests more than long-term average climate does. This is because species found at the forest line are often already near their physiological limits, so extreme changes can have a big effect on their survival.    A strong El Ni\u00f1o occurred in Hawai\u02bbi in 2015 and provided researchers with a unique opportunity to observe how vegetation responds to ensuing climate variability. Researchers are focusing on Metrosideros polymorpha, a species of flowering evergreen native to Hawai\u02bbi. This species is the dominant canopy tree found near the forest line and will be used as an indicator for how the forest line responds to El Ni\u00f1o-driven drought. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to: (1) Observe the climate and ecosystem processes at locations near and above the forest line on Haleakal\u0101 during an El Ni\u00f1o event. (2) Determine how the ecosystem responds to changes in climate, such as drought, caused by El Ni\u00f1o. (3) Determine whether plant responses to short-term changes in climate and drought vary along the cross-slope rainfall gradient.

Already, high elevation areas have experienced rapidly increasing temperatures and there has been an increase in the frequency of drought across the Islands. These climatic changes could have significant impacts on Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s plants and animals. Changes in temperature and moisture may make current habitat no longer suitable for some species, and could allow invasive species to spread into new areas.   Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park is home to 23 species of endangered vascular plants and 15 species of endangered trees. Understanding how climate change may impact the park\u2019s plants is vital for their long-term survival. This project was designed to assist managers of Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park in preparing for a changing climate by identifying how plant distributions within the park may shift under future climate conditions. Researchers focused on the park\u2019s Special Ecological Areas \u2013 sites of critical importance roughly configured to protect representative plant communities and important species by controlling the most invasive incipient plants and animals. Researchers aimed to identify how plants may migrate to new locations and contract from current locations as species distributions respond to habitat suitability under future climate conditions, and map future plant species ranges. This information will then be used resource managers to determine whether the boundaries of the Special Ecological Areas need to be adjusted to account for future shifts in plant ranges.   Information on how climate change may alter plant distributions, including those of endangered and culturally-significant species, is required for effective management of the park\u2019s ecosystems into the future. The results of this project can help park managers overcome one of the greatest hurdles facing resource managers today \u2013 developing climate adaptation strategies in the face of an uncertain future."}, {"node": 30, "name": "Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2012", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/50118f9fe4b0d78fd4e59ba6", "num_items": 5, "items": {"57ec5fbce4b090825010b908": {"title": "Predicted climate and avian malaria risk to Hawaiian honeycreepers on the Island of Hawaii from 2098-2100", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57ec5fbce4b090825010b908"}, "563a3bd1e4b0d6133fe733c5": {"title": "Will a warmer and wetter future cause extinction of native Hawaiian forest birds?", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/563a3bd1e4b0d6133fe733c5"}, "5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025": {"title": "Final Project Report for \"Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation\"", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5877a81ce4b0315b4c120025"}, "5894fdaae4b0fa1e59b86a32": {"title": "Project Snapshot: Vulnerability of Hawaiian Forest Birds to Climate Change - Using Models to Link Landscape, Climate, Disease, and Potential Adaptation", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5894fdaae4b0fa1e59b86a32"}, "5877a9d9e4b0315b4c120031": {"title": "Mitigating Future Avian Malaria Threats to Hawaiian Forest Birds from Climate Change", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5877a9d9e4b0315b4c120031"}}, "summary": " The Hawaiian Islands are home to some of the world\u2019s most culturally valuable but imperiled forest birds, including brightly colored native honeycreepers, many of which are threatened or endangered. One of the major threats these birds face is avian malaria, which is spread by a species of introduced mosquito and can have death rates exceeding 90 percent. For decades, upper mountain forests have provided refuge for Hawaiian forest birds because mosquitoes (and thus the disease) could not survive the cooler temperatures. However, warming associated with climate change could change this. Scientists used climate data and an epidemiological model to evaluate the future impacts of avian malaria on Hawaiian forest birds as a result of climate change. Results show that over the current century, anticipated changes in temperature and rainfall will favor increased mosquito populations and their expansion into high-elevation forests. These findings suggest that without significant intervention and mosquito control measures, many native Hawaiian honeycreepers will suffer major population declines and/or extinction due to increasing risk from avian malaria.

However, to date, available global climate models have been too coarse in resolution to be useful for planning in the context of small, isolated islands.  This project produced the first-ever set of high-resolution climate projections for Guam and American Samoa, providing information on key variables of interest to decision makers such as rainfall, air temperature, and tropical cyclone patterns. Modeling results suggest that both territories are expected to become warmer and experience a higher number of extreme rainfall events through the current century. In addition, American Samoa is projected to become wetter overall, with a mean rainfall increase of up to 25 percent by the late 21st century, and Guam may be subject to a higher frequency of strong tropical cyclones. These data are intended for use by other researchers to inform hydrological and ecosystem models and, ultimately, aid local decision makers as they plan for climate change impacts and seek to reduce risk through effective adaptation.

The plant was once considered a conservation success, when active management led to a population recovery in the early 20th century. Unfortunately, silversword populations are now declining, and climate change \u2013 namely decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures \u2013 is thought to be responsible.   The goal of this project was to collect data on both silverswords and climate conditions to pinpoint the exact cause of silversword declines and to predict how the species will fare under potential future climate scenarios. Researchers aimed to identify management strategies that might help restore silversword populations. So far, results have shown that silversword populations have declined by about 60% since 1990, and that this decline coincides with lower rainfall.   The prominence of the silversword within the Hawaiian alpine ecosystem renders it one of the more visible examples of climate change-induced biodiversity loss. Identifying the specific climatic variables that are contributing to the silversword population decline will help Park managers determine which management actions will be necessary to protect this iconic species into the future.

The goal of this project was to better understand how Hawaiian native and invasive plants will respond to climate change. Scientists focused on 10 important native and five important invasive plant species, using over 35 years of data from thousands of locations in Hawai\u2018i to assess the plants\u2019 preferred climate conditions and model their likely best future habitat based on climate change projections. The resulting maps and findings provide an initial set of decision support tools to help resource managers identify key locations for conserving native plants (and the birds and insects that rely on them) and for anticipating and controlling the spread of invasive plant species.

The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) spreads over 29 atolls and has a population of over 50,000 people with homes and communities that may be threatened by these climate change-related events.  Policy makers, planners, and others within RMI are faced with decisions about how to prepare for the future and need scientific data and information about the vulnerability of Pacific Islands to potential climate change impacts like sea-level rise. Topographic and bathymetric data are needed to map out the overland and underwater formations that comprise RMI.  These maps can then be used to calculate and visualize potential effects and damage from wave inundation and other coastal hazards.  To help address this need, the Pacific Islands Climate Science Center is collaborating with the USGS Coastal National Elevation Database (CoNED) program to collect topographic and bathymetric data and develop a Digital Elevation Model (a 3D representation of the terrain) for the southern half of Majuro Atoll (home to the capital city and largest population of RMI) that can be used to visualize and project climate change impacts.

Sea level rise threatens the very existence of RMI as high-end projections of sea level rise by the end of the century exceed the average elevation of these low atoll reef islands. Already, waves wash over Majuro during \u201cking tides\u201d when strong winds blow from the west across the broad lagoon, or when there are high open ocean waves. Flooding waves breach island shores in multiple locations and wash into homes, cemeteries, across roads, and into commercial districts. Over the past decade, there has been a widespread exodus of residents to locations in Hawai\u02bbi and the continental U.S. as life becomes increasingly untenable on these low sand and gravel islands.  In order for Majuro and RMI leaders and decision makers to plan and implement a strategy for moving forward, scientific information and geospatial data are needed to model the timing and spatial pattern of future flooding in the first and most vulnerable areas. This project team will use a digital elevation model (DEM), currently under development, for the Majuro Atoll to model sea level rise and develop flooding simulations to help identify vulnerable areas. The team will also collect topographic and bathymetric data on Majuro to extend the areas covered by the DEM to provide a more comprehensive view of future wave flooding associated with sea level rise.  In later years of the project, the team plans to utilize existing data on groundwater and collect new information on Majuro\u2019s water table to model and understand water table dynamics in order to simulate inundation of saltwater into groundwater due to sea level rise. A primary goal of this project is to distribute project deliverables and provide training in their interpretation and application to Marshallese government agencies to inform mitigation and adaptation.

Persistent drought is further affecting agricultural production in the RMI. Many Marshallese communities are already experiencing these changes and are migrating to larger islands within the RMI and to other countries like the U.S. to, among other things, seek alternative means of making a living and access healthcare.  The number of Marshallese residing in the U.S. has rapidly risen over the past two decades, from 7,000 in 2000 to 22,000 in 2010. There is also substantial internal migration, mainly from outer islands to the main atoll of Majuro. However, we do not know to what extent Marshallese people are already migrating because of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services\u2014nor do we know whether this migration can be regarded as a successful adaptation strategy. The factors triggering human migration are complex and often intertwined, making it difficult to pinpoint and address specific causes from a public policy perspective. For example, changes in ecosystems due to climate change can cause health problems or food insecurity, which may have greater consequences in communities with political, social, or economic tension.  Decision makers at local and state levels in both the RMI and U.S.\u2014for example those who design policy related to immigrant access to services\u2014need information to better understand the factors contributing to current migration and to anticipate possible future impacts of climate on human migration. Also, a better understanding is needed of how migration impacts livelihoods and well being in the island to which migrants arrive and in the areas in which they settle.  This research project will study the nature of Marshallese migration and its effects on migrants, themselves, and communities in source and destination areas. There are three central research questions:    \tTo what extent are climatic stressors, and their impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods and habitability, already driving migration in RMI? \tWhat are the impacts of migration in source and destinations areas? \tHow do migration reasons and consequences vary among different types of respondents?  This project will examine the extent to which we can identify direct and indirect links between patterns of human migration and climate events. As a next step, the projects\u2019 research findings on migration decision-making could be integrated into agent-based models that use projections of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services to understand which islands and communities are at highest risk and from where we can expect most migration to take place in the future.

Once it reaches the ground, rain can either run off and contribute to water flow in streams, or it can infiltrate into the ground and provide water for plants and recharge aquifers and groundwater. The exact route that water takes is controlled by many factors, including the duration and intensity of rainfall, the topography of the land, soil properties, and vegetation.   The introduction and spread of invasive plants and animals in Hawaiian forests, which alters the water-use and soil characteristics of ecosystems, can have large impacts on downstream water users. Increased demand and competition for limited water resources in Hawai\u02bbi has underscored the need for a better understanding of this relationship; however, relevant statewide data is currently lacking.   The objective of this project is to understand how expanding invasive plant populations and changing rainfall patterns will impact water resources in the future. Project researchers are exploring the differences in key soil characteristics that control runoff and groundwater recharge in managed and relatively intact native mesic (moderate amounts of water) and wet forests and in similar invasive-dominated forests. Primary soil characteristics of interest are the hydraulic conductivity of soils (ability of water to move through soils) and soil hydrophobicity (a property that causes water to collect on the surface rather than infiltrating into the ground). Data will also be collected on the canopy and understory composition in the forests and on disturbances by invasive animals, like feral pigs. Results from the study will be presented in reports and maps of vegetation and soil characteristics across the Hawaiian Islands under current and future conditions.

Estimates of the changes in water availability during periods of drought are critical to Hawai\u2018i\u2019s water, forest, and wildfire managers and planners, as well as to agriculturists and ranchers for developing adaptive management strategies.  This study addresses this specific information need and will lead to a better understanding of the hydrologic impacts of drought throughout the State of Hawai\u2018i. Specific objectives of the study are (1) to estimate changes in soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge during periods of drought for current and projected climate conditions, and (2) to estimate the combined impact of drought and reduced fog drip on soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge.  The results from this study will inform resource managers of the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and the importance of fog drip in mitigating the impacts of drought. This study will also provide needed input for supporting science-based strategies for managing critical groundwater recharge areas and identifying areas vulnerable to wildfires. The results will be a great value to forest and water-resource managers, watershed partnerships striving to protect, preserve, and restore large areas of forested watersheds for water-resource and conservation values, and outreach agents seeking to reduce the threat of wildfire to ecosystems and communities by facilitating the sharing of fire knowledge.

The river supplies water to approximately 36 million people, irrigates nearly six million acres of farmland within and beyond the basin, and contributes an estimated 26 billion dollars each year to the region\u2019s recreational economy. Yet the Colorado River\u2019s water supply is already fully allocated, meaning that the economic and environmental health of the region is closely tied to the river\u2019s streamflow.   Climate projections for the Southwest show a future marked by chronic drought and substantial reductions in streamflow. The region has already been impacted by climate change, experiencing warmer temperatures and more intense drought, particularly in late spring and early summer, resulting in reduced streamflow. In order to appropriately manage the Colorado River under changing conditions, water resource planners require reliable projections of future streamflow.   This project seeks to characterize how changing climate conditions affect cool and warm season precipitation in the Colorado River basin and the corresponding impacts on streamflow. Specifically, researchers will examine whether human-caused climate change interacts with natural variations in climate (such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation) intensify climate extremes, such as severe drought. Researchers will implement a new technique to downscale global climate model data, to produce more accurate streamflow projections that can be used to make local- and regional-scale water management decisions.

California receives 80% of its precipitation during the winter, so mountain snowpack plays a critical role in replenishing the state\u2019s water supply.   One factor that affects the amount of winter precipitation (and therefore snowpack) in California is the North Pacific Jet (NPJ)\u2014a current of strong, high altitude winds that occur over the northern Pacific Ocean. Winters when the NPJ is located further north than normal are drier than average in California, while winters when the NPJ is located further south are wetter. Climate change is expected to cause the position of the NPJ to become more variable, which could greatly influence California\u2019s water resources and ecosystems.   The goal of this project is to identify the relationship between the NPJ and wildfires in California. Researchers will first use tree-ring data to examine variability in the position of the NPJ over the past 400+ years to identify historical trends. They will then use historical fire data to determine how the NPJ has influenced wildfire patterns in the past. Finally, researchers will look at recent fire data to see if this historical relationship between the NPJ and fire holds true in the 21 st century.   By documenting the relationship between the NPJ and wildfires, this project will enable fire managers to better forecast future fire conditions, based on projected trends in the NPJ. Improving forecasting ability is critical to successful fire preparedness and accurate anticipation of fire suppression budgets.

This connection needs to be explained for locally-experienced weather and particularly for daily extreme events, whose seasonal behavior impacts both resources and imagination. Conversely, it is also important to assess the impact of long-term climate change on natural variability affecting the Southwest. The research team will focus on such assessments and clarify impacts of natural climate variability on the frequencies and intensities of specific extreme temperature and precipitation events as well as their cascading influences on streamflow in the changing climate of the Southwest. Results are meant to clarify the roles of natural influences on varying magnitude and rate of climate change over space and time, thus increasing stakeholders\u2019 awareness of certainty versus uncertainty about the future and facilitating better informed decisions on various timescales.

This project sought to identify the types of environmental information that resource managers in the Southwest need to make climate-related management decisions. To meet this goal, researchers first assessed the degree to which resource managers view climate information as relevant to the decisions they make. Next, they identified the types of decisions in which climate information has proven to be the most useful for managers. Finally, researchers identified best practices for coordinating science needs between resource managers and climate scientists, and for transferring relevant climate information to decision-makers. Together, these results can improve communication between stakeholders and scientists and ensure that managers receive the climate information they need to make effective resource management decisions in the face of climate change.

These fires were associated with extreme winds and were potentially also influenced by unusually dry conditions during several years leading up to the 2017 events. This fire season brought additional attention and emphasized the vital need for managers in the western U.S. to have access to scientific information on when and where to expect dangerous fire events. Understanding the multiple factors that cause extreme wildfire events is critical to short and long-term forecasting and planning. Seasonal climate measures such as temperature and precipitation are commonly used to explain fire occurrence and impact. However, weather events that produce extreme winds and severe temperatures over short periods of time can also have substantial impacts on fire behavior. In addition, multi-year droughts may increase fire potential by decreasing the amount of moisture in vegetation.   The goal of this project is to investigate the range of factors that may explain the variation in annual fire activity in both forested and non-forested landscapes in California. These factors will include the longer-term effects of extended droughts and the shorter-term effects of intense heat spells, low relative humidity, and extreme winds. In addition, researchers will evaluate the extent to which large fires are associated with particular fire ignition sources. Results should inform improved predictive models to show how long-term drought events and short-term extreme weather could impact future fire activity.   This project will evaluate the relative importance of these environmental factors over the last several decades, across different landscape types in California. Results will provide predictive tools for fire managers, enabling them to better anticipate extreme fire events and update fire-danger warnings. In the long-term, these results can also be used to inform efforts to understand possible changes in the probability of fire in California."}, {"node": 47, "name": "Improving and Accelerating the Application of Science to Natural Resource Management in California", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2018", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b58df15e4b0610d7f4bdbc1", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "California - one of the nation's most populous states - hosts extensive public lands, crown-jewel national parks, and diverse natural resources.

Recent advances have helped grow the body of literature surrounding phenology. We now know, for example, that invasive species often show greater flexibility in the timing of their phenological events, enabling them to outcompete native species as climate and environmental conditions change.  Natural resource managers recognize that changes in phenology can substantially affect their management activities. Phenological information can be used to identify when to survey for or treat invasive insects or plants, when to apply prescribed fire to maintain habitat, or when to prepare for peak tourist seasons in national parks. However, managers on-the-ground are often uncertain about how to best incorporate this information into their management practices.  With a focus on the Southwest U.S., this project will connect scientists and natural resource managers to ensure that managers are getting the right phenological information, in the right format, at the right time. Through a series of workshops, scientists with the USA National Phenology Network, the USGS, and universities will connect with resource managers from federal and state land management agencies, tribes, and private landholders to identify key decisions that would immediately benefit from phenological information. Through this engagement process, targeted products will be developed to address stakeholder-identified needs. Such products might include maps projecting green up of invasive plant species, such as buffelgrass, to inform the timing of the application of control treatments.

Found in eleven western states, this important yet fragile ecosystem is dominated by sagebrush, but also contains a diversity of native shrubs, grasses, and flowering plants. It provides critical habitat for wildlife like pronghorn and threatened species such as the greater sage-grouse, and is grazed by livestock on public and private lands. However, this landscape is increasingly threatened by shifts in wildfire patterns, the spread of invasive grasses, and changing climate conditions. While sagebrush is slow to recover after fires, non-native grasses such as cheatgrass thrive in post-fire conditions and the spread of these species can increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires. These changes to the sagebrush ecosystems have implications for big game, threatened wildlife, and ranching.  To address this growing concern, resource managers will often try to limit the spread of exotic grasses after fire events by applying herbicides, or will help native species recover through seeding or planting. However, these treatments have mixed results, and poor success is often attributed to droughts, which make it more difficult for seeds and native plants to survive; to the limited amount of time in which these treatments can be applied (usually in the first year after a fire); or because the seeds or plants used aren\u2019t adapted to the environmental conditions of the location where they\u2019re applied.  The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the factors that affect post-fire treatment success. Researchers will use data collected from more than 300 fires over the last 40 years, after which treatments were applied. They will identify the impacts of drought on those treatments, how incorporating information on drought forecasts or extending the period over which treatments are applied could have altered the outcomes, and how managers can better select plant material that will be more adaptable to the conditions of planting locations. Addressing this knowledge gap has been identified as a high priority in the DOI Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy, by the BLM Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation Program, and by state management agencies in the West.

These droughts also stress vegetation, which can make it more difficult for forests to recover after fire. Forest regeneration in burned areas may be limited because seeds have to travel long distances to recolonize, and when they do arrive, conditions are often unfavorably hot and dry. Conifer forests in the region have demonstrated particular difficulty in recovering after fires, and in some cases have transformed into other ecosystem types, such as deciduous-dominated forests or grasslands. Such ecological transformations have implications not only for the plants and animals that depend on conifer forests for habitat, but also for the services that these forests provide humans.  Managers can support forest regeneration by planting tree seeds and seedlings, but effective response requires information on when and where such interventions would best be implemented. Focusing on conifer forests in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada mountains, this project aims to develop a tool that can support managers in planning for post-fire recovery activities. By exploring different scenarios of seed availability and short-term climate conditions, forecast maps will be developed that demonstrate potential forest regeneration patterns under wet or dry post-fire conditions and low or high seed input potential. Using this information, researchers will identify locations that could be particularly challenged to recover post-fire, and would be good candidates for seeding or planting efforts.

In the face of a changing climate, it is important that resource managers understand how factors such as changing temperatures and precipitation will affect this vital water source.  To address this need, researchers are examining records of streamflow, temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation in the upper Colorado River basin going back more than 100 years, to see how these variables have changed during periods of low flow and drought. Next, researchers will analyze tree rings to reconstruct climatic conditions over the past 1,000 years to see if more recent droughts differ from historical climate patterns. This information will help researchers determine if droughts are lasting longer or are more severe than historical droughts, improving our understanding of the impacts of climate change in the region.

In the Southwest, more frequent and intense storms may negatively affect protected species in coastal salt marshes; changes in the timing and amount of precipitation could lead to increases in fuel loads; and increasingly humid heat waves could lead to higher incidence of heat-related illness among visitors to national parks.   This project will improve understanding of climate extremes and their potential effects in the Southwest. Researchers will assess a suite of models that project future global climate and determine which of those models best represent climate patterns and extremes in the Southwest. Researchers will then downscale the best models, a process that allows the models to be used for regional analyses, and will project past and future extreme temperature and precipitation. The downscaled climate data will be fed into a hydrologic model, the results of which can be used to assess future water availability and the probability of floods and droughts. Additionally, data on projected regional climate and climate extremes will be made available through an online interactive platform.   This project will advance scientific capacity to project climate extremes in the Southwest. The results will provide more-accurate estimates of future climate, which will inform management of natural resources and preparation of human communities for extreme conditions.

While rising temperatures can create drought conditions that favor severe fires, it is also possible that drought limits the ability of trees to survive a fire. During a drought, there is less water available for trees and more outbreaks of harmful insects and pathogens can occur, both of which can weaken trees. Tree mortality is one means of measuring the severity of a fire, and evidence shows that trees exposed to drought conditions for periods of 5-10 years are already more sensitive to the effects of fire \u2013 suggesting that drought could indeed increase fire severity.   This project will examine the poorly understood relationship between drought, fire, and tree mortality in the Southwest. Researchers will use existing data on controlled burns, tree-ring analysis, and detailed climate data to determine how these variables interact. Understanding how drought and fire might work together to cause tree death is critical. More dead trees translates into poorer habitat for wildlife, increased soil erosion, and greater carbon emissions following fires \u2013 which could worsen warming trends.   The warming experienced so far in the Southwest is small compared to expected future conditions, making this analysis critical for the success of long-term forest conservation. Identifying exactly how drought and fire interact to impact trees can help forest managers better understand and plan for the effects of fire in the future.

These changes have implications for the phenology, or the timing of natural life events (e.g. the timing of plant flowering in Spring or leaves falling in Autumn), of many plant species. However, not all species and regions are changing at the same rate, which can lead to mismatches (e.g. between the emergence of plants and pollinators in early spring). Many interactions in nature depend on timing and, as such, phenology affects nearly all aspects of the environment, including the abundance, distribution, and diversity of organisms, ecosystem services, food webs, even global water and carbon cycles.   Phenology is among the best indicators of climate change impacts, in large part because phenological events are some of the most sensitive biological responses to environmental changes. Researchers are rapidly developing datasets, models, and indices that can improve our understanding of changing phenology. However, most indices of phenological change are poorly suited for water-limited ecosystems, and existing models are lacking in their ability to represent phenological change at local scales that are relevant and useful for decision making.   This project is a step towards addressing these limitations. The project team aims to use local phenology data and climate information to build new phenology indices and models for the southwestern U.S. that address several significant information gaps, with a specific focus on creating useful and relevant data products and decision-support tools for managers. These models will be used to evaluate variations in historical phenology trends based on time period, plant type, geography, and moisture availability. The team plans to generate a phenology tool that resource managers in the Southwest can use to predict phenology events (e.g. plant green-up) based on a specified climate (historical, future near-term, and long-term). This work will help to ensure that phenological information can be used to inform conservation planning and resource management decisions in the Southwest.

To remedy this serious knowledge gap, project researchers are examining the causes, effects, and forecastability of snow drought to provide needed scientific information and guidance to planners and decision makers.   The central goals of this proposal are to better quantify the impact of snow droughts on municipal and ecosystem water supplies and improve the scientific information accessible to a wide range of resource managers. The project consists of three primary objectives: 1) Document the types, frequencies, and proximate causes of historical snow drought using snow and climate observations, 2) Assess streamflow forecasting abilities following snow drought using the operational regression-based forecasts used by water management agencies, and 3) Identify areas where streamflow forecast skill is improved by incorporating snow drought information.   Preliminary analyses indicate that several different types of snow droughts occur in the Southwest, arising from a variety of different factors. \u201cDry snow drought\u201d is caused by a lack of winter precipitation needed to accumulate snow. \u201cWarm snow drought\u201d can be caused by early snowmelt or by precipitation falling as rain rather than snow.

The overarching goals of this project are to better understand the influence of temperature on Colorado River streamflow, particularly during droughts, and assist water managers in planning for future droughts. This work expands on a recently completed study, building on that project in two main ways. First, this project extends collaborative work between scientists and Colorado River basin water managers to investigate the range of potential drought conditions under early 21st century warming, using both recent and historical data.

This project sought to assess the vulnerability of forests in the southwestern U.S. to climate change and wildfire, in order to understand how these ecosystems might become altered as a result. Researchers will examine (a) how climate change will impact wildfires in the region, to better understand fire risk; (b) identify where and when vegetation will be most sensitive to changing climate and fire conditions; and (c) determine the ability of vegetation to adapt to changing conditions, given appropriate management. Researchers will then work closely with public land managers to develop strategic management plans that enable forests to adapt to the changes that are occurring.   The results of this project are expected to inform strategic management decisions regarding wildfire control on public lands. By identifying the current and future vulnerability of forests to changes in climate and wildfires, this project will support managers in prioritizing areas for proactive fire management in the face of uncertainty. This information may enable managers to more efficiently allocate resources to fire management by targeting areas that are most vulnerable, such as forests with high fuel loads.

Through this project, researchers sought to better understand the climate change threats facing the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of northwestern Nevada. Researchers found that the Tribe\u2019s vulnerability to climate change stems from its dependence on Pyramid Lake, which may experience reduced water supply in the future. This will potentially have negative consequences for the endangered cui-ui fish, which is an important food and income source for the Tribe. At the same time, the Tribe is limited in its current ability to respond to climate impacts because of few economic opportunities and dwindling federal support.

The goal of this project was to assist land and wildlife managers in anticipating which species are most vulnerable to changes in climate in the Southwest, and how resources can best be invested to facilitate adaptation. Researchers evaluated the current and future breeding ranges of 15 bird and 16 reptile species in the western U.S. using a new approach that models variables such as temperature and precipition, terrain ruggedness and soil type, and plants that are commonly associated with each species.   Results showed that two-thirds of the species examined could be expected to experience a decrease in range, while one-third could experience an increase. Climate variables were found to play a bigger role than landscape or plant variables in determining changes in species range. Researchers also found that as available habitat patches for birds and reptiles become more isolated, their ranges also contract. This finding suggests that strategic management actions focused on conserving and restoring connections between habitat patches could help lessen the severity of the projected range contractions.

Reduced precipitation can also lead to lower water levels in streams and losses in the vegetation that grows alongside riverbanks.   The goal of this project was to identify how hydrologic systems in the Southwest might respond to changes in climate and the degree to which this response is dependent on the characteristics of the hydrologic system. To do this, researchers developed a tool that simulates how quickly water moves from the surface to underground aquifers.  The tool helps identify timeframes and regions where seepage of water into aquifers is likely constant, rather than fluctuating with rainfall patterns or climate. By locating these areas upfront, researchers can exclude them from their analysis and focus water supply forecasting efforts on areas where groundwater is more likely to be affected by changes in rainfall or human uses at the surface.   The model shows that areas with a shallower water table tend to have more variability in the rate at which groundwater supplies are replenished, with secondary effects related to the soil type and the period of variation. In these areas, changes in rainfall and water withdrawal for irrigation or urban use have a bigger impact on groundwater availability. Water resource managers can use this tool to more accurately forecast how much groundwater remains in different watersheds and to determine which systems will be most sensitive to changes in climate and water use. The need for better forecasting is only increasing, as aquifers are increasingly tapped and precipitation patterns are expected to become more variable.

Urban centers, agricultural operations, and the environment all compete for limited water, and demand is expected to only increase as the population grows and agriculture intensifies. At the same time, the water supply is projected to decrease as temperatures rise, precipitation patterns change, and the frequency of extreme droughts increases.   The Central Valley also provides critical wetland habitats to migratory waterbirds, and wetland managers require information on how to best use water resources to support wildlife objectives, particularly during drought. This project seeks to evaluate how drought influences the distribution, abundance, and timing of wetland habitat in the Central Valley. This information will then be used to assess the effects of drought on habitat and food availability for waterbirds, and subsequently, waterbird movements.   There is currently a lack of available data on wetland habitat in the Central Valley, as well as on how waterbird movements are influenced by habitat availability. Using near real-time tracking of waterbird habitats and movements, this study will address both of these needs and will enable researchers to identify gaps in habitat availability and food resources for waterbirds that occur as a result of drought. The results of this study will provide critical guidance for managers seeking to efficiently allocate limited water resources and provide the best possible habitat for waterbirds in the Central Valley, even during drought.

Hydrologic and ecological processes, such as groundwater fluctuations and riparian evapotranspiration, can be tightly coupled. Ideally, managers would have tools and models that include all processes to better understand how each management action would propagate through the environment. Because resources are limited, management tools that include only the most important processes may be more realistic. However, in some cases, omitting some interactions can lead to significant errors in predictions of hydrologic outcomes and ecological function, severely limiting a manager\u2019s ability to identify how restoration and conservation actions may make a system more resilient. Our goal is to develop a metric of hydrologic feedback strength for weighing the impact of conservation and restoration actions. We use modeling and feedbacks to quantify how hydrologic processes or restoration can amplify or absorb the effects of climate variability on riparian systems. Our framework also allows scientists to assess which processes are critical for hydrologic models to predict response to climate change. Using these index values, managers can predict which processes will amplify or absorb the potential effects of variable climate, climatic change, and proposed restoration actions.

The region depends on winter rain and snow to replenish the river basins\u2019 water supply. Atmospheric rivers \u2013 long, narrow channels in the atmosphere that carry water vapor from the Pacific Ocean \u2013 supply a substantial portion of this winter precipitation. While atmospheric rivers are critical for maintaining water resources and preventing drought, they occasionally cause extreme storms that lead to flooding. Scientists project that climate change will affect the intensity and frequency of atmospheric rivers in the Southwest, but little is known about what these changes will entail. This project will use modeling and observations to assess how climate change will affect water resources and the occurrence of floods in the Salt and Verde river basins through changes to atmospheric rivers. These projections will enable natural resource managers, water managers, and tribes in the region to plan for upcoming periods of extremely intense rainfall within the next decade.

Native Americans have a deep connection to the natural environment within which their livelihoods, cultural identity, and spiritual practices are rooted. Changes to water flow and hydrology, landscapes, and ecosystems, in combination with socio-economic and other factors, amplify tribal vulnerabilities to climate change. In the Southwest, tribes are already experiencing a range of impacts that are at least partially related to climate change. They include serious water quality and supply issues in the context of prolonged drought; reduced ability to grow or collect important traditional crops and raw materials; loss of forest resources from large and landscape-transforming wildfires exacerbated by drought, aridity, and insect infestations; and health impacts from heat waves, dust storms, and smoke from wildfires.  The Southwest Climate Science Center is partnering with the University of Arizona Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions (CCASS) to leverage previously existing and newly developing tribal engagement capacity within CCASS and to help identify emergent opportunities to support tribes in adapting to climate change. Through this project, CCASS is conducting a preliminary assessment of tribal interest and capacity for adaptation across the Southwest via interviews with selected tribal leaders and resource managers. In November 2015, CCASS also partnered with the Desert Landscape Conservation Cooperative to hold a meeting with tribal members that focused on successful tribal climate adaptation plans, lessons learned, traditional ecological knowledge, and tribal adaptation activities across the U.S. The CCASS project team is also developing a set of products to help tribes use \u201cscenario planning\u201d in their climate adaptation plans, allowing the tribes to consider different possible future scenarios in a changing climate.

Low rainfall and record high temperatures resulted in increased tree mortality and complete forest diebacks across the West. Though land managers scrambled to respond, they lacked information needed to make informed decisions. Focusing on California\u2019s central and southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, this project seeks to determine whether a key forest management practice \u2013 forest thinning via prescribed fire \u2013 can help forests better survive drought.   Prescribed fire is commonly used in the western U.S. to remove potential wildfire fuel, such as small trees and shrubs. It is also thought that this act of selectively removing trees helps remaining trees better survive drought events, because there is less competition for water. However, this proposition has never been formally tested. This project aims to identify whether current prescribed burning practices are sufficient to help forests survive drought, or whether these practices need to be implemented more intensively to meet this goal under increasingly frequent drought.   This project will answer questions at the forefront of research needs across federal land management agencies in California. Results will (1) help National Park Service staff make planning decisions to preserve giant sequoias at Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks; (2) help fire managers at the parks identify the effectiveness of different fire treatments and whether prescribed burning should be implemented as a drought resistance strategy; and (3) inform strategic planning efforts of the U.S. Forest Service on where and how much to thin forest stands, as well as inform plans for restoring landscapes impacted by major wildfires.   Droughts are expected to become more frequent and severe in the coming decades across the Southwest. This project will enable managers to make cost-benefit analyses of dollars spent using prescribed fire and determine whether this method can be used to prepare forests for a warmer and drier future.

Essentially, the ways in which researchers and resource managers collaborate can affect the use of scientific information in decision-making. Previous research has shown that relatively more collaboration between researchers and resource managers (or even the general public) tends to lead to more and more effective use of new scientific information. However, we do not yet have good ways to evaluate these research processes or the outcomes we expect them to produce.  This project will assess the key variables necessary for the successful production of usable climate information. To do so, researchers will evaluate the collaborative science approach currently being implemented in a project on managing forests for drought in California. Researchers will interview the project\u2019s scientists about their goals and stakeholder engagement approaches; observe meetings between scientists and managers; interview both scientists and managers at the conclusion of the project to identify the level of satisfaction with the approach used; and interview managers six months later to follow-up on how the information was actually used in decision-making.   The results of this project will help inform best practices for scientists to engage stakeholders during the research process.

Climate change will likely alter rainfall timing and intensity, but global climate models cannot capture the fine-scale dynamics of local rainfall, making future rainfall predictions for the islands uncertain.

Results suggest that Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s climate will become drier overall in the second half of the century, but this effect will vary considerably across the islands and by season. There may be an increasing contrast between wet and dry regions on each island, as wet areas become wetter and dry areas become drier.

Once it reaches the ground, rain can either run off and contribute to water flow in streams, or it can infiltrate into the ground and provide water for plants and recharge aquifers and groundwater. The exact route that water takes is controlled by many factors, including the duration and intensity of rainfall, the topography of the land, soil properties, and vegetation.   The introduction and spread of invasive plants and animals in Hawaiian forests, which alters the water-use and soil characteristics of ecosystems, can have large impacts on downstream water users. Increased demand and competition for limited water resources in Hawai\u02bbi has underscored the need for a better understanding of this relationship; however, relevant statewide data is currently lacking.   The objective of this project is to understand how expanding invasive plant populations and changing rainfall patterns will impact water resources in the future. Project researchers are exploring the differences in key soil characteristics that control runoff and groundwater recharge in managed and relatively intact native mesic (moderate amounts of water) and wet forests and in similar invasive-dominated forests. Primary soil characteristics of interest are the hydraulic conductivity of soils (ability of water to move through soils) and soil hydrophobicity (a property that causes water to collect on the surface rather than infiltrating into the ground). Data will also be collected on the canopy and understory composition in the forests and on disturbances by invasive animals, like feral pigs.

In many parts of the world, this decrease in temperature is a limiting factor for vegetation\u2014at certain elevations, the temperature becomes too cold for plants to survive. However in the tropics, moisture availability may play a more important role than temperature in determining the altitude at which forests can grow. For example on Haleakal\u0101, a volcano on the Hawaiian Island of Maui, the forest line is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. Rather, the forest line is highest in the wetter eastern-most end and lower on the drier, western end of the volcano.   Research also suggests that short-duration extreme climate events that cause changes in moisture, such as El Ni\u00f1o, can control the upper limit of forests more than long-term average climate does. This is because species found at the forest line are often already near their physiological limits, so extreme changes can have a big effect on their survival.    A strong El Ni\u00f1o occurred in Hawai\u2019i in 2015 and provided researchers with a unique opportunity to observe how vegetation responds to ensuing climate variability. Researchers are focusing on Metrosideros polymorpha, a species of flowering evergreen native to Hawai\u2019i. This species is the dominant canopy tree found near the forest line and will be used as an indicator for how the forest line responds to El Ni\u00f1o-driven drought.

Conifer forests in the region have demonstrated particular difficulty in recovering after fires, and in some cases have transformed into other ecosystem types, such as deciduous-dominated forests or grasslands. Such ecological transformations have implications not only for the plants and animals that depend on conifer forests for habitat, but also for the services that these forests provide humans.

In November 2015, CCASS also partnered with the Desert Landscape Conservation Cooperative to hold a meeting with tribal members that focused on successful tribal climate adaptation plans, lessons learned, traditional ecological knowledge, and tribal adaptation activities across the U.S. The CCASS project team is also developing a set of products to help tribes use \u201cscenario planning\u201d in their climate adaptation plans, allowing the tribes to consider different possible future scenarios in a changing climate.  This partnership is being continued in 2016 through the project: Continued Partnerships to Increase Tribal Capacity for Climate Change Adaptation Planning   ", "items": {}}, {"num_items": 0, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5012a99be4b05140039e02e5", "node": 51, "name": "Climate Change Vulnerability of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe in the Southwest", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": " Native Americans are one of the most vulnerable populations to climate change in the United States because of their reliance upon the natural environment for food, livelihood, and cultural traditions.

This will potentially have negative consequences for the endangered cui-ui fish, which is an important food and income source for the Tribe. At the same time, the Tribe is limited in its current ability to respond to climate impacts because of few economic opportunities and dwindling federal support.

Warming temperatures, clearly documented in climate records for the Colorado River basin, are having an impact on the amount of annual streamflow yielded from rain and snow. Recent work has revealed that warming temperatures have played an increasingly important role over the past decades, both exacerbating droughts and dampening the effects of wet winters on high stream flows. Understanding and anticipating how warming temperatures will influence future water supply in the Colorado River basin is increasingly important for resource management, particularly in light of recent drought conditions.   The overarching goals of this project are to better understand the influence of temperature on Colorado River streamflow, particularly during droughts, and assist water managers in planning for future droughts. This work expands on a recently completed study, building on that project in two main ways. First, this project extends collaborative work between scientists and Colorado River basin water managers to investigate the range of potential drought conditions under early 21st century warming, using both recent and historical data. For example, with precipitation reconstructions from tree rings for the past 500 years, the team can use a simple hydrologic model to assess the impacts of the longest and most severe droughts of the past on the Colorado River under today\u2019s warmer temperatures. With this information, the project team will contribute to a set of plausible scenarios of future drought that planners can use to help make resource-management decisions. Second, the project is more explicitly examining the drivers of Colorado River drought, with a focus on factors such as the phase of precipitation (rain vs. snow), the timing and rate of snowmelt, and evaporation rates. The project team will also begin to explore the ways that changing temperatures and streamflow might impact the ecological health of the upper Colorado River basin.", "items": {}}, {"num_items": 0, "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5012a20de4b05140039e02c6", "node": 54, "name": "Using Climate and Water Models to Examine Future Water Availability and Biodiversity in California and the Great Basin", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "As the predicted impacts of climate change are becoming more apparent, natural resource managers are faced with the task of developing climate adaptation plans.

Reduced precipitation can also lead to lower water levels in streams and losses in the vegetation that grows alongside riverbanks.   The goal of this project was to identify how hydrologic systems in the Southwest might respond to changes in climate and the degree to which this response is dependent on the characteristics of the hydrologic system. To do this, researchers developed a tool that simulates how quickly water moves from the surface to underground aquifers.  The tool helps identify timeframes and regions where seepage of water into aquifers is likely constant, rather than fluctuating with rainfall patterns or climate. By locating these areas upfront, researchers can exclude them from their analysis and focus water supply forecasting efforts on areas where groundwater is more likely to be affected by changes in rainfall or human uses at the surface.   The model shows that areas with a shallower water table tend to have more variability in the rate at which groundwater supplies are replenished, with secondary effects related to the soil type and the period of variation. In these areas, changes in rainfall and water withdrawal for irrigation or urban use have a bigger impact on groundwater availability. Water resource managers can use this tool to more accurately forecast how much groundwater remains in different watersheds and to determine which systems will be most sensitive to changes in climate and water use. The need for better forecasting is only increasing, as aquifers are increasingly tapped and precipitation patterns are expected to become more variable.

These invasions often cause management agencies to incur high costs for prevention, control, restoration, and fire responses.   Control and prevention of invasive species is challenging because the risk of invasive plants becoming abundant depends on existing plant communities, climate and weather, land use, and fire history. Moreover, scientific information on invasion risk that does exist has not always been translated into maps that planners and resource managers can use in their decision making. Broad-scale information is needed to link geographic variation in climate and disturbances (e.g. fire) to decisions on the ground regarding where to apply treatments aimed at limiting the impacts of invasions and restoring native plant composition.

Assessing and addressing the information needs of federal, state, and tribal resource managers is a critical part of helping these decision-makers manage risk and adapt to these changes. Identification and evaluation of existing barriers and opportunities for knowledge exchange between scientists and managers within the region is an important step toward building effective adaptation networks. This requires knowledge sharing at a level that has not previously existed, particularly in the Interior Southwest.  To help close these existing information gaps, this project aims to develop and conduct the next generation of scientific assessments that will improve the ability of natural resource managers to use critical scientific information for climate adaptation. The main focal areas of the project include providing 1) recommendations for best practices for integrating science into natural resource management, 2) the information needed to allow managers to prepare in advance for extreme events, and 3) enhanced opportunities for knowledge exchange between scientists and managers. The Southwest CASC is partnering with the Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions at the University of Arizona to organize a working group of scientists and resource managers that will design and implement a regional adaptation and science assessment network. Once established, this network will work to synthesize existing knowledge and evaluate information needs on priority management topics.

It provides critical habitat for wildlife like pronghorn and threatened species such as the greater sage-grouse, and is grazed by livestock on public and private lands. However, this landscape is increasingly threatened by shifts in wildfire patterns, the spread of invasive grasses, and changing climate conditions. While sagebrush is slow to recover after fires, non-native grasses such as cheatgrass thrive in post-fire conditions and the spread of these species can increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires.

To address this growing concern, resource managers will often try to limit the spread of exotic grasses after fire events by applying herbicides, or will help native species recover through seeding or planting. However, these treatments have mixed results, and poor success is often attributed to droughts, which make it more difficult for seeds and native plants to survive; to the limited amount of time in which these treatments can be applied (usually in the first year after a fire); or because the seeds or plants used aren\u2019t adapted to the environmental conditions of the location where they\u2019re applied.

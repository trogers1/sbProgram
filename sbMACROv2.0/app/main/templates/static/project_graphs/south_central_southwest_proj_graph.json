Ideally, the model output will match the climate conditions that were actually recorded in the past, indicating that the model correctly characterizes how the climate system works and can be used to reliably project future conditions. However, this approach assumes that models that reliably project past climate conditions will accurately predict future climate conditions, even though the climate system might have changed.    This research contributes to generating more reliable local-scale climate projections by testing the assumption that the climatological relationships which existed in the past will continue to exist in the future. To do this, researchers developed a novel approach in which very high-resolution climate model data were used as a surrogate for historical and future \"observations\", allowing researchers to test how well the more commonly-used coarse-scale global climate models project future climate conditions.  Findings suggest that the assumption holds reasonably well in many cases, but there are some instances (for example in particular geographic locations, such as coastal regions, and at certain times of year, especially summer) when the assumption is not as robust. This research also explores the conditions under which the assumption does not hold, and develops ways to make the methods used to generate local information about climate change more reliable. The results of this research can improve the reliability of the climate models used by resource managers to inform vulnerability assessments, adaptation planning, and other important climate-related decisions.

Snowmelt runoff is therefore an important component of water supply outlooks for the region, which are used by a variety of stakeholders to anticipate water availability in the springtime.   It is critical that these water supply outlooks be as accurate as possible. Errors can cost states millions of dollars due to mis-allocation of water and lost agricultural productivity. There is a perception that runoff forecast accuracy has declined over the last several decades in Colorado and New Mexico, making water supply outlooks less reliable. Declines in accuracy could be related to changes in climate and land cover; however, potential sources of error have not yet been examined in the upper Rio Grande basin.

For example, are the methods used to characterize the severity of drought \u2013 known as drought indices \u2013 effective tools for predicting the actual damage felt by communities?   As droughts continue to increase in frequency and severity, the need to understand community vulnerability and resilience to drought is only growing. Focusing on New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, this study sought to answer several key questions. First, researchers examined whether existing drought indices are effective in predicting the occurrence of drought events and their actual damages. Second, researchers explored why some communities suffer less damage from drought and recover faster than others. Finally, researchers identified strategies for encouraging the adoption of water conservation behaviors among residents. So far, results show that drought indices are overall useful tools for predicting drought damage and that a community\u2019s resilience to drought is often tied to socioeconomic conditions.

The objective of this project was to determine how species and ecosystems associated with karst might respond to future temperature and precipitation extremes and accompanying changes in groundwater levels and springflow. The research focused on 16 species in the Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas and eight species in the Madison aquifer in western South Dakota. Researchers linked global climate models, regional climate models, and hydrologic models to determine how future springflow might be impacted by changes in temperature and precipitation. By combining information about future hydrology with what we know about species needs, researchers determined the vulnerability of the selected species to climate extremes.  Researchers found that more species in the Edwards aquifer are vulnerable to climate extremes than in the Madison aquifer, due in part to the more severe hydrologic changes that the Edwards aquifer is expected to undergo.

To better understand these links, project researchers implemented two computer-based numeric models in the Cleve Creek watershed in the Schell Creek Range, east of Ely, Nevada. The application of the two models to study the hydrologic and ecological processes in the watershed allows us to look forward in time over a range of possible scenarios to predict future water availability under simulated climate variability. Ultimately, the models can provide an array of outcomes that can help water resource managers identify threats and opportunities posed by climate variations during the next thirty years.

These droughts also stress vegetation, which can make it more difficult for forests to recover after fire. Forest regeneration in burned areas may be limited because seeds have to travel long distances to recolonize, and when they do arrive, conditions are often unfavorably hot and dry. Conifer forests in the region have demonstrated particular difficulty in recovering after fires, and in some cases have transformed into other ecosystem types, such as deciduous-dominated forests or grasslands. Such ecological transformations have implications not only for the plants and animals that depend on conifer forests for habitat, but also for the services that these forests provide humans.  Managers can support forest regeneration by planting tree seeds and seedlings, but effective response requires information on when and where such interventions would best be implemented. Focusing on conifer forests in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada mountains, this project aims to develop a tool that can support managers in planning for post-fire recovery activities. By exploring different scenarios of seed availability and short-term climate conditions, forecast maps will be developed that demonstrate potential forest regeneration patterns under wet or dry post-fire conditions and low or high seed input potential. Using this information, researchers will identify locations that could be particularly challenged to recover post-fire, and would be good candidates for seeding or planting efforts.

Recent advances have helped grow the body of literature surrounding phenology. We now know, for example, that invasive species often show greater flexibility in the timing of their phenological events, enabling them to outcompete native species as climate and environmental conditions change.  Natural resource managers recognize that changes in phenology can substantially affect their management activities. Phenological information can be used to identify when to survey for or treat invasive insects or plants, when to apply prescribed fire to maintain habitat, or when to prepare for peak tourist seasons in national parks. However, managers on-the-ground are often uncertain about how to best incorporate this information into their management practices.  With a focus on the Southwest U.S., this project will connect scientists and natural resource managers to ensure that managers are getting the right phenological information, in the right format, at the right time. Through a series of workshops, scientists with the USA National Phenology Network, the USGS, and universities will connect with resource managers from federal and state land management agencies, tribes, and private landholders to identify key decisions that would immediately benefit from phenological information.

To do this, researchers developed a tool that simulates how quickly water moves from the surface to underground aquifers.

By locating these areas upfront, researchers can exclude them from their analysis and focus water supply forecasting efforts on areas where groundwater is more likely to be affected by changes in rainfall or human uses at the surface.

These invasions often cause management agencies to incur high costs for prevention, control, restoration, and fire responses.   Control and prevention of invasive species is challenging because the risk of invasive plants becoming abundant depends on existing plant communities, climate and weather, land use, and fire history. Moreover, scientific information on invasion risk that does exist has not always been translated into maps that planners and resource managers can use in their decision making.

While rising temperatures can create drought conditions that favor severe fires, it is also possible that drought limits the ability of trees to survive a fire. During a drought, there is less water available for trees and more outbreaks of harmful insects and pathogens can occur, both of which can weaken trees. Tree mortality is one means of measuring the severity of a fire, and evidence shows that trees exposed to drought conditions for periods of 5-10 years are already more sensitive to the effects of fire \u2013 suggesting that drought could indeed increase fire severity.   This project will examine the poorly understood relationship between drought, fire, and tree mortality in the Southwest. Researchers will use existing data on controlled burns, tree-ring analysis, and detailed climate data to determine how these variables interact. Understanding how drought and fire might work together to cause tree death is critical. More dead trees translates into poorer habitat for wildlife, increased soil erosion, and greater carbon emissions following fires \u2013 which could worsen warming trends.   The warming experienced so far in the Southwest is small compared to expected future conditions, making this analysis critical for the success of long-term forest conservation. Identifying exactly how drought and fire interact to impact trees can help forest managers better understand and plan for the effects of fire in the future.

Warming temperatures in spring can reduce snow-fed flows, with serious implications for the water supplies that support communities and wildlife.

In the face of a changing climate, it is important that resource managers understand how factors such as changing temperatures and precipitation will affect this vital water source.  To address this need, researchers are examining records of streamflow, temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation in the upper Colorado River basin going back more than 100 years, to see how these variables have changed during periods of low flow and drought. Next, researchers will analyze tree rings to reconstruct climatic conditions over the past 1,000 years to see if more recent droughts differ from historical climate patterns. This information will help researchers determine if droughts are lasting longer or are more severe than historical droughts, improving our understanding of the impacts of climate change in the region.

These changes have implications for the phenology, or the timing of natural life events (e.g. the timing of plant flowering in Spring or leaves falling in Autumn), of many plant species. However, not all species and regions are changing at the same rate, which can lead to mismatches (e.g. between the emergence of plants and pollinators in early spring). Many interactions in nature depend on timing and, as such, phenology affects nearly all aspects of the environment, including the abundance, distribution, and diversity of organisms, ecosystem services, food webs, even global water and carbon cycles.   Phenology is among the best indicators of climate change impacts, in large part because phenological events are some of the most sensitive biological responses to environmental changes. Researchers are rapidly developing datasets, models, and indices that can improve our understanding of changing phenology. However, most indices of phenological change are poorly suited for water-limited ecosystems, and existing models are lacking in their ability to represent phenological change at local scales that are relevant and useful for decision making.   This project is a step towards addressing these limitations.

These models will be used to evaluate variations in historical phenology trends based on time period, plant type, geography, and moisture availability. The team plans to generate a phenology tool that resource managers in the Southwest can use to predict phenology events (e.g. plant green-up) based on a specified climate (historical, future near-term, and long-term).

In the Southwest, more frequent and intense storms may negatively affect protected species in coastal salt marshes; changes in the timing and amount of precipitation could lead to increases in fuel loads; and increasingly humid heat waves could lead to higher incidence of heat-related illness among visitors to national parks.   This project will improve understanding of climate extremes and their potential effects in the Southwest. Researchers will assess a suite of models that project future global climate and determine which of those models best represent climate patterns and extremes in the Southwest. Researchers will then downscale the best models, a process that allows the models to be used for regional analyses, and will project past and future extreme temperature and precipitation. The downscaled climate data will be fed into a hydrologic model, the results of which can be used to assess future water availability and the probability of floods and droughts. Additionally, data on projected regional climate and climate extremes will be made available through an online interactive platform.   This project will advance scientific capacity to project climate extremes in the Southwest. The results will provide more-accurate estimates of future climate, which will inform management of natural resources and preparation of human communities for extreme conditions.

These saltmarshes, mudflats, and shallow bays are not only critical for wildlife, but they also provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Today, sea-level rise, more frequent and stronger storms, saltwater intrusion, and warming water temperatures are among the threats that are altering these important habitats.   Much of the existing research on anticipating the effects of changing conditions on coastal ecosystems relies on global or regional scale data, meaning that the detailed information necessary for local-scale decision making is often not available. Building on data collected by previous Southwest CSC research, this project focuses on local-scale monitoring of coastal habitats in California to capture current trends and effects of storm events and inundation, and to inform more detailed projections of the impacts of future changes. Researchers are working closely with federal, state, and local management agencies throughout the process, from data collection to results sharing.    So far, results suggest that moderate to high rates of sea-level rise would result in a loss of coastal wetlands, with implications for the ecosystem services that these ecosystems provide \u2013 such as wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, improved water quality, and coastal protection from storms.

Yet the Colorado River\u2019s water supply is already fully allocated, meaning that the economic and environmental health of the region is closely tied to the river\u2019s streamflow.   Climate projections for the Southwest show a future marked by chronic drought and substantial reductions in streamflow. The region has already been impacted by climate change, experiencing warmer temperatures and more intense drought, particularly in late spring and early summer, resulting in reduced streamflow. In order to appropriately manage the Colorado River under changing conditions, water resource planners require reliable projections of future streamflow.   This project seeks to characterize how changing climate conditions affect cool and warm season precipitation in the Colorado River basin and the corresponding impacts on streamflow. Specifically, researchers will examine whether human-caused climate change interacts with natural variations in climate (such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation) intensify climate extremes, such as severe drought. Researchers will implement a new technique to downscale global climate model data, to produce more accurate streamflow projections that can be used to make local- and regional-scale water management decisions.

Found in eleven western states, this important yet fragile ecosystem is dominated by sagebrush, but also contains a diversity of native shrubs, grasses, and flowering plants. It provides critical habitat for wildlife like pronghorn and threatened species such as the greater sage-grouse, and is grazed by livestock on public and private lands. However, this landscape is increasingly threatened by shifts in wildfire patterns, the spread of invasive grasses, and changing climate conditions. While sagebrush is slow to recover after fires, non-native grasses such as cheatgrass thrive in post-fire conditions and the spread of these species can increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires. These changes to the sagebrush ecosystems have implications for big game, threatened wildlife, and ranching.  To address this growing concern, resource managers will often try to limit the spread of exotic grasses after fire events by applying herbicides, or will help native species recover through seeding or planting. However, these treatments have mixed results, and poor success is often attributed to droughts, which make it more difficult for seeds and native plants to survive; to the limited amount of time in which these treatments can be applied (usually in the first year after a fire); or because the seeds or plants used aren\u2019t adapted to the environmental conditions of the location where they\u2019re applied.  The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the factors that affect post-fire treatment success. Researchers will use data collected from more than 300 fires over the last 40 years, after which treatments were applied. They will identify the impacts of drought on those treatments, how incorporating information on drought forecasts or extending the period over which treatments are applied could have altered the outcomes, and how managers can better select plant material that will be more adaptable to the conditions of planting locations.

To remedy this serious knowledge gap, project researchers are examining the causes, effects, and forecastability of snow drought to provide needed scientific information and guidance to planners and decision makers.   The central goals of this proposal are to better quantify the impact of snow droughts on municipal and ecosystem water supplies and improve the scientific information accessible to a wide range of resource managers. The project consists of three primary objectives: 1) Document the types, frequencies, and proximate causes of historical snow drought using snow and climate observations, 2) Assess streamflow forecasting abilities following snow drought using the operational regression-based forecasts used by water management agencies, and 3) Identify areas where streamflow forecast skill is improved by incorporating snow drought information.

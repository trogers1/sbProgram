Natural resource managers and scientists in the Northeast, as well as the Northeast Refugia Research Coalition, coordinated by the Northeast CSC, recently identified vernal pools as a priority ecosystem to study, and recent revisions to State Wildlife Action Plans highlighted climate change and disease as primary threats to key vernal pool ecosystems. Mapping out the hydrology of vernal pools across the Northeast is an important step in informing land management and conservation decision-making.   Project researchers will collect hydrology data over the course of a year for 70 vernal pools. They will combine this information with existing data on vernal pool hydrology, targeted amphibian species (e.g., wood frogs and spotted salamanders), and the ranavirus and chytrid diseases that impact amphibians. This project will provide a preliminary assessment of the resistance of particular vernal pools to changes in climate by (1) modeling key aspects of vernal pool hydrology (inundated areas in spring, spring-to-summer changes in water cover etc.) based on climate and landscape drivers, and (2) relating vernal pool hydrology to amphibian occupancy and prevalence of disease.

The impacts of this warming on aquatic ecosystems are significant in many areas, causing problems for fisheries management, as many economically and ecologically important fish species are experiencing range shifts and population declines. Fisheries and natural resource managers need timely and usable data and tools in order to understand and predict changes to lakes and their biota.   A previous Northeast CSC-funded project modeled lake temperatures to help state agencies in the Midwest understand trends in walleye and largemouth bass populations and predict lake-specific fish populations under future climate scenarios. These results have been extremely valuable for decisions and management strategies at the state scale, and this new project will expand these efforts and will focus on lake temperature products at the three spatial scales of most interest to state agency stakeholders: lake, state, and region (for Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan).   The project researchers will use a \u201chyperscale\u201d modeling approach that will build upon the multi-state modeling framework developed in the earlier project to increase model accuracy for high priority managed lakes. This approach will use all observations of temperature that exist for every study lake in the region and use machine learning techniques to uncover biases in models used for lakes with many observations. The project will generate an improved assessment of aquatic habitat for lake fisheries, and will provide estimates of contemporary thermal habitats to be used by state partners to estimate the distribution and abundance of ecologically and economically important fish species. Deliverables for this project include: 1) hind-casted lake temperature profiles (1979-present), 2) summary outputs from the thermal models, and 3) individually tuned lake models for managers to use for testing and predicting future conditions under different climate change scenarios."}, {"node": 2, "name": "Development of the Wildlife Adaptation Menu for Resource Managers", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2017", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59de6101e4b05fe04ccd39b8", "num_items": 1, "items": {"5e98b56482ce172707f6aa86": {"title": "Final Report for Development of the Wildlife Adaptation Menu for Resource Managers", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e98b56482ce172707f6aa86"}}, "summary": "The Climate Change Response Framework is an example of a collaborative, cross-boundary approach to create a set of tools, partnerships, and actions to support climate-informed conservation and land management.

Not only do wildlife and resource managers need the best available science, it must also be presented in a usable format with feasible options within the purview of an individual manager.  The research team is first completing a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed studies to summarize what wildlife-related management actions currently exist in climate change adaptation. They will then develop and test a \u201cmenu\u201d of climate change adaptation actions that are suitable for wildlife management in terrestrial ecosystems. This Wildlife Adaptation Menu will be modeled off existing adaptation menus for Forestry and Urban Forestry, and it will be designed to be used in conjunction with the Adaptation Workbook. In addition to a menu of adaption strategies and approaches, the scientists will also identify site-level tactics and develop case studies demonstrating the use and implementation of the menu. To ensure that information and tools meet the needs of managers, the team is involving and integrating input from wildlife managers at every step of the process.

This study identified habitat and forest characteristics that improve the resiliency of forest dwelling amphibians and other wildlife to climate change. Further, by studying a foundational species in forest floor ecosystems, the scientists can use the information to make inferences about rare and declining species.  The researchers studied multiple red-backed salaamander populations across the range of the species, which primarily occurs in mature deciduous forests across the northeastern half of North America. They found evidence that salamanders will be negatively impacted by warmer temperatures and drier conditions, both in terms of how well they might survive but also in their ability to move around on the forest floor.

There are two general approaches of downscaling: dynamical and statistical. Within those, many dynamical models have been developed by different institutions, and there are a number of statistical algorithms that have been developed over the years. Many past studies have evaluated the performance of these two broad approaches of downscaling with respect to climate variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation), but few have translated these evaluations to ecological metrics that managers use to make decisions in planning for climate change. This study uses maple syrup production as a case study for evaluating how these two downscaling techniques perform in terms of projecting changes in the tapping season. Maple syrup producers are interested in how climate change will affect their industry. Our results will give them a sense of the range they can expect for different aspects of the tapping season (timing of tap date, length of season, quality of sap, etc.).

Most efforts to assess the likely impacts of climate change on biodiversity try to rank species based on their vulnerability under changed environmental conditions. These efforts have generally not considered the ability of organisms to adjust their phenotype to the changing environment. Organisms can do this by one of two ways. First, they can adjust their phenotype via non-evolutionary pathways. Second, they can undergo adaptive evolutionary change. We used two interconnected approaches to evaluate thermal adaptation capacity in a cold-water fish species. 1) Using tagging data, we estimated thermal performance curves for wild fish. The curves indicate how fish body growth will respond to changing temperatures. 2) Using genomic approaches, we developed a unified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel for use across the species\u2019 range to examine adaptive capacity. This panel can be used for high throughput genotyping of individuals to understand genetic diversity, health, and potential for thermal adaptation. Additionally, with the SNP panel we provide a valuable resource to the community of researchers working on Brook Trout conservation and management.  The SNP panel will make it possible for individual datasets collected across the range to be standardized so that they can be used to examine both local processes and range wide patterns. Overall, our results help us understand how Brook Trout will respond to a changing climate.

The scenarios serve both to identify climate change impacts unique to each participating Tribe and to propose solutions for adaptation and resiliency that are relevant for each scenario. The scenarios can be used as the basis for motivating more extensive Tribal adaptation plans, justifying future Tribal adaptation/mitigation projects, and creating the foundation for more sophisticated collaborations between Tribes, other parties and the Northeast Climate Science Center that harness robust risk analysis, decision tools and modeling. The scenarios, then, serve as the basis for characterizing climate change vulnerabilities and the needed capacities to address them.

Throughout this project, researchers engaged with state and federal resource managers, tribal groups, and other maple syrup producers to facilitate the adaptation of maple sugaring to climate change and aid in preserving this culturally and economically significant tradition in the Northeast and Midwest.

This project sought to provide an example of cooperative landscape decision-making by addressing the conservation of headwater stream ecosystems in the face of climate change at the watershed scale. Predictive models were built for critical resources to examine the effects of the potential alternative actions on the objectives, taking account of climate effects and examining whether there are key uncertainties that impede decision making. Results provide decision analyses that are (1) relevant to the management partners in question; (2) emblematic of landscape-scale cooperative decisions; and (3) sensitive to the practical consequences of climate change.  The successful application of structured decision making (SDM) requires the involvement of resource managers at each step in the decision. By involving federal, state, local and non-profit management organizations, the PIs ensure that the decision outcomes are suitable for all involved. Though they may identify a decision which is not optimal for each management organization, species group, or protected area of a given watershed individually, collectively results will be able to satisfy the regional objectives for headwater stream systems.

We predicted the distribution and abundance of common tree species across portions of the eastern U.S. under alternative climate scenarios that varied in the amount of warming by the end of the century from 1.1 to 4.2 degrees celsius. We used a forest landscape change model to forecast changes in tree abundances and distribution in the North Atlantic region of the U.S. while accounting for climate change, succession, and harvest. We then considered a broader region of the U.S. and combined our results with results from previous studies to compare forecasts from three different modeling approaches for the Central Hardwood, Central Appalachian, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regions to determine the level of agreement among models.  Our forecasts for the North Atlantic region indicated tree abundances were affected first by succession and harvest but second by climate. We predicted an increase in Southern and Central Hardwood species and a decrease in Northern Hardwood and spruce-fir forest species under warming climates over the next 300 years. Our comparison of the three modeling approaches across the eastern U.S. indicated high agreement for many species, especially northern species modeled to lose habitat in coming decades. There was agreement among models for decreases in black spruce, balsam fir, northern white cedar, and red spruce, and increases in loblolly pine and some oaks and hickories. Agreement across different modeling approaches and different climate scenarios provides strong evidence of potentially important changes to forests in response to climate change. These results can be used to guide decisions about how to manage forests under climate change to continue to provide the benefits we derive from them.

Extensive portions of prairie have already been lost due to agriculture and urbanization, and as a result grassland birds have declined more than any other bird group in the last four decades. Now, climate change could exacerbate existing threats to these birds as temperatures in certain prairie ecosystems are expected to rise and extreme weather events, such as drought, could become more common.  The goal of this project was to develop a framework to identify demographic sensitivities and assess the vulnerability of grassland bird species to future climate change. To do so, the researchers developed a strong partnership among managers and researchers to understand how climate change might impact the conservation and management planning of grassland birds throughout the Northeast CASC region and identify potentially vulnerable species. Using input from managers, the team focused their efforts on two grassland indicator species of high conservation interest: Henslow\u2019s Sparrows and Bobolinks. They developed spatially-explicit and temporally dynamic species distribution models for these indicator species and evaluated the effects of past and future climate on their populations. Finally, they studied how weather and extreme events (e.g., drought and flooding) effect the breeding success of grassland birds across North America.  By incorporating information on future climate change, the project team has identified regions where Henslow's Sparrows, a species of increasing conservation concern, are likely to face unsuitable conditions for reproduction. In addition, they have identified areas that will serve as likely refugia for this species in the future. The researchers have performed the first-ever exploration of the synergistic effects of weather and grassland patch size, the most common currency of grassland bird conservation and management. They have found that large grasslands serve as an important buffer of extreme temperature and precipitation on grassland bird nesting success.

This work capitalized on a rich suite of long-term data from these ecosystems to document recent trends in these forests and their associated bird species and developed tools for predicting their future abundance under climate change. Findings from this work indicate declining trends in the abundance of spruce-fir obligate birds, including Bicknell\u2019s Thrush, across the Lake States and New England. In contrast, montane spruce-fir forests in the White and Green Mountains of New England exhibited patterns of increasing abundance, potentially due to their recovery from the negative impacts of historic land use and pollution. Despite these recent trends, long-term predictions of future abundance for the dominant species found in spruce-fir forests (black, red, and white spruce and balsam fir) indicated large declines in these species from across much of the northeastern United States by the year 2090. Several areas were recognized where these forests might persist, including high elevation portions of New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont and in large portions of northwestern Maine. An understanding of these future dynamics is critical for informing and prioritizing conservation efforts aimed at protecting these ecosystems and associated wildlife species under future climate change and speak to the importance of sustaining long-term monitoring efforts to assist these decisions.

For example, plants might be relocated to support pollinator conservation or the restoration of prairies. Some land managers, in an effort to be proactive in the face of changing environmental conditions, are also considering relocating plants to sites that are considered more similar to anticipated future conditions. However, moving plants can be ecologically and economically risky. It\u2019s possible that pests, pathogens, or contaminant weeds can be inadvertently moved along with the target plant material. In 2016, the noxious weed Palmer amaranth was introduced to Minnesota as a contaminant in seed brought in to improve Monarch butterfly and pollinator habitat. This fast growing weed is capable of reducing soybean yields by 78% and corn yields by 91%, and requires costly resources to fight its spread.   One factor that impacts the risk associated with plant movement is the distance between the source of the plant and where it is being relocated to. If the source is located near the translocation site, it is less likely to be contaminated with new weeds or pathogens. The goal of this project is to create a framework for evaluating risk associated with the movement of plant material. The first tier of the framework will describe the future condition of the species, site, or community of concern, if plant movement is implemented and if it is not. The second tier will assess the ecological risks associated with moving plant material. This will include identifying potential pathogens, weeds, and pests that might be associated with plants from different areas and could be inadvertently introduced during translocation, and evaluating the potential harm these species might cause if introduced. The benefit of such a framework will be to greatly reduce the likelihood of unintended introductions of pests and noxious species. It will also take into account the ability of plants to adapt to expected future environmental conditions in their new locations. This work will support a range of stakeholders, including private, state, federal, and non-profit land managers who undertake planting for conservation or restoration.   Once the risk assessment framework is complete, researchers will test it for prairie restoration. This project will focus on the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota, but the results will also be broadly relevant to grassland managers in the central U.S."}, {"node": 25, "name": "Refugia are Important but are they Connected?

One specific management strategy is based on the idea that in certain locations, climate conditions will remain suitable for species to continue to inhabit into the future. These locations are known as climate \u201crefugia\u201d. In contrast, other locations may become too hot, dry, or wet for species to continue to inhabit. When wildlife managers are considering protecting land for vulnerable species, it can be helpful for them to understand where these climate refugia are located, so that they can be prioritized for conservation.   However, most tools used by resource managers to manage these important places identify the geographic locations of refugia, but do not examine how connected those locations are to other refugia or how accessible they are to current species distributions. This project aims to close this knowledge gap. The main objective of this project is to provide a map of projected refugia networks at the end of the century for each of 10 Species in Greatest Conservation Need in the northeastern U.S. A preliminary list of species includes Canada Lynx, Saltmarsh Sparrow, Spotted Turtle, Wood Turtle, Bicknell\u2019s Thrush, Moose, Prairie Warbler, Cerulean Warbler, Blackpoll Warbler, and Virginia Rail, however this list will be finalized with input from stakeholders in the region. Researchers will identify locations of climate refugia for each species and then map how well each refugia is connected to the species\u2019 current distribution as well as other refugia.   This project will result in maps of well-connected refugia that will remain crucial habitat for wildlife given current and future changes in climate. This information will support efforts of the USFWS Northeast Region to assess habitat needs for several species under federal consideration for listing as well as other Species of Greatest Conservation Need. Maps of refugia connectivity will also support the prioritization of on-the-ground habitat management in the region."}, {"node": 26, "name": "Supporting Early Career Climate Communications and Networking", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2014", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/544e5d2fe4b024090688fce6", "num_items": 2, "items": {"5cbf4b1ce4b0c3b00664fe38": {"title": "Webinar: Leveraging Web-Based Platforms such as the Early Career Climate Forum to Enhance Climate Change Communication and Engagement", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5cbf4b1ce4b0c3b00664fe38"}, "5cbf358be4b0c3b00664fcf4": {"title": "Final Report- Early Career Climate Communications and Networking", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5cbf358be4b0c3b00664fcf4"}}, "summary": "The Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey have made it a priority to train the next generation of scientists and resource managers.

This can potentially result in mismatches or asynchronies in food and habitat resources that negatively impact individual fitness, population dynamics, and ecosystem function. Numerous studies have evaluated phenological shifts in terrestrial species, particularly birds and plants, yet far fewer evaluations have been conducted for marine animals.  This project sought to improve our understanding of shifts in the timing of seasonal migration, spawning or breeding, and biological development (i.e. life stages present, dominant) of coastal fishes and migratory waterbirds along the U.S Atlantic coast. Through stakeholder engagement and outreach across the Northeast region we formed an interdisciplinary working group that developed a regional synthesis of how the timing of biological and human activities were shifting in the Gulf of Maine. We also identified two high priority case studies to focus evaluations and deeper analyses of factors contributing to observed shifts: 1) anadromous river herring in Massachusetts coastal streams, and 2) nesting seabirds across the Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge. We used a combined approach of synthesis and modeling to determine the direction, magnitude and extent of spatial shifts, as well as identify data gaps and future research needs. The results pointed to complex and location-specific phenological responses to climate-linked variables, but capacity for adaptive strategies to minimize risks to species. Project results are anticipated to increase the efficacy of management and planning tools which can be compromised when target species experience shifts in the timing of life history events.

These lands have the potential to provide valuable ecosystem services, like wildlife habitat, nutrient processing, carbon sequestration, and flood-water storage, that produce economic values in terms of recreational spending, improved water quality, and decreased flood hazards. However, floodplain managers may need tools to help them understand changing conditions on conservation lands.  This project worked with floodplain managers to identify the information most needed to understand nonstationary conditions, and to develop tools they can apply to conservation lands to improve decision making. Through an online survey and workshop with managers, the researchers found that time, funding, and a perceived disconnect between research and management limited the ability of managers to use new scientific information. However, managers revealed that they were willing to partner with scientists to identify science needs and products useful for management decisions.  Floodplain managers agreed that metrics of water inundation, including depth, extent, frequency, duration, and seasonality are the most useful metrics to inform management of floodplain conservation lands. The research team used scientific models of flood inundation under different climate scenarios to examine these metrics for the lower 500 miles of the Missouri River to aid in current and future management decisions of conservation properties. They found that annually, climate change is estimated to increase the duration, frequency, depth, and extent of flooding. However, these patterns vary seasonally, with inundation increasing in the spring and decreasing in the fall."}, {"node": 31, "name": "Projecting Changes in Snow, Lake Ice, and Winter Severity in the Great Lakes Region for Wildlife-Based Adaptation Planning", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2014", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/529e2c12e4b0516126f68ee8", "num_items": 6, "items": {"5a5fb99ae4b06e28e9bfc506": {"title": "Long-term trends in weather severity indices for dabbling ducks in eastern North America", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a5fb99ae4b06e28e9bfc506"}, "5a55355be4b01e7be242bdb4": {"title": "Final Project Report: Projecting Changes in Snow, Lake Ice, and Winter Severity in the Great Lakes Region for Wildlife-Based Adaptation Planning", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a55355be4b01e7be242bdb4"}, "58e4f9eae4b09da679997ac3": {"title": "Ice, Snow, and Swamp: Managing Deer in Michigan\u2019s Changing Climate", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58e4f9eae4b09da679997ac3"}, "58e4f45be4b09da679997aa7": {"title": "Dynamical Downscaling\u2013Based Projections of Great Lakes Water Levels", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58e4f45be4b09da679997aa7"}, "58c3073be4b0f37a93ed9185": {"title": "Projected Influences of Changes in Weather Severity on Autumn-Winter Distributions of Dabbling Ducks in the Mississippi and Atlantic Flyways during the Twenty-First Century", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58c3073be4b0f37a93ed9185"}, "5a553984e4b01e7be242bdc1": {"title": "Dynamically Downscaled Projections of Lake-Effect Snow in the Great Lakes Basin", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a553984e4b01e7be242bdc1"}}, "summary": "Winter conditions have changed substantially in the Great Lakes region over the last 50 years, with the region experiencing rising temperatures, declining lake ice cover, and increased lake-effect snow. These changes have direct implications for economically important wildlife, such as deer and waterfowl. Deer hunting alone contributes $482 million annually to Wisconsin\u2019s economy.   The goal of this project was to identify how winter severity, snowpack, and lake ice could change through the mid- and late-21st century, and how species such as the white-tailed deer and mallard duck will respond. Because currently available climate data is at too coarse a scale to provide information on future conditions for the Great Lakes, researchers transformed these models from a global-scale to a regional-scale.    Using these models, researchers found that the region could experience substantial warming, reduced lake ice cover, and increased precipitation, with more precipitation falling as rain than snow, among other changes. Snow/ice cover limit foraging by waterfowl, thereby regulating the timing/intensity of migration and their distributions during non-breeding season. Reductions in weather severity could result in delayed autumn-winter migration for dabbling ducks, which would increase foraging pressures on wetlands in the Great Lakes region \u2013 highlighting the importance of protecting these wetlands. These changes in migration patterns could also lead to potentially significant economic losses in southern flyway states, as ducks may stay in the Great Lakes region during the winter months. The primary wintertime stressors for deer are air chill and snow depth, with extreme winters triggering population declines.  Changes in wildlife abundance and distribution can incur dramatic ecological, societal, and economic impacts. Warming may support expanded deer populations and overgrazing, while elevating infectious disease threats to deer. Annually in the U.S., 13.4 million people participate in deer and migratory bird hunting, generating $21.5 billion in revenue, with the hunting industry supporting 681,000 jobs.    Predictions of the future distribution of ducks and other wildlife in the region will help guide the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Ducks Unlimited, and other stakeholders in developing conservation and adaptation strategies for vulnerable species and in mitigating the potential economic losses that might result from changes in species distribution.

Coastal habitats also provide protective ecosystem services to human communities, which are increasingly at risk to storms and sea level rise under future climate change. Understanding how climate change will impact natural and human communities is a crucial part of decision making and management related to the protection of our coasts.   In a collaborative project between the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NA LCC) and the Northeast Climate Science Center, researchers compiled existing threshold information on priority coastal fish, wildlife, and plant species as well as coastal habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and Caribbean in response to sea level rise and storm projections. As the effects of climate change on ecological and human communities grow, the possibility of crossing tipping points or thresholds of viability increases the potential for rapid and possibly irreversible changes in ecosystems. Therefore, understanding thresholds related to climate change is critical for facilitating conservation and management actions, which could help to prevent more costly and possibly catastrophic effects in the near (years to decades) and distant (decades to centuries) future. The compilation of this information will help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how natural systems will respond to climate change and how land and resource management decisions could potentially help these species.     Researchers further compiled natural and nature-based approaches to restoration and management that benefit both natural and human communities in the coastal zone, as well as synthesized information on the suite of ecosystem services provided by tidal marshes, beaches and barrier islands, mangroves, and shellfish beds. This work will inform climate change adaptation and resilience planning and assist coastal communities that must weigh important tradeoffs regarding the benefits and drawbacks of green and grey coastal infrastructure.

Known as phenology, the timing of these events is very sensitive to changes in climate (and changes in one species\u2019 phenology can impact entire food webs and ecosystems). Shifts in phenology have been described as a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the temporal and spatial responses of wildlife to climate change impacts. Thus, phenology provides one of the strongest indicators of the adaptive capacity of organisms (or the ability of organisms to cope with future environmental conditions).  In this study, researchers are exploring how the timing and occurrence of a number of highly migratory marine animals is changing due to a series of climatic and ecological shifts. First, using existing long-term historical data series, they will determine the direction and magnitude of how migration, abundance, or other phenological factors have changed for marine mammals, sea turtles, and fishes that migrate into the Gulf of Maine on a seasonal basis. Because marine animals are inherently difficult to detect, the team will apply dynamic occupancy models to evaluate seasonal migration patterns and habitat use across multiple habitats in the Gulf of Maine region. The project team will also synthesize regional information on a key, ecologically-important prey fish, sandlance, whose timing and abundance is a strong predictor of the occurrence and behavior of predator species targeted in this study as well as a range of other regional fish and wildlife of conservation and management concern. Results from this component of the project will identify coastal fish and wildlife species that are relatively more or less able to adapt and thus potentially vulnerable to climate change; determine the likely primary drivers of those changes; and identify data gaps and future monitoring needs. Ultimately, this information will be available and useful for regional coastal management and adaptation decisions that will allow managers to effectively plan for the future.   In a second component of the project, researchers will focus specifically on changes in migration patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale. While shifts in the distribution and time of recurring life events are adaptive responses that may help species cope with climate impacts, they can also lead to changes in how species interact with humans. The North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered whale species on the planet. In the North Atlantic Ocean, ship strikes and entanglements with commercial fishing gear represent fatal threats to right whales. Recent reports suggest that North Atlantic right whale migration patterns have changed. Many researchers posit that shifts in migration are responsible for recent increases in the overlap between right whales and human activities, especially fishing. To help understand how changes in right whale movements and behaviors may overlap with ship traffic, and thus put the animals at risk of encountering vessels, we will combine right whale habitat models with ship traffic maps. The end result will be a set of maps identifying risk levels.

To better anticipate these changes, there is a need to compile both short- and long-term stream temperature data for managers to gain an understanding of baseline conditions, historic trends, and future projections. Unfortunately, many agencies lack sufficient resources to compile, conduct quality assurance and control, and make accessible stream temperature data collected through routine monitoring. Yet, pooled data from many sources, even if temporally and spatially inconsistent, can have great value both in the realm of stream temperature and aquatic response. The NorEaST web portal was developed to serve as a coordinated, multi-agency regional framework to map and store continuous stream temperature locations and data for New England, Mid Atlantic, and Great Lakes states. NorEaST consists of a mapper where the public can view locations and metadata for current and historic stream temperature monitoring sites, a database where data stewards can store and manage their data, and web services to connect, communicate, and serve data for use in analysis and applications. Currently, stream temperature monitoring locations and metadata can be viewed for more than 10,000 monitoring locations across 30 states, contributed by 40 different organizations. Organizations collecting continuous stream temperature data can request to become NorEaST users and data stewards can use the web portal to store and manage their organization\u2019s continuous stream temperature data. To demonstrate the utility of large scale, consistent stream temperature data for use in regional analyses and decision-making, stream temperature data collected as part of the NorEaST project were used in three different targeted applications. These applications included generating stream thermal metrics, analyzing fish species response to stream thermal metrics, and evaluating stream temperature modeling approaches for use by aquatic resource managers.

We sought insights by examining Lake Erie as a representative system with a high level of anthropogenic impacts, strong nutrient gradients, seasonal hypoxia, and spatial overlap of cold- and cool-water fish guilds. In Lake Erie and in large embayments throughout the Great Lakes basin, this situation is a concern for fishery managers, as climate change may exacerbate hypoxia and reduce habitat volume for some species. We examined fish community composition, fine-scale distribution, prey availability, diets, and biochemical tracers for dominant fishes from study areas with medium-high nutrient levels (mesotrophic, Fairport study area), and low nutrient levels (oligotrophic, Erie study area). This multi-year database (2011-2013) provides the ability to contrast years with wide variation in rainfall, winter ice-cover, and thermal stratification. In addition, multiple indicators of dietary and distributional responses to environmental variability will allow resource managers to select the most informative approach for addressing specific climate change questions.  Our results support the incorporation of some relatively simple and cost-efficient approaches into existing agency monitoring programs to track the near-term condition status of fish and fish community composition by functional groupings. Other metrics appear better suited for understanding longer-term changes, and may take more resources to implement on an ongoing basis. Although we hypothesized that dietary overlap and similarity in selected species would be sharply different during thermal stratification and hypoxic episodes, we found little evidence of this. Instead, to our surprise, this study found that fish tended to aggregate at the edges of hypoxia, highlighting potential spatial changes in catch efficiency of the fishery.  This work has had several positive impacts on a wide range of resource management and stakeholder activities, most notably in Lake Erie. The results were instrumental in the development of an interim decision rule for dealing with data collected during hypoxic events to improve stock assessment of Yellow Perch. In addition, novel findings from this study regarding spatial and temporal variability in hypoxia have aided US-Environmental Protection Agency in the development of a modified sampling protocol to more accurately quantify the central basin hypoxic zone, and this directly addressed a goal of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 2012 to reduce the extent and severity of hypoxia. Finally, the study areas developed in this project formed the basis for food web sampling in the 2014 bi-national Coordinated Science and Monitoring Initiative work in Lake Erie.

Although some variability in fish catches is expected across factors such as location and season, we know less about how large-scale disturbances like climate change will influence population variability.  The Laurentian Great Lakes in North America are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world, and they have experienced major changes due to fluctuations in pollution and nutrient loadings, exploitation of natural resources, introductions of non-native species, and shifting climatic patterns.  In this project, we analyzed established long-term data about important fish populations from across the Great Lakes basin, including from Oneida Lake in NY, Lake Michigan, and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Our objective was to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in fish catches from large freshwater lakes that have experienced large-scale changing conditions.  We evaluated analytical approaches with the potential to disentangle sources of variability in standardized monitoring data.  Specifically, we considered 1) how the decomposition of spatial and temporal variation in fish catches can be used to measure a response to perturbation; 2) how truncation of population age structure can alter population oscillations which may shift how a population is affected by environmental fluctuations; and 3) how the composition of a fish community may respond to a suite of environmental drivers through time. Using long-term gill-net data for walleye, we found that average catch and variance structure differed before and after large-scale perturbations. More generally, our results suggest that fish population responses to changing environments can be complex, but that long-term monitoring combined with modeling approaches can allow for detection of quantifiable changes."}, {"node": 40, "name": "Science to Examine the Interactions Between Climate, Agriculture, and Water Quality", "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2012", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/51826b32e4b04bbc6ead2728", "num_items": 0, "items": {}, "summary": "The purpose of the project was to conduct an extensive search for compelted and ongoing research that deals with climate change and agriculture in the context of water quality, for the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie and Big Rivers Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) and the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes LCC.

One portion of the search dealt with an online literature search for published peer-reviewed articles for the period of approximately 2000 to present. The second portion of the search dealt with contacting US Geological Survey (USGS) Water Science Centers and state institutions to request information on current research projects dealing with this topic that have not yet been published or are currently in publication. Geographic location was considered during the search, and only projects and publications taking place within one of the LCC\u2019s were acquired. The two LCC\u2019s cover partial states in some cases, but searches were conducted for the state as a whole if any portion of the state fell within one of the two LCC's. In addition, relevant publications were obtained for southern Ontario, Canada. An outline for search methodology, including sources and keywords, was used to keep the search process consistent and well-documented. In addition, manual filtering of results was required to ensure that they were both contextually and geographically relevant.  While the effort is likely not entirely exhaustive, the methodology entailed a progression of searches using multiple search engines and resources that upon completion did not return any results that had not already been acquired. The software tool EndNote was selected for compiling the database as this tool assisted in streamlining the process of publication retrieval during the literature search. It also standardized the way in which publications were recorded and provided a means to organize, reduce redundancy, and search the database. The resulting products for each LCC were aggregated to produce one final EndNote library. The library was categorized by geographic location but can be categorized using various criteria and keyword searches within EndNote. Through cooperation with the Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA), a searchable format geared toward the general end-user can be generated.

Therefore, sea-level rise and the associated changes in coastlines challenge both human communities and ecosystems.  Understanding which coastal lands will be vulnerable to sea-level rise is critical for policy makers, land-use planners, and coastal residents. Focusing on the coastal region from Virginia to Maine, researchers examined a range of different possible sea-level rise scenarios, combined with information on features of the coastal landscape (such as elevation and land cover type), to forecast which coastal areas would likely flood, and which would likely change or move as a result of sea-level rise. Researchers found that 70 percent of the Northeast U.S. Atlantic Coast has the capacity to change over the next several decades in response to rising seas.  Knowing where coastal habitats are likely to be resilient, where they will likely change, and where they might flood as a result of sea-level rise is essential for developing management and resource allocation strategies that preserve coastal areas. By distinguishing the response of coastlines to different sea-level rise scenarios, the results of this project can inform coastal land management decision-making about how to best adapt human and natural communities to potential future changes to coastal areas.

Yet the Colorado River\u2019s water supply is already fully allocated, meaning that the economic and environmental health of the region is closely tied to the river\u2019s streamflow.   Climate projections for the Southwest show a future marked by chronic drought and substantial reductions in streamflow. The region has already been impacted by climate change, experiencing warmer temperatures and more intense drought, particularly in late spring and early summer, resulting in reduced streamflow. In order to appropriately manage the Colorado River under changing conditions, water resource planners require reliable projections of future streamflow.   This project seeks to characterize how changing climate conditions affect cool and warm season precipitation in the Colorado River basin and the corresponding impacts on streamflow. Specifically, researchers will examine whether human-caused climate change interacts with natural variations in climate (such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation) intensify climate extremes, such as severe drought.

Not only has this translated into a longer fire season, but reduced snowpack has cascading effects that impact streamflow, water supplies, agricultural productivity, and ecosystems. California receives 80% of its precipitation during the winter, so mountain snowpack plays a critical role in replenishing the state\u2019s water supply.   One factor that affects the amount of winter precipitation (and therefore snowpack) in California is the North Pacific Jet (NPJ)\u2014a current of strong, high altitude winds that occur over the northern Pacific Ocean. Winters when the NPJ is located further north than normal are drier than average in California, while winters when the NPJ is located further south are wetter. Climate change is expected to cause the position of the NPJ to become more variable, which could greatly influence California\u2019s water resources and ecosystems.   The goal of this project is to identify the relationship between the NPJ and wildfires in California. Researchers will first use tree-ring data to examine variability in the position of the NPJ over the past 400+ years to identify historical trends. They will then use historical fire data to determine how the NPJ has influenced wildfire patterns in the past. Finally, researchers will look at recent fire data to see if this historical relationship between the NPJ and fire holds true in the 21 st century.   By documenting the relationship between the NPJ and wildfires, this project will enable fire managers to better forecast future fire conditions, based on projected trends in the NPJ. Improving forecasting ability is critical to successful fire preparedness and accurate anticipation of fire suppression budgets.

Next, they identified the types of decisions in which climate information has proven to be the most useful for managers. Finally, researchers identified best practices for coordinating science needs between resource managers and climate scientists, and for transferring relevant climate information to decision-makers.

These fires were associated with extreme winds and were potentially also influenced by unusually dry conditions during several years leading up to the 2017 events. This fire season brought additional attention and emphasized the vital need for managers in the western U.S. to have access to scientific information on when and where to expect dangerous fire events. Understanding the multiple factors that cause extreme wildfire events is critical to short and long-term forecasting and planning. Seasonal climate measures such as temperature and precipitation are commonly used to explain fire occurrence and impact. However, weather events that produce extreme winds and severe temperatures over short periods of time can also have substantial impacts on fire behavior. In addition, multi-year droughts may increase fire potential by decreasing the amount of moisture in vegetation.   The goal of this project is to investigate the range of factors that may explain the variation in annual fire activity in both forested and non-forested landscapes in California. These factors will include the longer-term effects of extended droughts and the shorter-term effects of intense heat spells, low relative humidity, and extreme winds. In addition, researchers will evaluate the extent to which large fires are associated with particular fire ignition sources. Results should inform improved predictive models to show how long-term drought events and short-term extreme weather could impact future fire activity.   This project will evaluate the relative importance of these environmental factors over the last several decades, across different landscape types in California.

Recent advances have helped grow the body of literature surrounding phenology. We now know, for example, that invasive species often show greater flexibility in the timing of their phenological events, enabling them to outcompete native species as climate and environmental conditions change.  Natural resource managers recognize that changes in phenology can substantially affect their management activities. Phenological information can be used to identify when to survey for or treat invasive insects or plants, when to apply prescribed fire to maintain habitat, or when to prepare for peak tourist seasons in national parks.

With a focus on the Southwest U.S., this project will connect scientists and natural resource managers to ensure that managers are getting the right phenological information, in the right format, at the right time. Through a series of workshops, scientists with the USA National Phenology Network, the USGS, and universities will connect with resource managers from federal and state land management agencies, tribes, and private landholders to identify key decisions that would immediately benefit from phenological information.

Found in eleven western states, this important yet fragile ecosystem is dominated by sagebrush, but also contains a diversity of native shrubs, grasses, and flowering plants. It provides critical habitat for wildlife like pronghorn and threatened species such as the greater sage-grouse, and is grazed by livestock on public and private lands. However, this landscape is increasingly threatened by shifts in wildfire patterns, the spread of invasive grasses, and changing climate conditions. While sagebrush is slow to recover after fires, non-native grasses such as cheatgrass thrive in post-fire conditions and the spread of these species can increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires. These changes to the sagebrush ecosystems have implications for big game, threatened wildlife, and ranching.  To address this growing concern, resource managers will often try to limit the spread of exotic grasses after fire events by applying herbicides, or will help native species recover through seeding or planting. However, these treatments have mixed results, and poor success is often attributed to droughts, which make it more difficult for seeds and native plants to survive; to the limited amount of time in which these treatments can be applied (usually in the first year after a fire); or because the seeds or plants used aren\u2019t adapted to the environmental conditions of the location where they\u2019re applied.  The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the factors that affect post-fire treatment success. Researchers will use data collected from more than 300 fires over the last 40 years, after which treatments were applied. They will identify the impacts of drought on those treatments, how incorporating information on drought forecasts or extending the period over which treatments are applied could have altered the outcomes, and how managers can better select plant material that will be more adaptable to the conditions of planting locations.

Conifer forests in the region have demonstrated particular difficulty in recovering after fires, and in some cases have transformed into other ecosystem types, such as deciduous-dominated forests or grasslands. Such ecological transformations have implications not only for the plants and animals that depend on conifer forests for habitat, but also for the services that these forests provide humans.

Warming temperatures in spring can reduce snow-fed flows, with serious implications for the water supplies that support communities and wildlife. While it is already well-known that precipitation has a significant influence on river flow, recent observations suggest that temperature and the amount of water in soil may also influence streamflow. In the face of a changing climate, it is important that resource managers understand how factors such as changing temperatures and precipitation will affect this vital water source.  To address this need, researchers are examining records of streamflow, temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation in the upper Colorado River basin going back more than 100 years, to see how these variables have changed during periods of low flow and drought. Next, researchers will analyze tree rings to reconstruct climatic conditions over the past 1,000 years to see if more recent droughts differ from historical climate patterns. This information will help researchers determine if droughts are lasting longer or are more severe than historical droughts, improving our understanding of the impacts of climate change in the region.   So far, researchers have found that warming temperatures have played an increasingly important role over the past decades, both exacerbating droughts and dampening the effects of wet winters on high flows. The results of this study will help water managers assess the range of possible conditions that may be expected to occur in the future in the Colorado River basin, and help determine how warming temperatures may influence the river\u2019s flow and the region\u2019s water supply.

These saltmarshes, mudflats, and shallow bays are not only critical for wildlife, but they also provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Today, sea-level rise, more frequent and stronger storms, saltwater intrusion, and warming water temperatures are among the threats that are altering these important habitats.   Much of the existing research on anticipating the effects of changing conditions on coastal ecosystems relies on global or regional scale data, meaning that the detailed information necessary for local-scale decision making is often not available. Building on data collected by previous Southwest CSC research, this project focuses on local-scale monitoring of coastal habitats in California to capture current trends and effects of storm events and inundation, and to inform more detailed projections of the impacts of future changes. Researchers are working closely with federal, state, and local management agencies throughout the process, from data collection to results sharing.    So far, results suggest that moderate to high rates of sea-level rise would result in a loss of coastal wetlands, with implications for the ecosystem services that these ecosystems provide \u2013 such as wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, improved water quality, and coastal protection from storms. The results provide detailed information that can be used by California\u2019s coastal land managers to understand the vulnerability of specific sites to changing conditions, enabling decision-makers to effectively implement adaptive management strategies that will sustain the critical function of coastal habitats.

In the Southwest, more frequent and intense storms may negatively affect protected species in coastal salt marshes; changes in the timing and amount of precipitation could lead to increases in fuel loads; and increasingly humid heat waves could lead to higher incidence of heat-related illness among visitors to national parks.   This project will improve understanding of climate extremes and their potential effects in the Southwest.

While rising temperatures can create drought conditions that favor severe fires, it is also possible that drought limits the ability of trees to survive a fire. During a drought, there is less water available for trees and more outbreaks of harmful insects and pathogens can occur, both of which can weaken trees. Tree mortality is one means of measuring the severity of a fire, and evidence shows that trees exposed to drought conditions for periods of 5-10 years are already more sensitive to the effects of fire \u2013 suggesting that drought could indeed increase fire severity.   This project will examine the poorly understood relationship between drought, fire, and tree mortality in the Southwest. Researchers will use existing data on controlled burns, tree-ring analysis, and detailed climate data to determine how these variables interact. Understanding how drought and fire might work together to cause tree death is critical. More dead trees translates into poorer habitat for wildlife, increased soil erosion, and greater carbon emissions following fires \u2013 which could worsen warming trends.   The warming experienced so far in the Southwest is small compared to expected future conditions, making this analysis critical for the success of long-term forest conservation. Identifying exactly how drought and fire interact to impact trees can help forest managers better understand and plan for the effects of fire in the future.

These changes have implications for the phenology, or the timing of natural life events (e.g. the timing of plant flowering in Spring or leaves falling in Autumn), of many plant species. However, not all species and regions are changing at the same rate, which can lead to mismatches (e.g. between the emergence of plants and pollinators in early spring). Many interactions in nature depend on timing and, as such, phenology affects nearly all aspects of the environment, including the abundance, distribution, and diversity of organisms, ecosystem services, food webs, even global water and carbon cycles.   Phenology is among the best indicators of climate change impacts, in large part because phenological events are some of the most sensitive biological responses to environmental changes. Researchers are rapidly developing datasets, models, and indices that can improve our understanding of changing phenology. However, most indices of phenological change are poorly suited for water-limited ecosystems, and existing models are lacking in their ability to represent phenological change at local scales that are relevant and useful for decision making.   This project is a step towards addressing these limitations. The project team aims to use local phenology data and climate information to build new phenology indices and models for the southwestern U.S. that address several significant information gaps, with a specific focus on creating useful and relevant data products and decision-support tools for managers. These models will be used to evaluate variations in historical phenology trends based on time period, plant type, geography, and moisture availability. The team plans to generate a phenology tool that resource managers in the Southwest can use to predict phenology events (e.g. plant green-up) based on a specified climate (historical, future near-term, and long-term). This work will help to ensure that phenological information can be used to inform conservation planning and resource management decisions in the Southwest.

The central goals of this proposal are to better quantify the impact of snow droughts on municipal and ecosystem water supplies and improve the scientific information accessible to a wide range of resource managers. The project consists of three primary objectives: 1) Document the types, frequencies, and proximate causes of historical snow drought using snow and climate observations, 2) Assess streamflow forecasting abilities following snow drought using the operational regression-based forecasts used by water management agencies, and 3) Identify areas where streamflow forecast skill is improved by incorporating snow drought information.   Preliminary analyses indicate that several different types of snow droughts occur in the Southwest, arising from a variety of different factors. \u201cDry snow drought\u201d is caused by a lack of winter precipitation needed to accumulate snow. \u201cWarm snow drought\u201d can be caused by early snowmelt or by precipitation falling as rain rather than snow.

Land and resource managers, planners, and decision-makers are looking for the best scientific information to guide their decisions about adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change now and in the future. To address this need, a primary goal of the Southwest Climate Science Center is to develop actionable science \u2013 scientific information that can be easily used to inform these decisions.   Evidence shows that more collaborative forms of knowledge development and exchange between scientists and decision makers tend to produce information that is considered more trusted and usable, and lead to higher-quality decisions about environmental management. However, there is still a need for more effective ways to integrate collaboration and co-production of knowledge into established research programs and organizational frameworks. There is also a need for a process to effectively evaluate projects that no longer resemble standard academic research because they integrate decision-makers in a full and collaborative manner.   The project researchers have developed a framework for the evaluation of collaboratively produced climate science that specifically addresses the process of producing and outcomes of actionable science. Through this project, the team is using this framework to evaluate a sample of projects funded by the Southwest CSC to determine: 1) To what extent the science is being applied to management decisions in the Southwest region, 2) What the barriers are to the use of science, and 3) Which practices or strategies are most associated with the production of actionable science.   The information garnered from this project can then be used to further develop processes for conducting and evaluating co-production of science.

Red brome (B. madritensis) is an invader in the Mojave Desert, and can similarly introduce a new fire patterns to sensitive warm desert scrub. These invasions often cause management agencies to incur high costs for prevention, control, restoration, and fire responses.   Control and prevention of invasive species is challenging because the risk of invasive plants becoming abundant depends on existing plant communities, climate and weather, land use, and fire history. Moreover, scientific information on invasion risk that does exist has not always been translated into maps that planners and resource managers can use in their decision making. Broad-scale information is needed to link geographic variation in climate and disturbances (e.g. fire) to decisions on the ground regarding where to apply treatments aimed at limiting the impacts of invasions and restoring native plant composition.   This project aims to use existing datasets to understand the links between the abundance of major plant invaders and climatic extremes, land use and fire history. The project team will examine how the drivers and limits of plant abundance vary among invasive species and across the Great Basin and Mojave Desert. For example, where is cheatgrass likely to be limited by drought and temperature extremes, and are those areas vulnerable to red brome invasion? Where should we be most concerned about annual grass invasion following wildfire? The project\u2019s main objectives are to (i) describe the climatic conditions under which plant invaders occur and reach high abundance; (ii) model spatial variation in the drivers of invader abundance; and (iii) develop map products linking risk of high invasive plant cover to resource management strategies (e.g. prevention, restoration, or tolerance).

This water supply is primarily used in irrigated agriculture but also provides essential drinking water to many large metropolitan areas. Hydropower is also produced at many of the large dams on the river. River flows have declined during the past 15 years due to decreasing watershed runoff associated with a warming climate and ongoing drought. Climate projections indicate a continued decrease in future water availability as runoff continues to decline and temperatures warm. Water-users in the Colorado River basin are concerned about this declining water availability and are negotiating sustainable short- and long-term solutions that attempt to balance consumptive water use with the available supply.    These water allocation decisions have the potential to play an important role in determining the future distribution of fish species in the Colorado River basin. These species include endemic and federally-listed species. Numerous studies suggest that streamflow and water temperature have a significant influence on fish populations in the basin. The goal of this project is to identify how fish populations in the Colorado River basin might respond to future changes in water allocation and reservoir storage. Researchers will synthesize the state-of-the-science on how fish communities respond to changes in water temperature, streamflow, and sediment in the basin, and then develop tools to predict how fish populations will respond to different possible temperature and flow conditions and water storage management decisions - such as storing water in Lake Powell in the Upper Basin or Lake Mead in the Lower Basin.   Water allocation decisions in the Southwest are set to be renegotiated during the 2020s. As a result, numerous federal and state agencies are currently preparing foundational science to inform these upcoming water supply management decisions.

Reduced precipitation can also lead to lower water levels in streams and losses in the vegetation that grows alongside riverbanks.   The goal of this project was to identify how hydrologic systems in the Southwest might respond to changes in climate and the degree to which this response is dependent on the characteristics of the hydrologic system. To do this, researchers developed a tool that simulates how quickly water moves from the surface to underground aquifers.  The tool helps identify timeframes and regions where seepage of water into aquifers is likely constant, rather than fluctuating with rainfall patterns or climate. By locating these areas upfront, researchers can exclude them from their analysis and focus water supply forecasting efforts on areas where groundwater is more likely to be affected by changes in rainfall or human uses at the surface.   The model shows that areas with a shallower water table tend to have more variability in the rate at which groundwater supplies are replenished, with secondary effects related to the soil type and the period of variation. In these areas, changes in rainfall and water withdrawal for irrigation or urban use have a bigger impact on groundwater availability. Water resource managers can use this tool to more accurately forecast how much groundwater remains in different watersheds and to determine which systems will be most sensitive to changes in climate and water use. The need for better forecasting is only increasing, as aquifers are increasingly tapped and precipitation patterns are expected to become more variable.

The Leaf to Landscape project uses California\u2019s unusually hot drought as a potential preview of the future, allowing us to collect information that will help guide forest management in the face of a warming climate.   This project seeks to understand the effects of the hotter drought on Sierra Nevada forests across three different spatial scales (from leaves to landscapes): (1) water stress and the physiology of individual trees; (2) measurements of foliage dieback and tree mortality in tree populations; and (3) large landscape mapping of the vulnerability of forests to drought using airborne sensors. Linking the findings across these scales will help us better understand the thresholds of forest stress and dieback \u2013 including for the iconic giant sequoias \u2013 and how and why these thresholds vary across landscapes.

At the same time, the water supply is projected to decrease as temperatures rise, precipitation patterns change, and the frequency of extreme droughts increases.   The Central Valley also provides critical wetland habitats to migratory waterbirds, and wetland managers require information on how to best use water resources to support wildlife objectives, particularly during drought. This project seeks to evaluate how drought influences the distribution, abundance, and timing of wetland habitat in the Central Valley. This information will then be used to assess the effects of drought on habitat and food availability for waterbirds, and subsequently, waterbird movements.   There is currently a lack of available data on wetland habitat in the Central Valley, as well as on how waterbird movements are influenced by habitat availability. Using near real-time tracking of waterbird habitats and movements, this study will address both of these needs and will enable researchers to identify gaps in habitat availability and food resources for waterbirds that occur as a result of drought. The results of this study will provide critical guidance for managers seeking to efficiently allocate limited water resources and provide the best possible habitat for waterbirds in the Central Valley, even during drought.

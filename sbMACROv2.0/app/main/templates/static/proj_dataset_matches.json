Though the potential impacts of climate change can be modeled to help decision-makers plan for future conditions, these models rarely incorporate changes in land-use that may occur. Climate change and land-use change are often linked, as shifts in precipitation and temperature can alter patterns in human land-use activities, such as agriculture.  This project seeks to address this gap by developing new software tools that enable stakeholders to quickly develop custom, climate-sensitive land-use projections to satisfy a range of application needs. Stakeholders from across the region will participate in the development of the model through two workshops, designed to first gather stakeholder needs and then to apply and evaluate the model to ensure that it maximizes potential use across all stakeholder groups.  Users of the end-product will be able to build customized, scenario-based projections of landscape change, including landscape response to climate change, such as wildfires or altered vegetation patterns. The projections generated with these tools will enable decision-makers and land-use planners to visualize potential future landscapes, optimize land management practices, and adapt to negative impacts of climate and land-use change on ecological and economic systems.

In the face of a changing climate, it is important that resource managers understand how factors such as changing temperatures and precipitation will affect this vital water source.  To address this need, researchers are examining records of streamflow, temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation in the upper Colorado River basin going back more than 100 years, to see how these variables have changed during periods of low flow and drought. Next, researchers will analyze tree rings to reconstruct climatic conditions over the past 1,000 years to see if more recent droughts differ from historical climate patterns. This information will help researchers determine if droughts are lasting longer or are more severe than historical droughts, improving our understanding of the impacts of climate change in the region.   So far, researchers have found that warming temperatures have played an increasingly important role over the past decades, both exacerbating droughts and dampening the effects of wet winters on high flows.

Most river fish are harvested by small-scale operations and in countries that lack the necessary infrastructure and technology that would enable regular reporting of harvests.

For example, plants might be relocated to support pollinator conservation or the restoration of prairies. Some land managers, in an effort to be proactive in the face of changing environmental conditions, are also considering relocating plants to sites that are considered more similar to anticipated future conditions. However, moving plants can be ecologically and economically risky. It\u2019s possible that pests, pathogens, or contaminant weeds can be inadvertently moved along with the target plant material. In 2016, the noxious weed Palmer amaranth was introduced to Minnesota as a contaminant in seed brought in to improve Monarch butterfly and pollinator habitat. This fast growing weed is capable of reducing soybean yields by 78% and corn yields by 91%, and requires costly resources to fight its spread.   One factor that impacts the risk associated with plant movement is the distance between the source of the plant and where it is being relocated to. If the source is located near the translocation site, it is less likely to be contaminated with new weeds or pathogens. The goal of this project is to create a framework for evaluating risk associated with the movement of plant material. The first tier of the framework will describe the future condition of the species, site, or community of concern, if plant movement is implemented and if it is not. The second tier will assess the ecological risks associated with moving plant material. This will include identifying potential pathogens, weeds, and pests that might be associated with plants from different areas and could be inadvertently introduced during translocation, and evaluating the potential harm these species might cause if introduced. The benefit of such a framework will be to greatly reduce the likelihood of unintended introductions of pests and noxious species. It will also take into account the ability of plants to adapt to expected future environmental conditions in their new locations. This work will support a range of stakeholders, including private, state, federal, and non-profit land managers who undertake planting for conservation or restoration.

So too is identifying ways in which managers can better incorporate information on climate and the vulnerability of resources into their decision-making.   This project sought to improve decision-making in the North Central region by developing an approach to managing natural resources that acknowledges the uncertainties that exist and incorporates the adaptive capacity and vulnerability of resources to climate change. To meet this goal, researchers assessed (1) the key factors that affect the ability of human and ecological communities to adapt to climate change; (2) the current vulnerability of communities to changing conditions; and (3) the current risk assessment methodologies being used by managers in the region.

The distribution and flow of water on a landscape influences many ecological functions, such as the distribution and health of vegetation and soil development and function. However, the future of many important water resources remains uncertain. Reduced snowfall and snowpack, earlier spring runoff, increased winter streamflow and flooding, and decreased summer streamflow have all been identified as potential impacts to water resources due to climate change. These factors all influence the water balance in the Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest (PCTR).  Ensuring healthy flow and availability of water resources is often highlighted as a priority in land management planning and adaptation. Improved measurement and modeling of water is required to develop predictive estimates for future plant distributions, soil moisture, and snowpack, which all play important roles in ecosystem planning.  The goal of this project is to develop a model to predict future groundwater.

The extent of this dataset includes all of the Alaska and Canada watersheds that discharge into southeast Alaska coastal waters, which covers essentially the northern half of the full PCTR.    The transboundary DEM used to calculate the CTI can be here: [link](http://ckan.snap.uaf.edu/dataset/a-continuous-transboundary-50-meter-dem-for-the-alaska-perhumid-coastal-temperate-rainforest-ak06b59)  Flow accumulation is represented by a grid of specific catchment area (SCA), which is the contributing area per unit contour length using the multiple flow direction D-infinity approach. Unit contour length is equal to the DEM resolution of 50 meters.   **There are two versions of both the CTI and SCA provided:**  *CTI_AKPCTR_NoFlowMask.tif and SCA_AKPCTR_NoFlowMask.tif* This is the resulting CTI file when no masks are applied to the study area before the CTI procedure is run. After the CTI procedure is run, all glacial areas are masked out, as CTI is not meaningful over glaciers.  *CTI_AKPCTR_FlowMask.tif and SCA_AKPCTR_FlowMask.tif* This is the resulting CTI file where prior to running the CTI procedure, we apply a mask across all active glaciers and all downslope cells receiving flow from glacially affected cells. These masked cells are excluded from the CTI procedure. This results in fewer CTI values on the landscape. This dataset is provided to identify cells in the direct downslope path of glaciers because CTI values for cells receiving upslope accumulation from glaciers may not be reliable due to uncertainties in surface water flowpaths in glaciated areas.  **Processing Steps:** 1. Using the pitremove function from [TAUDEM](http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/index.html), filled sinks in the DEM following the method of Planchon and Darboux (2001).  2. (For **_FlowMask* versions only) Mask out glacial areas and associated downslope cells. Prior to calculating flow direction and flow accumulation, change cells in the filled DEM to NoData where glaciers exist, using the [Randolph Glacier Inventory version 5.0](https://www.glims.org/RGI/rgi50_dl.html) raster dataset to identify the presence of glaciers. Cells downslope from the masked glaciers will then also be identified as NoData in subsequent processing and the final CTI raster. Compute D-infinity slopes and flow direction and flow accumulation (as specific catchment area) rasters from the filled DEM using TAUDEM D-infinity method. As part of the D-infinity routine, TauDEM uses the method of Garbrecht &amp; Martz (1997) to resolve flats.  3. The D-infinity slope raster was modified in the following way: if slope = 0, then change slope value to 0.0001; otherwise leave slope value unchanged. This was done to avoid dividing by zero when calculating CTI.  4. Compute Compound Topographic Index (CTI) using these steps: Dsca = D-infinity specific catchment area raster Dslp = D-infinity slope raster Then, CTI = Ln(Dsca/Dslp)  5. Clip the CTI raster to the Alaska perhumid coastal temperate rainforest (AKPCTR) watershed boundary   The motivation for developing this dataset was to support research studies focused on the Alaska perhumid coastal temperate rainforest.

The perhumid (wettest) region of the North American coastal temperate rainforest (PCTR) extends along the coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska between approximately 50.57 and 59.6 degrees north latitude.The extent of this dataset includes all of the Alaska and Canada watersheds that discharge into southeast Alaska coastal waters, which covers essentially the northern half of the PCTR.   **General Methods:**  Using Desktop ArcGIS version 10.3.1, the following three elevation datasets were combined to create a continuous DEM for the Alaska perhumid coastal temperate rainforest (AKPCTR) watersheds:  1) The 2-arc-second, 1:63360, [USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED)](http:/usgs.seamless.gov), downloaded 12/4/2008. Horizontal datum=NAD83; vertical datum=NGVD29; map units=decimal degrees; elevation units=meters. [Note: the term \"3DEP\" has replaced \"NED.\"]  2) The 25-meter resolution, 1:20,000 British Columbia Terrain Resource Information Management (TRIM) DEM, downloaded 9/4/2009. Horizontal datum=NAD83; vertical datum=CGVD28; projection=BC Albers; map units=meters; elevation units=meters.  3) The 0.75-arc-second, 1:50,000 [Canadian Digital Elevation Data (CDED)](ftp://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/geobase/official/cded/50k_dem/) DEM for the Yukon Territory, downloaded 8/11/2015. Horizontal datum=NAD83; vertical datum=CGVD28; map units=decimal degrees; elevation units=meters.  The 3 DEMs were projected to a common coordinate system, resolution, and registration. The Canadian TRIM and CDED datasets were combined, then a program called \u201cMerge\u201d was used to join the Canada DEM to the NED. The different processing methods, scales, and vertical datums used to produce the source U.S. and Canada DEMs result in a visible seam where the 2 datasets are joined. The \u201cMerge\u201d program creates a smooth transition along the seam between the NED and Canada DEMs (see process steps for details).  Portions of the NED for Southeast Alaska have been updated with higher-resolution IfSAR and LiDAR data; however the vertical datum for this newer data is based on NAVD88. Using the updated portions of the NED would result in an AKPCTR DEM containing a mix of NAVD88, NGVD29, and CGVD28 elevations. There are no datum converters for Alaska to easily transform between NAVD88 and NGVD29 or CGVD28. To avoid the mix of vertical datums and to be more consistent with adjacent Canadian elevations in CGVD28, the older version of the NED (pre-LiDAR and IfSAR) was used.

More information can be found at the conference website: http://pnwclimateconference.org.  The Fourth Annual Pacific Northwest Climate Science Conference was held in Portland, Oregon from September 5-6, 2013.

The estuary is also located on the Pacific Flyway, and is an important site for migrating and wintering birds. As climate conditions change, these salt marshes face a number of threats, including accelerated rates of sea-level rise, shifting precipitation, erosion, and more frequent and intense storms. Seas in the San Francisco Bay estuary have been rising 2.2 centimeters per decade, and could rise by as much as 1.24 meters by 2100, according to some projections.   The goal of this project was to identify how marsh plant communities in the San Francisco Bay estuary might be impacted by sea-level rise through 2100. Understanding the changes in salt marsh habitat will help wildlife managers identify the possible effects on wildlife species, enabling managers to start developing adaptation strategies now. To do this, researchers collected elevation, vegetation, and water level data at 12 tidal salt marshes around the San Francisco Bay estuary between 2008 and 2011. Using this information, they predicted the rate of marsh growth (i.e. accretion) and changes in plant communities at the sites through 2100.   Results show that the effects of sea-level rise will increase threats to already vulnerable wildlife in the San Francisco Bay estuary. Although some parts of the study area are projected to maintain marsh vegetation through 2100, these areas only comprise 4 percent of the total marsh area surveyed. The remaining 96 percent of marshes in the study area are projected to transition to mudflats by 2100. In fact, most areas are projected to lose high and mid-marsh vegetation by 2050. This type of vegetation provides critical habitat to the salt marsh harvest mouse, California black rail, and nesting songbirds.

Making land acquisition choices for a large, terrestrial protected area is difficult because it occurs over a long timeframe and may involve consideration of future conditions such as climate and urbanization changes. Decision makers need to consider factors including: order of parcel purchasing given budget constraints, future uncertainty, potential future landscape-scale changes from urbanization, and climate. In central Florida, two new refuges and the expansion of a third refuge are in various stages of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) planning. The Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge (EHNWR) has recently been established. The new refuges were strategically located for both species adaptation from climate change impacts as well as currently hosting a number of important threatened and endangered species and habitats.

Utilizing a SDM approach and optimal solution theory, we used stakeholder-determined objectives to design optimal configurations for the refuge and help FWS in land acquisition prioritization.

Sea level rise threatens the very existence of RMI as high-end projections of sea level rise by the end of the century exceed the average elevation of these low atoll reef islands. Already, waves wash over Majuro during \u201cking tides\u201d when strong winds blow from the west across the broad lagoon, or when there are high open ocean waves. Flooding waves breach island shores in multiple locations and wash into homes, cemeteries, across roads, and into commercial districts. Over the past decade, there has been a widespread exodus of residents to locations in Hawai\u02bbi and the continental U.S. as life becomes increasingly untenable on these low sand and gravel islands.  In order for Majuro and RMI leaders and decision makers to plan and implement a strategy for moving forward, scientific information and geospatial data are needed to model the timing and spatial pattern of future flooding in the first and most vulnerable areas. This project team will use a digital elevation model (DEM), currently under development, for the Majuro Atoll to model sea level rise and develop flooding simulations to help identify vulnerable areas. The team will also collect topographic and bathymetric data on Majuro to extend the areas covered by the DEM to provide a more comprehensive view of future wave flooding associated with sea level rise.  In later years of the project, the team plans to utilize existing data on groundwater and collect new information on Majuro\u2019s water table to model and understand water table dynamics in order to simulate inundation of saltwater into groundwater due to sea level rise. A primary goal of this project is to distribute project deliverables and provide training in their interpretation and application to Marshallese government agencies to inform mitigation and adaptation.

Therefore, connectivity, or the ability of organisms to move among habitat patches, is a critical component of landscape health. In addition to influencing the sustainability of wildlife populations and communities, connectivity also contributes to the availability of ecosystem services. The goal of this project was to evaluate terrestrial connectivity across the South Central United States, with a focus on the impact of projected climate and land use changes.  The researchers addressed this goal using a variety of approaches, including evaluating connectivity of major habitat types (grasslands and forests), predicting future changes in landscape connectivity for grassland species, assessing terrestrial vertebrate diversity in relation to habitat loss and fragmentation, and analyzing the combined effects of climate and habitat fragmentation on the distributions of grassland bird species.  They found that connectivity has declined for species with a low to moderate ability to move across the landscape, and that this pattern is expected to continue under future scenarios of land-use change. For grassland birds, the contribution of climate, landscape variables, and their combined effects varied among species, but their combined effects can exceed the independent effects of the two drivers for some species. Thus, the importance of connectivity is expected to increase with the negative implications of climate change for wildlife populations and communities. These results, which are expressed in maps, can be used to inform management decisions and identify future research needs related to terrestrial connectivity within this region.

This study uses maple syrup production as a case study for evaluating how these two downscaling techniques perform in terms of projecting changes in the tapping season. Maple syrup producers are interested in how climate change will affect their industry. Our results will give them a sense of the range they can expect for different aspects of the tapping season (timing of tap date, length of season, quality of sap, etc.). However, producers are a secondary audience for this study. The primary audience is the greater ecology community, as this will show the importance of careful selection of different climate modeling products and a sense of the limitations of different products.", "proj_phrases": ["general approaches", "different institutions", "secondary audience", "broad approaches", "different aspects", "finer resolution", "dynamical models", "climate variables", "maple syrup production", "greater ecology community", "tap date", "primary audience", "careful selection", "climate change", "different climate modeling products", "downscaling", "different climate", "case study", "past studies", "statistical algorithms", "coarse-scale global climate model", "maple syrup producers", "ecological metrics", "localized detail", "study uses maple syrup production", "global climate model", "different products", "global models", "ecology community"], "num_items": 1, "avg_item_sim": 0.5792, "proj_items": {"5ce5798ee4b0bc180232e7ce": {"similarities": [["warming climate", "different climate", 0.625], ["warming climate", "global climate model", 0.5143], ["useful information", "careful selection", 0.5143], ["potential changes", "general approaches", 0.5143], ["potential changes", "climate change", 0.5806], ["point data", "tap date", 0.5556], ["climate model data", "climate variables", 0.5143], ["climate model data", "climate change", 0.5625], ["climate model data", "different climate modeling products", 0.6038], ["climate model data", "coarse-scale global climate model", 0.5098], ["climate model data", "localized detail", 0.5294], ["climate model data", "global climate model", 0.6842], ["climate model data", "global models", 0.5161], ["project future change", "climate change", 0.5714], ["maple syrup", "maple syrup production", 0.6667], ["maple syrup", "maple syrup producers", 0.6875], ["future studies", "past studies", 0.6923], ["climate scientists", "climate variables", 0.5143], ["climate scientists", "climate change", 0.625], ["absolute range", "climate change", 0.5714], ["statistically", "statistical algorithms", 0.6857], ["various aspects", "different aspects", 0.5625], ["absolute values", "climate variables", 0.5625], ["information", "finer resolution", 0.5185], ["different types", "different institutions", 0.6486], ["different types", "different aspects", 0.8125], ["different types", "different climate modeling products", 0.52], ["different types", "different climate", 0.75], ["different types", "different products", 0.7273], ["maple syrup industry", "maple syrup production", 0.7143], ["maple syrup industry", "maple syrup producers", 0.7317], ["maple syrup industry", "study uses maple syrup production", 0.566]], "item_summary": "A final summary figure summarizing the results of a study that compares two different downscaling techniques in terms of how they project future change in various aspects of the maple syrup tapping season.

The results show that dynamically downscaled models fail to adequately forecast absolute values of future conditions but do capture potential changes in year-to-year variability \u2014 a metric of particular concern to producers as it challenges planning. Statistically downscaled models, while they do adequately capture the absolute range in future conditions (i.e., produce reasonable values, i.e., all positive, as would be expected in a warming climate), they dampen the effects on year-to-year variability. In summary, both downscaling methods have strengths and weaknesses, and both provide useful information to producers. Therefore, complete information requires both downscaling types.

As human populations grow, the demand for urbanized areas will increase, and scientists can help natural resource managers plan for these changes by creating models that predict potential patterns of future urbanization. The Southeast U.S. is experiencing particularly rapid population growth, as a favorable winter climate has drawn millions to the region from other areas of the country over the past several decades. However, the Southeast is also at risk from the effects of climate change, particularly along its vast coastline, where over a quarter of the region\u2019s population lives. Recent studies have called attention to the potential for flooding from sea-level rise to motivate residents to move from low-lying coastal areas to less risky inland locations at higher elevation. To date, no research has explicitly considered how the existing flow of people into the region will interact with the potentially increasing drive to move away from the coast.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service, and state fish and wildlife agency partners have requested that the Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center provide updated urbanization and habitat change scenarios to meet regulatory obligations, as species status assessments and state wildlife action plans, and make facility management decisions. This project will build on prior efforts to develop more comprehensive scenarios of future urbanization patterns in the southeastern U.S. These scenarios will take into account two potentially counteracting phenomenon: 1) an increasing redistribution of people from coastal and low-lying areas as they become more vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and 2) existing migration flows from other parts of the country into the Southeast, which also could change as the climate warms.  The resulting scenarios and maps of potential future urban change will allow natural resource decision makers to visualize and anticipate hotspots of urbanization and population movement across the Southeast in the coming decades. Information on the combined effects of urbanization and climate change can help inform management of the region\u2019s wildlife, ecosystems, and habitats of concern.

E0 is calculated using the Penman Monteith FAO56 reference evapotranspiration formulation driven by temperature, humidity, wind speed, and incoming solar radiation from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2) dataset. For a particular time-window, EDDI is estimated by standardizing the E0 anomalies relative to the whole period of the record (1979-present), using a non-parametric method (see Hobbins et al., 2016). For plotting purposes, EDDI values are binned into different percentile categories analogous to the US Drought Monitor plots. However, in case of EDDI plots, both drought and anomalously wet categories are shown. EDDI data are available at a ~12-km resolution across CONUS since January 1, 1980, and are updated daily.  EDDI has the potential to offer early warning of agricultural drought, hydrologic drought, and fire-weather risk by providing real-time information on the emergence or persistence of anomalous evaporative demand in a region.

However, this data requires extensive quality control and homogenization due to documented and undocumented station moves and other factors including human errors in recording or digitization. Station-based Pan Evaporation measurements (in mm) from 247 stations across the continental United States were compiled and quality controlled for the analysis shown in Dewes et al., 2017. This dataset reports warm season (May-October; for 21 stations the data is only available for May-September) pan evaporation with at least 20 years of data between 1950 and 2001. Both monthly values and long-term monthly averages are made available, including the climatological measure for standard deviation and coefficient of variation. Dewes et al. (2017) used this dataset to evaluate the ability of different E0 formulations \u2013 Hargreaves-Samani, Priestly-Taylor, and Penman-Monteith \u2013 to reproduce the spatial patterns of observed warm-season E0 and its interannual variability. This data is an extension of the dataset described in Hobbins (2004) and Hobbins et al. (2004) with 21 additional stations north of 41oN latitude. The extension was needed in order to include data in the North Central Climate Science Center region. For these added stations, the procedure described in Hobbins (2004) for quality control was applied, including an adjustment in the mean when documented station moves occurred, and the removal of obvious outliers. The quality control procedure for the extended dataset did not automate tests for undocumented inhomogeneities for these stations. For all stations, a visual inspection of the timeseries was used to add additional breakpoints in the data for homogenization (only two were added in the extended set), and to eliminate two stations from consideration. The pan evaporation dataset compiled from 247 stations across the continental United Stated (CONUS) provides an independent measure of the \"observed\" atmospheric evaporative demand (E0) for a period between 1950 and 2001. It is therefore unique in that capacity because almost all other estimations of E0 are mathematically derived using basic meteorological variables. This dataset, which has gone through several quality control procedures, is expected to be particularly instructive to the research community in validating modeled evaporative demand terms (potential or reference evapotranspiration), which could include examining the model's ability to correctly simulate the nature of temporal and spatial varibility in E0 across CONUS.", "item_url":

IPSL-CM5A-MR, simulations (r1i1p1) from two emissions scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5), which are downscaled using the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analog (MACA) method. These projections are available as five different (approximately) 30-year climate normals between 1950 and 2099 as monthly values, except for Aridity Index which are annual values. The five periods for which these climate normals are provided are 1950-1979 and 1980-2005 in the historic, and 2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2099 in the future. The nine climate variables include aridity index (unitless), potential evapotranspiration (mm), precipitation (mm), relative humidity (%), downward solar radiation (W.m-2), maximum daily temperature (C), minimum daily temperature (C), average temperature (C), vapor pressure deficit (Pa). Most of these variables were directly available from the 4km MACAv2-METDATA archive at the monthly time frequency, while others such as aridity index, relative humidity, average temperature and vapor pressure deficits were calculated additionally.

Detailed information on the extent and distribution of emergent marsh vegetation types throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico coast has been historically unavailable. In response, the U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Ducks Unlimited, Inc., and the Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, produced a classification of emergent marsh vegetation types from Corpus Christi Bay, Texas, to Perdido Bay, Alabama.  This study incorporates about 9,800 ground reference locations collected via helicopter surveys in coastal wetland areas. Decision-tree analyses were used to classify emergent marsh vegetation types by using ground reference data from helicopter vegetation surveys and independent variables such as multitemporal satellite-based multispectral imagery from 2009 to 2011, bare-earth digital elevation models based on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), alternative contemporary land cover classifications, and other spatially explicit variables. Image objects were created from 2010 National Agriculture Imagery Program color-infrared aerial photography. The final classification is a 10-meter raster dataset that was produced by using a majority filter to classify image objects according to the marsh vegetation type covering the majority of each image object. The classification is dated 2010 because the year is both the midpoint of the classified multitemporal satellite-based imagery (2009\u201311) and the date of the high-resolution airborne imagery that was used to develop image objects. The seamless classification produced through this work can be used to help develop and refine conservation efforts for priority natural resources.

Detailed information on the extent and distribution of emergent marsh vegetation types throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico coast has been historically unavailable. In response, the U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Ducks Unlimited, Inc., and the Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, produced a classification of emergent marsh vegetation types from Corpus Christi Bay, Texas, to Perdido Bay, Alabama.  This study incorporates about 9,800 ground reference locations collected via helicopter surveys in coastal wetland areas. Decision-tree analyses were used to classify emergent marsh vegetation types by using ground reference data from helicopter vegetation surveys and independent variables such as multitemporal satellite-based multispectral imagery from 2009 to 2011, bare-earth digital elevation models based on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), alternative contemporary land cover classifications, and other spatially explicit variables. Image objects were created from 2010 National Agriculture Imagery Program color-infrared aerial photography. The final classification is a 10-meter raster dataset that was produced by using a majority filter to classify image objects according to the marsh vegetation type covering the majority of each image object. The classification is dated 2010 because the year is both the midpoint of the classified multitemporal satellite-based imagery (2009\u201311) and the date of the high-resolution airborne imagery that was used to develop image objects. The seamless classification produced through this work can be used to help develop and refine conservation efforts for priority natural resources.

Coastal habitats also provide protective ecosystem services to human communities, which are increasingly at risk to storms and sea level rise under future climate change. Understanding how climate change will impact natural and human communities is a crucial part of decision making and management related to the protection of our coasts.   In a collaborative project between the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NA LCC) and the Northeast Climate Science Center, researchers compiled existing threshold information on priority coastal fish, wildlife, and plant species as well as coastal habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and Caribbean in response to sea level rise and storm projections. As the effects of climate change on ecological and human communities grow, the possibility of crossing tipping points or thresholds of viability increases the potential for rapid and possibly irreversible changes in ecosystems. Therefore, understanding thresholds related to climate change is critical for facilitating conservation and management actions, which could help to prevent more costly and possibly catastrophic effects in the near (years to decades) and distant (decades to centuries) future. The compilation of this information will help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how natural systems will respond to climate change and how land and resource management decisions could potentially help these species.     Researchers further compiled natural and nature-based approaches to restoration and management that benefit both natural and human communities in the coastal zone, as well as synthesized information on the suite of ecosystem services provided by tidal marshes, beaches and barrier islands, mangroves, and shellfish beds. This work will inform climate change adaptation and resilience planning and assist coastal communities that must weigh important tradeoffs regarding the benefits and drawbacks of green and grey coastal infrastructure.

Hence, berries have both nutritional and cultural significance.   From 2008 to 2012, wild berry populations in the Chugach region were decimated by an unexpected outbreak of moths, thought to have been brought about by shifting climate (i.e., warmer temperatures allowed a greater number of moths to survive the winter). This outbreak amounted to a total loss of blueberry and salmonberry harvests during these years, jeopardizing a tribal for-profit enterprise in the region. It also led to a need to restore berry production and to prepare for future threats from damaging insects.  The goal of this project was to create maps and models that would help tribal and other land managers identify prime areas for berry restoration. Researchers used a variety of information sources, including remote sensing imagery, field data, and local tribal knowledge, to develop and verify these products.

These woodlands have been identified by several stakeholders, including natural resource management entities, federal and state agencies, and numerous tribal nations, as important ecosystems that are currently threatened by land treatments, changes in disturbance regimes such as drought and fire, and widespread tree mortality. Currently there exist competing objectives for the management of these systems, including the desire to preserve pinyon-juniper viability as climate conditions continue to shift, as well as the need to track these systems to ensure their ranges do not expand into historically non-forested areas. The Southern Rockies Landscape Conservation Cooperative (SRLCC), which considers pinyon-juniper woodlands among their focal resources, recently conducted vulnerability assessments of these woodlands in the four corners and upper Rio Grande landscapes. In a series of workshops to discuss these assessments, stakeholders identified the need for synthesizing regional knowledge of pinyon-juniper woodland structure and dynamics, which can differ dramatically due to the geographically broad distribution of this ecosystem.   The goal of this project is to synthesize the state of the science on pinyon-juniper woodland ecosystems by examining previous research and management practices to identify what is known and what remains to be studied. To do this, researchers are compiling published, peer-reviewed, scientific manuscripts and agency reports on the structure, function, and management of pinyon-juniper ecosystems into a comprehensive database. Unpublished material from land managers who work with pinyon-juniper systems, libraries at the US Forest Service, USGS, and other agencies will also be incorporated. The end product will be a state of the science report evaluating the influence current management decisions and climatic conditions have on possible adaptation strategies for pinyon-juniper woodlands.", "proj_phrases": ["cooperative", "agency reports", "current management decisions", "pinyon-juniper ecosystems", "climatic conditions", "us forest service", "natural resource management entities", "unpublished material", "pinyon-juniper woodland structure", "unpublished", "cultural resources", "forest service", "influence current management decisions", "possible adaptation strategies", "previous research", "pinyon-juniper viability", "srlcc", "considers pinyon-juniper woodlands", "numerous tribal nations", "upper rio grande landscapes", "pinyon-juniper systems", "rio grande", "land treatments", "pinyon-juniper", "western landscapes", "rockies landscape", "pinyon-juniper woodlands", "widespread tree mortality", "end product", "state agencies", "broad distribution", "scientific manuscripts", "watershed protection", "disturbance regimes", "major part", "pinyon-juniper woodland ecosystems", "usgs", "science report", "land managers", "management practices", "recreational use", "comprehensive database", "southern rockies landscape conservation cooperative", "vulnerability assessments", "important ecosystems", "currently", "wildlife habitats", "focal resources", "climate conditions", "regional knowledge"], "num_items": 0, "avg_item_sim": 0, "proj_items": {}}, "5a0b42f5e4b09af898cb704d": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a0b42f5e4b09af898cb704d", "proj_summary": "Alaska\u2019s land, water, plants, wildlife, and seasons are undergoing a great upheaval, and its people, especially the communities living in remote villages are directly and severely impacted by these widespread environmental changes.

Once it reaches the ground, rain can either run off and contribute to water flow in streams, or it can infiltrate into the ground and provide water for plants and recharge aquifers and groundwater. The exact route that water takes is controlled by many factors, including the duration and intensity of rainfall, the topography of the land, soil properties, and vegetation.   The introduction and spread of invasive plants and animals in Hawaiian forests, which alters the water-use and soil characteristics of ecosystems, can have large impacts on downstream water users. Increased demand and competition for limited water resources in Hawai\u02bbi has underscored the need for a better understanding of this relationship; however, relevant statewide data is currently lacking.   The objective of this project is to understand how expanding invasive plant populations and changing rainfall patterns will impact water resources in the future. Project researchers are exploring the differences in key soil characteristics that control runoff and groundwater recharge in managed and relatively intact native mesic (moderate amounts of water) and wet forests and in similar invasive-dominated forests. Primary soil characteristics of interest are the hydraulic conductivity of soils (ability of water to move through soils) and soil hydrophobicity (a property that causes water to collect on the surface rather than infiltrating into the ground). Data will also be collected on the canopy and understory composition in the forests and on disturbances by invasive animals, like feral pigs.

The basin has a long history of development and diversion of water resources, meaning that streamflow records that reflect natural, unmanaged flows over the past century have been rare. As a result, research on the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation in driving droughts and surface water variability in the Missouri River Basin has lagged behind similar work done in other major basins in the country, and has hindered drought planning efforts.   To address this need, researchers will use tree-rings to develop reconstructions of historic, natural streamflow in the Upper Missouri River Basin. This will be the first such network of hydrologic reconstructions for the basin. Specifically, the tree-ring analysis will provide information on precipitation, temperature, and streamflow for the basin going back 800 years. This historical information will then be used to explore the drivers of drought and periods of high flow in the basin, beyond just precipitation. For example, evidence suggests that temperature is an increasingly important driver of drought, and an analysis of the impacts of warming temperatures on streamflow can be used to help managers anticipate future impacts on water supplies in the basin. Lastly, researchers will work closely with engineers and water managers with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to integrate information on droughts and natural variability in streamflow into their water operations and drought planning efforts. Through this effort, researchers will seek to address questions such as \u201cwhat are the impacts to current water operations under severe droughts, like the 1930s Dust Bowl or 1500s megadrought?\u201d and \u201chow could operations be changed to improve water management for droughts like these, given projected future warming?\u201d.

They are also vulnerable to climate change. In particular, changes in winter climate (warmer temperatures and fewer freeze events) may transform coastal wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico, as mangrove forests are expected to expand their range and replace salt marshes.   The objective of this research was to evaluate the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. As part of this project, researchers identified important thresholds for ecosystem changes and highlighted coastal areas in the southeastern U.S. (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, and parts of Florida) where relatively small changes in winter conditions could cause relatively dramatic changes in coastal wetlands. Results indicate that mangrove forest expansion will bring about both above- and below-ground ecosystem changes. The most striking and apparent changes will occur above ground as forests develop and replace grasslands. These above-ground transformations will increase carbon storage and affect certain societal benefits provided by coastal wetlands in the region. The below-ground changes due to mangrove expansion will be more subtle and dependent upon the marsh that is being replaced. The below-ground impacts will be greatest along dry coasts (Texas), where mangrove expansion is expected to result in greater peat development and soil carbon storage. That said, there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d model for what will happen \u2013 the type and extent of changes will depend heavily on the specific characteristics of the site.

The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

the southeastern U.S. Warmer winter temperatures and reductions in the intensity of freeze events would likely lead to mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement in parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

and reductions in the intensity of freeze events would likely lead to mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement in parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

change has the potential to have a large impact on coastal wetlands in the southeastern U.S. Warmer winter temperatures and reductions in the intensity of freeze events would likely lead to mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement in parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

We developed simple winter climate-based models to predict mangrove forest distribution and relative abundance using observed winter temperature data (1970\u20132000) and mangrove forest and salt marsh habitat data. Our results identify winter climate thresholds for salt marsh\u2013mangrove forest interactions and highlight coastal areas in the southeastern United States (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, and parts of Florida) where relatively small changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme winter events could cause relatively dramatic landscape-scale ecosystem structural and functional change in the form of poleward mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The ecological implications of these marsh-to-mangrove forest conversions are poorly understood, but would likely include changes for associated fish and wildlife populations and for the supply of some ecosystem goods and services. In this study, we investigated the potential for winter climate change-induced mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement in the southeastern United States via a 30-year observed climate

would likely lead to mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement in parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

and reductions in the intensity of freeze events would likely lead to mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement in parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

Since 2011, Suicide Basin has been collecting melt- and rainwater each summer, creating a temporary glacier-dammed lake. Water that accumulates typically gets released through channels that run beneath the glacier. These channels are normally blocked by ice, but if the water pressure gets too high the channel breaks open, rapidly draining the basin in what is known as an \u201coutburst flood\u201d. In past years, these events have led to flooding along Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River in the most heavily populated neighborhood of Juneau.   Because of the threats posed to infrastructure in the Mendenhall Valley, it is critical that scientists closely monitor and forecast outburst flood events. The goal of this project is to design a tool to improve forecasting of the timing and flood peak associated with outburst events from Suicide Basin. The forecasting tool will be web-interfaced and provide real-time monitoring data from a USGS streamflow gage in Suicide Basin. After the onset of an outburst flood event, the web tool will also provide continuously updated forecasts of the flood peak (including timing) that will be used by the National Weather Service and the City and Borough of Juneau to warn the public about closures and threats to life and property. Accurate forecasts will improve the process of initiating and implementing closures and evacuations in the Mendenhall Valley.

In October 2015, project researchers hosted and facilitated a 1.5 day workshop, \u201cData Storage, Dissemination and Harvesting\u201d, that brought together over 50 stakeholders from state and federal agencies, tribal governments, universities, and non-profit organizations interested in monitoring stream temperature with a particular emphasis on aggregating individual organizational efforts into regional analyses. This workshop built off of previous efforts of a Western Alaska LCC funded project to inventory, store, and display metadata for stream temperature monitoring efforts through the Alaska Online Aquatic Temperature site. Prior to the workshop, the project team developed a semi-structured questionnaire that assessed current data management practices among the stakeholders, their capacity for data management, and the desired capabilities of a data storage and management website. The workshop was used to discuss the results of this survey, assess other stream temperature efforts for application in Alaska, and explore best data management practices to ensure long term sustainability of stream temperature data.   The 2015 workshop helped to establish that the stakeholders and science-users in Alaska need an assessment of existing websites that provide various components of data management for stream temperature. The project team is working on this assessment and is also developing a HUC-8 prioritization strategy for stream temperature data collection for the entire state of Alaska based on existing instrumentation and other relevant parameters.

Persistent drought is further affecting agricultural production in the RMI. Many Marshallese communities are already experiencing these changes and are migrating to larger islands within the RMI and to other countries like the U.S. to, among other things, seek alternative means of making a living and access healthcare.  The number of Marshallese residing in the U.S. has rapidly risen over the past two decades, from 7,000 in 2000 to 22,000 in 2010. There is also substantial internal migration, mainly from outer islands to the main atoll of Majuro. However, we do not know to what extent Marshallese people are already migrating because of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services\u2014nor do we know whether this migration can be regarded as a successful adaptation strategy. The factors triggering human migration are complex and often intertwined, making it difficult to pinpoint and address specific causes from a public policy perspective. For example, changes in ecosystems due to climate change can cause health problems or food insecurity, which may have greater consequences in communities with political, social, or economic tension. Decision makers at local and state levels in both the RMI and U.S.\u2014for example those who design policy related to immigrant access to services\u2014need information to better understand the factors contributing to current migration and to anticipate possible future impacts of climate on human migration. Also, a better understanding is needed of how migration impacts livelihoods and well being in the island to which migrants arrive and in the areas in which they settle.  This research project will study the nature of Marshallese migration and its effects on migrants, themselves, and communities in source and destination areas. There are three central research questions:    \tTo what extent are climatic stressors, and their impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods and habitability, already driving migration in RMI? \tWhat are the impacts of migration in source and destinations areas? \tHow do migration reasons and consequences vary among different types of respondents?

To provide a proof of concept of the value of scenario planning in helping managers prepare for climate change, we conducted a pilot scenario planning effort aimed at helping state agencies in the northeastern United States develop climate-informed moose management goals and actions.  To encourage participation by wildlife managers, we provided several opportunities for them to learn about scenario planning and examples of its application in natural resource management. We shared this information via guidance documents on incorporating climate change into State Wildlife Action Plans, organized sessions at professional conferences, on-line presentations, periodic project newsletters, and small group meetings with state wildlife managers. These educational efforts reached well over 50 managers across the northeast and other parts of the country, and were successful in building interest in scenario planning. In September 2016, we partnered with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NY-DEC) to lead a 1-day scenario planning exercise focused on setting goals and objectives for a state-wide moose management plan. WCS then worked closely with scientists at the Northeast Climate Science Center to develop a set of future climate scenarios that are directly relevant to examining how the draft moose populations goals and objectives developed during the first workshop might hold up under different scenarios of climate change. These scenarios will be used by NY-DEC in Spring 2017 when they take their next steps to prepare a moose management plan for the state.

We sought insights by examining Lake Erie as a representative system with a high level of anthropogenic impacts, strong nutrient gradients, seasonal hypoxia, and spatial overlap of cold- and cool-water fish guilds. In Lake Erie and in large embayments throughout the Great Lakes basin, this situation is a concern for fishery managers, as climate change may exacerbate hypoxia and reduce habitat volume for some species. We examined fish community composition, fine-scale distribution, prey availability, diets, and biochemical tracers for dominant fishes from study areas with medium-high nutrient levels (mesotrophic, Fairport study area), and low nutrient levels (oligotrophic, Erie study area). This multi-year database (2011-2013) provides the ability to contrast years with wide variation in rainfall, winter ice-cover, and thermal stratification. In addition, multiple indicators of dietary and distributional responses to environmental variability will allow resource managers to select the most informative approach for addressing specific climate change questions.  Our results support the incorporation of some relatively simple and cost-efficient approaches into existing agency monitoring programs to track the near-term condition status of fish and fish community composition by functional groupings. Other metrics appear better suited for understanding longer-term changes, and may take more resources to implement on an ongoing basis. Although we hypothesized that dietary overlap and similarity in selected species would be sharply different during thermal stratification and hypoxic episodes, we found little evidence of this. Instead, to our surprise, this study found that fish tended to aggregate at the edges of hypoxia, highlighting potential spatial changes in catch efficiency of the fishery.  This work has had several positive impacts on a wide range of resource management and stakeholder activities, most notably in Lake Erie. The results were instrumental in the development of an interim decision rule for dealing with data collected during hypoxic events to improve stock assessment of Yellow Perch. In addition, novel findings from this study regarding spatial and temporal variability in hypoxia have aided US-Environmental Protection Agency in the development of a modified sampling protocol to more accurately quantify the central basin hypoxic zone, and this directly addressed a goal of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 2012 to reduce the extent and severity of hypoxia. Finally, the study areas developed in this project formed the basis for food web sampling in the 2014 bi-national Coordinated Science and Monitoring Initiative work in Lake Erie.

Not only has this translated into a longer fire season, but reduced snowpack has cascading effects that impact streamflow, water supplies, agricultural productivity, and ecosystems. California receives 80% of its precipitation during the winter, so mountain snowpack plays a critical role in replenishing the state\u2019s water supply.   One factor that affects the amount of winter precipitation (and therefore snowpack) in California is the North Pacific Jet (NPJ)\u2014a current of strong, high altitude winds that occur over the northern Pacific Ocean. Winters when the NPJ is located further north than normal are drier than average in California, while winters when the NPJ is located further south are wetter. Climate change is expected to cause the position of the NPJ to become more variable, which could greatly influence California\u2019s water resources and ecosystems.   The goal of this project is to identify the relationship between the NPJ and wildfires in California. Researchers will first use tree-ring data to examine variability in the position of the NPJ over the past 400+ years to identify historical trends. They will then use historical fire data to determine how the NPJ has influenced wildfire patterns in the past. Finally, researchers will look at recent fire data to see if this historical relationship between the NPJ and fire holds true in the 21 st century.   By documenting the relationship between the NPJ and wildfires, this project will enable fire managers to better forecast future fire conditions, based on projected trends in the NPJ.

These changes have direct implications for economically important wildlife, such as deer and waterfowl. Deer hunting alone contributes $482 million annually to Wisconsin\u2019s economy.   The goal of this project is to identify how winter severity, snowpack, and lake ice could change through the mid- and late-21st century, and how species such as the white-tailed deer and mallard duck will respond. Because currently available climate data is at too coarse a scale to provide information on future conditions for the Great Lakes, researchers transformed these models from a global-scale to a regional-scale.    Using these models, researchers found that the region could experience substantial warming, reduced lake ice cover, and increased precipitation, with more precipitation falling as rain than snow, among other changes. Snow/ice cover limit foraging by waterfowl, thereby regulating the timing/intensity of migration and their distributions during non-breeding season. Reductions in weather severity could result in delayed autumn-winter migration for dabbling ducks, which would increase foraging pressures on wetlands in the Great Lakes region \u2013 highlighting the importance of protecting these wetlands. These changes in migration patterns could also lead to potentially significant economic losses in southern flyway states, as ducks may stay in the Great Lakes region during the winter months. The primary wintertime stressors for deer are air chill and snow depth, with extreme winters triggering population declines.  Changes in wildlife abundance and distribution can incur dramatic ecological, societal, and economic impacts. Warming may support expanded deer populations and overgrazing, while elevating infectious disease threats to deer. Annually in the U.S., 13.4 million people participate in deer and migratory bird hunting, generating $21.5 billion in revenue, with the hunting industry supporting 681,000 jobs.

Of further concern is the fact that drought conditions resulting from climate change could exacerbate existing water allocation issues in the region.   Researchers are examining the potential impacts of drought on wetland-dependent migratory waterbirds in the Central Valley and interior basins. First, researchers are identifying plausible future habitat scenarios, based on potential changes to climate and possible water allocation decisions that could be made in the two regions, and are determining what these scenarios would mean for waterbirds. Researchers are also modeling how habitat conditions affect bird populations, in order to uncover how projected changes to habitat could influence the long-term survival of waterbirds. Finally, researchers will create a decision-support tool communicating the potential effects of climate change on waterbirds to conservation planners.  The most pressing conservation issues in the Central Valley and interior basins are climate change and ongoing conflicts surrounding water allocation. This study addresses a need to understand the impacts of drought and water allocation policies in the regions on wetlands and the waterbirds that depend on them.

We found that newer plans scored higher than older plans, suggesting agencies may be learning to develop better plans over time and indicating older plans should be prioritized for revision. Plans from federal and state agencies scored higher than plans from non-governmental agencies, reflecting differences in agency missions and resources. The fact base scored high across most plans, whereas actions and implementation scored lower. Although agencies tended to perform best on fact base, our results suggest having a strong fact base has little influence on other components. To improve actions and implementation, planners should consider incorporating more stakeholder participation to help them develop better actions and implementation indirectly through improved problem and objective statements.  We also investigated how decisions were being made and what barriers - if any - faced decision makers. To gain this insight, we conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with key decision makers and stakeholders and our findings emphasized the challenge of collaboration between individuals, governmental, and non-governmental organizations. We found discrepancies between groups on everything from objectives and goals, to how decisions are made, the barriers groups are facing, information that is used to make those decisions and where information comes from as well as differences in decision making timing and frequency. Agency managers had firm objectives while landowners/private land managers had flexible objectives that changed based on new goals, knowledge and information. In the same vein, agency managers said it was hard to change their management plans but landowners/private land managers said that their management plans were constantly changing to meet their shifting objectives. Agency managers reported that they had access to all of the information they needed to make \u201cgood\u201d decisions while landowners/private managers said that they wanted and needed more information, specifically better economic and growth data. And although agency managers said climate change was a factor when making decisions, landowners/private land managers said that climate change was not a decision making factor. To bridge the gap between the two groups and increase information sharing, a library of regulatory requirements, scientific data, personal experiences and fiscal information may be a way to align management objectives and goals.  Lastly, we developed a questionnaire that may be used in future research projects to evaluate how socio-structural drivers and the personas of decision makers influence their decision making.

This integrated method will produce more accurate estimates of future sagebrush distribution and abundance.   The results of this research will be effectively communicated to land managers so that they can inform conservation planning, and sage-grouse management in particular, across the Intermountain West.

The Gulf of Maine population began to decline significantly by the late 19th century, leading to the closure of the commercial Atlantic salmon fishery in 1948. In recent years, populations have again begun to decrease again. State and federal fisheries biologists are concerned that climate-related changes in streamflow and temperature could impact salmon survival in these rivers. Projections of future climate conditions for the Northeast indicate warming air temperatures, earlier snowmelt runoff, and decreases in streamflow during the low flow period (summer). In the spring, snow melts in the Northeast and recharges groundwater supplies. As climate conditions change, snow is melting earlier, resulting in longer periods of low streamflow in summer. These changes are of concern because this period is critical in the Atlantic salmon life cycle.   The goal of this project was to investigate changes in summer low streamflow and stream temperatures to identify how endangered Atlantic salmon populations might be affected by these changes. Researchers assessed past changes in groundwater discharge to rivers in the Gulf of Maine using historical flow data and estimated future streamflow, temperature, and groundwater discharge during summer low-flow periods using climate-model data and detailed watershed models.   A main result of this work was the development of a watershed model for four rivers in Maine that provide important habitat for Atlantic salmon: The Pleasant, Narraguagus, Sheepscot, and Royal Rivers. Researchers developed models of these river basins that provide daily streamflow, which enables managers to characterize the timing and quantity of water moving through each basin. This information can then be used to test how different streamflow and water temperature conditions might impact salmon.

Known as phenology, the timing of these events is very sensitive to changes in climate (and changes in one species\u2019 phenology can impact entire food webs and ecosystems). Shifts in phenology have been described as a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the temporal and spatial responses of wildlife to climate change impacts. Thus phenology provides one of the strongest indicators of the adaptive capacity of organisms (or the ability of organisms to cope with future environmental conditions).  In this study, researchers are exploring how the timing and occurrence of a number of highly migratory marine animals is changing due to a series of climatic and ecological shifts. First, using existing long-term historical data series, they will determine the direction and magnitude of how migration, abundance, or other phenological factors have changed for marine mammals, sea turtles, and fishes that migrate into the Gulf of Maine on a seasonal basis. Because marine animals are inherently difficult to detect, the team will apply dynamic occupancy models to evaluate seasonal migration patterns and habitat use across multiple habitats in the Gulf of Maine region. The project team will also synthesize regional information on a key, ecologically-important prey fish, sandlance, whose timing and abundance is a strong predictor of the occurrence and behavior of predator species targeted in this study as well as a range of other regional fish and wildlife of conservation and management concern. Results from this component of the project will identify coastal fish and wildlife species that are relatively more or less able to adapt and thus potentially vulnerable to climate change; determine the likely primary drivers of those changes; and identify data gaps and future monitoring needs. Ultimately, this information will be available and useful for regional coastal management and adaptation decisions that will allow managers to effectively plan for the future.   In a second component of the project, researchers will focus specifically on changes in migration patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale. While shifts in the distribution and time of recurring life events are adaptive responses that may help species cope with climate impacts, they can also lead to changes in how species interact with humans. The North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered whale species on the planet. In the North Atlantic Ocean, ship strikes and entanglements with commercial fishing gear represent fatal threats to right whales. Recent reports suggest that North Atlantic right whale migration patterns have changed. Many researchers posit that shifts in migration are responsible for recent increases in the overlap between right whales and human activities, especially fishing. To help understand how changes in right whale movements and behaviors may overlap with ship traffic, and thus put the animals at risk of encountering vessels, we will combine right whale habitat models with ship traffic maps.

Scientists at the USGS, academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) examined the linkages between climate, hydrology, and the biological factors that influence riparian and wetland ecosystem resilience and migratory bird communities. To this end, we (1) collectively developed a synthesis document exploring the linkages between the myriad of elements determining climate change effects on bird communities and communicated this state-of-knowledge to wildlife managers; (2) downscaled data using statistical and dynamical approaches that produce ensemble climate models; (3) developed models to forecast climate effects on water and biological outcomes on wetlands in the northern Great Plains; (4) developed models that relate climate predictions to snowmelt timing, stream flow, water management, and the phenology and growth of native and invasive riparian plants, (5) predicted migrant bird responses to changes in phenology and habitats; and (6) examine the role of phenotypic plasticity in avian responses to climate change. By exploring the effects of altered climate and habitat conditions on riparian-dependent birds using a holistic approach that incorporates both top-down and bottom-up constraints, we can better predict changes in riparian ecosystems and responses of migratory birds to those changes.

Not least among those uncertainties are questions regarding future climate conditions. Technological advancements have enhanced our ability to understand and model climate, which has led to improved climate forecasting capabilities. However, climate projections are usually produced at a global scale, which makes them impractical for natural resource managers who are concerned with how climate will change in the specific location or region in which they operate. While there have been a growing number of techniques for increasing the resolution of these projections, resource managers are given little guidance on how to choose the best method or model to meet their needs.   This project will provide managers with much needed guidance on how to navigate the range of available modeling methods, and to identify situations in which these climate models will be most useful. For example, managers could invest in improving modeling techniques to achieve a more specific understanding of future climate conditions, but this investment may not yield the desired results, and resources may be better spent elsewhere. This project will help natural resource managers understand the types of information that can plausibly be gained from climate projections, how to use climate models to inform management decisions, and how to best utilize available climate information to meet their needs while coping with uncertainty.

The majority of the land in these states is held by state, federal and tribal entities; and environmental changes pose challenges to the management of these public and tribal lands across the region. Assessing and addressing the information needs of federal, state, and tribal resource managers is a critical part of helping these decision-makers manage risk and adapt to these changes. Identification and evaluation of existing barriers and opportunities for knowledge exchange between scientists and managers within the region is an important step toward building effective adaptation networks. This requires knowledge sharing at a level that has not previously existed, particularly in the Interior Southwest.  To help close these existing information gaps, this project aims to develop and conduct the next generation of scientific assessments that will improve the ability of natural resource managers to use critical scientific information for climate adaptation. The main focal areas of the project include providing 1) recommendations for best practices for integrating science into natural resource management, 2) the information needed to allow managers to prepare in advance for extreme events, and 3) enhanced opportunities for knowledge exchange between scientists and managers. The Southwest CASC is partnering with the Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions at the University of Arizona to organize a working group of scientists and resource managers that will design and implement a regional adaptation and science assessment network. Once established, this network will work to synthesize existing knowledge and evaluate information needs on priority management topics.

To better understand these links, project researchers implemented two computer-based numeric models in the Cleve Creek watershed in the Schell Creek Range, east of Ely, Nevada. The application of the two models to study the hydrologic and ecological processes in the watershed allows us to look forward in time over a range of possible scenarios to predict future water availability under simulated climate variability.

Our ability to manage sustainable fish, shellfish and other wildlife populations in the future will be seriously compromised unless we have a basic understanding of the coming changes and use this to develop mitigation and adaptation measures. The overall objective of this multi-agency research is to develop the baseline climatic and biological data, models, and tools to predict the cumulative impact of climate change on habitats and ecosystem services in a series of coastal estuaries of the Pacific Northwest. In collaboration with other federal, state, and non-governmental organization partners, USGS scientists developed predictions of climate-related alterations of the distribution and abundance of oysters and seagrass, both of which provide critical habitats that serve as nurseries for estuarine fishes and crabs. In addition, the project looked at climate impacts to tidal marsh, including effects on wetland restoration and juvenile salmon habitat. The research provides insights into future changes that impact wildlife and economically important species, and helps land managers understand the ramifications of the changes that are coming and what those changes may mean for both wildlife and the ecosystem services provided by these estuaries.

The scripts are written in the Python Language. Python is a freely-available, open-source scripting language that is object oriented and is supported by ArcGIS as a framework for creating and executing Geoprocessor tasks. Python also runs as a stand-alone programming language. The scripts were built using Python release 2.5.1, which is included with ESRI's ArcGIS 9.3.1. ArcGIS 9.3.x also supports Python version 2.5.4, but does not support later Python versions. Python is downloadable from http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.4/.  The PythonWin development environment provides a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for the python scripting editor. PythonWin is located in the \"Python for Windows extensions\" bundle available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/. To use the scripts provided, the user will need access to ArcGIS 9.x software and install the Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET). MGET is available at http://code.env.duke.edu/projects/mget. The first step involved in preparing HDF SDS files for conversion to ArcGIS GRID files (preceding use of the processing scripts) is a manual renaming of the files to conform to ArcGIS specifications; specifically, the rasters may have filenames no longer than 13 characters and must begin with a letter (they may not begin with a number or symbol). The original HDF filenames violate both of these rules. As file naming conventions are a personal preference, a name-converting script is not provided here. However, for clarity of the processing scripts provided, note that our file-naming convention is \"sstallyyyymm.hdf\" for SST rasters, and \"qualyyyymm.hdf\" for quality rasters (where y = year and m = month).  These scripts can be modified to the users' needs or run in sequence (as presented below) to obtain a similar dataset to those made available in this report. The point and polygon shapefile included in the data processing steps from the Associated Links located on this page. The scripts are available for download in zipped form located below.   \tSST_HDF2ArcRaster.py:  This script imports AVHRR Pathfinder SST data in HDF SDS format and converts them into georeferenced, scaled, SST rasters in ArcGIS GRID format with the help of the Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET). \tQual_HDF2ArcRaster.py:  This script imports AVHRR Pathfinder quality flag data in HDF SDS format and converts them into georeferenced, scaled, SST rasters in ArcGIS GRID format with the help of the Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET). \tCreateBSST.py:  This script uses the SST and Qual ArcGIS grids constructed with the \"SST_HDF2ArcRaster.py\" and \"Qual_HDF2ArcRaster.py\" scripts to apply a quality constraint to the SST data. \tNPac_ns_SST.py:  The purpose of this script is to clip the global SST grids to a nearshore region (20 km offshore) of the North Pacific Ocean. A clipping polygon shapefile, \"lowres_TNP_coast_Buffer.shp\" is provided below. \tNPac_ns_SST_pts.py:  This script uses the nearshore grids created with the \"NPac_ns_SST.py\" script.

For baseline climate condition variables, we used surface temperature and rainfall estimates (30 year baseline period, 1978\u20132007) developed by Giambelluca et al. (2013) with grid cell resolution of 250m. To estimate climate change responses, we used future projected climate variables developed by the International Pacific Research Center through dynamical downscaling of climate changes based on Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 3 (CMIP3) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B for end of century (based on Zhang et al. 2012). Plant species abundance models were developed using four baseline predictors with matching future projected climate variables: 1) simplified pioneer substrate (developed from geology maps by Price et al. (2012)) as a proxy for primary succession; 2) mean annual temperature (bio1); 3) wet season rainfall (bio18); and 4) dry season rainfall (bio19). Environmental variables were resampled to a consistent projection (WGS1984) with 250m grid cell resolution.    We examined data distribution and data gaps, and correlations between variables were assessed using a Pearson correlation coefficient. To estimate relative importance of predictors, we used species-specific response curves and variable importance plots. Individual model fit was assessed using residuals against fitted values plots, null and residual deviance values, and model comparisons using relative Akaike information criterion (AIC). We examined predictive performance of modeling approaches by first using 10 fold cross-validation then area under the curve (AUC) with an independent evaluation set.    Final models were built with a continuous second degree polynomial GLM model with second degree polynomial substrate variable removed, and no interactions. We used a 70/30 (train/test) random split using an evaluation data set that was independent of the training data, with 20 replicates. Multiple test statistics were used for validating model responses and a strong assessment of model performance. For final models in baseline climate conditions, we used AUC and Spearman rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1) values.&quot;", "item_url":

depicts projected abundance of native and non-native plant species in the main Hawaiian Islands with high levels of uncertainty removed in post-processing. To estimate native and invasive species abundance in baseline climate conditions, a map was generated that considered abundance as percent cover and used high coefficient of variation values as a mask. The primary sources for post-processing the uncertainty masks are the Hawaiian Islands plant species abundance modeled means and standard deviation values (Wong et al., in preparation). These maps cover the entire landscape (including urban and agricultural areas), and therefore they can be applied in a variety of ways. Maps can be utilized to evaluate baseline climate conditions for each species and to forecast changes to community structure through expected shifts in species abundance. Maps can be combined in order to predict community dominance, for example, by identifying the most abundant native species at a given location. This can be applied to: 1) spatial and temporal assessments of habitat quality and community structure comparisons; 2) defining specific ecological restoration objectives; and 3) identifying potential for key invasive species to threaten a site (even where they are presently not found). Future projected abundances can enhance conservation planning both by anticipating where native species may increase or decrease in abundance and by identifying areas where invasive species may extend their range. Combining this with assessments of relative response rates can aid managers in prioritizing native species to promote and invasive species to preemptively control at a given site. Purpose: These data were compiled to provide context from other data products (e.g., correlative species abundance model maps, standard deviation value maps, habitat quality maps, and species relative response characteristics) such that areas with high uncertainty were identified and removed from species abundance model maps developed by Wong et al. (in preparation). These post-processed maps contribute to an initial set of supporting tools for managers and decision makers. However, given the inconsistency of their statistical performance between evaluation metrics, some of these exploratory abundance maps should be used with caution and with reference to high levels of uncertainty. As is the case with other macro-scale correlative models, they should be applied to management at a conceptual, landscape scale rather than for detailed management at local sites.", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a", "item_phrases": ["temporal assessments", "conservation planning", "future projected abundances", "invasive species", "specific ecological restoration objectives", "standard deviation values", "non-native plant species", "entire landscape", "habitat quality maps", "key invasive species", "initial set", "standard deviation value maps", "agricultural areas", "decision makers", "correlative species abundance model maps", "species relative response characteristics", "uncertainty masks", "evaluation metrics", "local sites", "hawaiian islands plant species abundance", "community dominance", "main hawaiian islands", "landscape scale", "layer depicts", "invasive species abundance", "native species", "plant species abundance", "baseline climate conditions", "relative response rates", "variation values", "high uncertainty", "purpose", "abundant native species", "statistical performance", "estimate native", "relative response characteristics", "combining", "high levels", "wong", "high coefficient", "macro-scale correlative models", "community structure", "species abundance model maps", "wong et al.", "maps contribute", "exploratory abundance maps", "primary sources", "habitat quality", "data products", "maps", "community structure comparisons", "enhance conservation planning", "most abundant native species", "species abundance"], "weighted_sim": 0.5991, "avg_sim": 0.6156}, "55f9c6e3e4b05d6c4e501525": {"similarities": [], "item_summary": "", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55f9c6e3e4b05d6c4e501525", "item_phrases": [], "weighted_sim": 0, "avg_sim": 0}}}, "502bdd5fe4b098307cc38b67": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/502bdd5fe4b098307cc38b67", "proj_summary": "The goal of this project was to: (a) archive the relevant AR5 model output data for the southwest region; (b) downscale daily temperature and precipitation to 12 X 12 km cell spatial resolution over the Southwest; (c) assess the precision (degree of agreement) of the simulated models; (d) assess the direction and magnitude of change in projections between AR4 and AR5, as well as assess projections of key extreme climatic events (i.e., extreme drought, extreme seasonal precipitation, extreme high and low temperature events); and (e) assess critical ecosystem impacts (i.e., climate water deficit and fire; hydrological condition of major river systems; impacts on highly valued species).

Understanding how streamflow might change is instrumental not only for predicting changes in plant distribution and soil moisture, but also for infrastructure planning. Culvert replacement, bridge design, hydropower development, water reservoir placement, and floodplain restoration planning all require information on future trends in streamflow. Projections of peak flow, or the maximum flow of a stream, are particularly important for culvert and bridge engineering. Projections of low flow are more important for hydropower and fish habitat restoration planning.   The goal of this project is to improve projections of peak and low streamflow for small, ungaged watersheds in Southeast Alaska.

management of natural resources in response to climate change. The U.S. Northern Rockies still support a full suite of native wildlife, and survival of these populations depends on connected landscapes. Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action. We also encountered high levels of uncertainty in how climate change is expected to alter vegetation and how wildlife are expected to respond to these changes. This uncertainty limits the value of our assessment for informing proactive management of climate change impacts on both species-specific and biome-level connectivity (although biome-level assessments were subject to fewer sources of uncertainty). We offer suggestions for improving the management relevance of future studies based on our own insights and those of managers and biologists who participated in this assessment and provided critical review of this report. The purpose of these map layers is to portray our best estimates of the potential impacts of future climate-induced changes in vegetation on focal species habitat quality and major U.S. Northern Rockies biomes based on three available models projecting future vegetation, along with multiple sources of uncertainty surrounding these estimates.

Washington State is home to several threatened species of salmon and trout, including bull trout, and recovery plans for these fish include repairing or replacing culverts that currently block their passage. The state is currently looking to replace approximately 1,000 culverts at an estimated cost of $2.45 billion. As engineers re-design these culverts, which typically have a service life of 50-100 years, it will be important to consider how changing climate conditions will impact streams in the region. Climate change is projected to increase peak streamflows, and therefore widen stream channels, across much of Washington State over the course of the 21st century. Incorporating these climate change considerations into culvert removal and redesign will be key to ensuring the long-term resilience of those capital investments and the success of stream habitat restoration efforts.   The goal of this project is to support climate-resilient design for culvert and fish habitat restoration projects in Washington. Through collaboration with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), researchers will develop an interactive website that will provide the best available science on projections of future stream discharges and channel width for the state. These projections will be provided at the site level, and will also include estimates of the probability that a given culvert will fail to meet the design standard for fish passage during its service life. While WDFW has developed an internal tool to support climate-resilient culvert design, the tool needs to be updated to reflect the latest science.

One portion of the search dealt with an online literature search for published peer-reviewed articles for the period of approximately 2000 to present. The second portion of the search dealt with contacting US Geological Survey (USGS) Water Science Centers and state institutions to request information on current research projects dealing with this topic that have not yet been published or are currently in publication.

Coastal wetlands provide essential ecosystem services to people, including flood protection from high tides and storm surges, commercial fisheries, carbon sequestration, improved water quality, and wildlife food and habitat. Coastal wetlands are also home to hundreds of migratory and resident wildlife species including threatened and endangered species of management concern. Wetlands also have the unique ability to increase their elevation relative to sea-level rise, therefore protecting nearby communities from flooding. In California, prolonged drought and extreme storm events are projected to increase with climate change, and when coupled with sea-level rise, the impacts could be severe.  This project will leverage and analyze long-term biological and physical datasets as they relate to drought and extreme storm events to improve our understanding of how these events impact habitat persistence and resilience into the future. Specifically, this project will look at storms and warm ocean temperatures related to El Ni\u00f1o and the 2016 and 2017 Atmospheric River storms which resulted in record breaking floods throughout California. In addition this project will investigate how drought conditions since 2012 changed the function of the coastal wetland system.

These methods also help to eliminate long gaps in data that can allow smoothing algorithms to interpolate beyond the valid range of data (in the case of NDVI from 0 \u20131):Annual minimum NDVI values that were labeled as high-quality were identified in the 13 year time-series.The bottom first percentileof a distribution of minimum values was used as the \u201cbackground\u201dvalue to fill-in missing values when the target was identified as being under snow cover.All NDVI values identified by pixel-reliability grids as being of high or marginal quality werepreserved and snow-covered pixels and dates were filled in with each pixels \u201cbackground\u201dvalue.Composite day of year grids were used to identify the actual date from which the 16-day maximum composite NDVI value came.Each pixel\u2019s entire time-series (2000 \u20132012) was smoothed in a weighted regression framework against time using smoothing splines (Chambers and Hastie 1992). NDVI data of marginal quality and snow-covered background values contributed half the weight to final smoothed values as did high-quality values. The final smoothed values were used to interpolate the time-series to a daily time-step and to record annual NDVI amplitudes. Land surface phenology metrics were calculated as follows:Start of season (SOS) \u2013the first annual day of year when smoothed NDVI crosses half of its annual amplitude (White et al. 2009).End of Season (EOS) \u2013the last day of year when smoothed NDVI crosses half of its annual amplitude.Maximum annual NDVI (MAX) \u2013the highest annual smoothed NDVITiming of annual maximum (DOYMAX) \u2013the smoothed day of year when NDVI reaches its maximum valueEstimated annual productivity (INDVI) \u2013the integrated area under the growing season (SOS to EOS) NDVI curve (Goward et al 1985).

In Hawai\u02bfi, efforts to conserve native forests have come into conflict with objectives to sustain non-native game mammals, such as feral pigs, goats, and deer, for subsistence and sport hunting. Maintaining stable or increasing game populations represents one of the greatest obstacles to the recovery of Hawaii\u2019s 425 threatened and endangered plant species. Many endemic Hawaiian species have declined and become endangered as a result of herbivorous non-native game mammals. Meanwhile, other environmental changes, including the spread of invasive grasses and changing precipitation patterns and wildfire regimes could further interact to alter the distribution and range of native plants.   This project will address the need to optimally balance long-term endangered plant recovery with non-native game management. Focusing on the islands of Maui and L\u0101na\u02bfi, researchers will map the distribution of game species and native plant species, then use these maps to identify zones that would be optimal for plant conservation, and others for game management.

Unfortunately, many of these ecosystems are increasingly under threat due to rapid human development, and management agencies are increasingly aware of the potential effects that climate change will have on these ecosystems. Natural resource managers and conservation planners can be effective at preserving ecosystems in the face of these stressors only if they can adapt current conservation efforts to increase the overall resilience of the system. Climate change, in particular, challenges many of the basic assumptions used by conservation planners and managers. Previous conservation planning efforts identified and prioritized areas for conservation based on the current environmental conditions, such as habitat quality, and assumed that conditions in conservation lands would be largely controlled by management actions (including no action). Climate change, however, will likely alter important system drivers (temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise) and make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain recent historic conditions in conservation lands into the future. Climate change will also influence the future conservation potential of non-conservation lands, further complicating conservation planning.

Tree mortality is one means of measuring the severity of a fire, and evidence shows that trees exposed to drought conditions for periods of 5-10 years are already more sensitive to the effects of fire \u2013 suggesting that drought could indeed increase fire severity.

Currently, scientists and resource managers often find it difficult to use downscaled climate projections because of the multiple methodologies used to produce them and the time-consuming process required to obtain model output. In response, the research team implemented a three-part plan to provide high resolution climate data for the impact modeling community. First, a database was developed of up-to-date and state-of-the-art downscaled climate projections for the U.S., using a range of plausible future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Second, a series of workshops were held to solicit input about climate-related data needs and to discuss best practices for accessing and using downscaled climate projections. Finally, downscaled projections were made available as an enterprise-level web-based source. Users are able to freely access the data via an interactive, easily manageable interface, in formats which are familiar to ecosystem and impact modelers. The climate dataset was generated by applying advanced statistical downscaling methods to a comprehensive selection of global climate model simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment (IPCC AR4) database, with the capability of rapidly updating results as new climate model output becomes available. The workshops involved key stakeholders from the USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC) modeling community and decision-makers and managers from the USGS and our partnering Department of the Interior agencies, such as the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service. This project: (1) allows for consistent impact assessments at the scale of the most critical ecosystem processes through downscaling projections of daily temperature and precipitation across the continental U.S.; (2) enables scientists and managers to easily access, manipulate and download data relevant to modeling climate change impacts on ecosystems through a common web-based data portal; and (3) explores ways to reduce redundant efforts to obtain and produce downscaled climate projections by soliciting feedback from the NCCWSC research community. Most importantly, this work enables impact assessments to be based on the same common data set, allowing researchers and resource managers to compare results and projections across regions and ecosystems.

The Northern Rocky Mountain region is home to some of the last remaining interconnected habitats for many native fishes, including the threatened bull trout and native westslope cutthroat trout. The Northern Rockies are also experiencing rapidly changing climate conditions, with temperatures rising at twice the global average. These changes are having a range of impacts on aquatic ecosystems, including warming stream temperatures and changing streamflow regimes. This region is also experiencing a rise in the expansion of alien invasive fish species, which further threaten ecologically and economically valuable cold-water fish like trout and char.   The expansion of invasive species directly threatens regional economies, including Montana\u2019s recreational fishing industry, which brings an estimated $1 billion to the state\u2019s economy each year. Despite the implications of these shifts in fish communities, our understanding of how changes in climate might be facilitating the expansion of invasive species is limited, thereby restricting proactive resource management. So far, such expansion has led to observable differences in the productivity and biodiversity of fisheries across the Northern Rocky Mountains. Fisheries managers are increasingly aware of this problem and are faced with the difficult task of weighing trade-offs between preserving cold-water fisheries, and thereby aiding the conservation of native species, or shifting to recreational or warm-water fisheries, which are often comprised of non-native fish that can harm surrounding ecosystems but may also maintain the region\u2019s prized fishing industry.

For example, because climate change may alter the frequency, duration, or severity of droughts, small habitats that naturally retain water (drought refugia) may become increasingly important to many natural wildlife communities.  Although several approaches have been suggested for identifying climate refugia, large-scale mapping and evaluation of refugia have not yet been conducted in the Pacific Northwest. To address this information gap, researchers used existing information on hydrology, soil characteristics, topography etc. to map areas of refugia that can protect wildlife from regional changes in temperature and precipitation.

This analysis involved several steps. First, time-series climate data were compiled and plotted to identify drought periods. Similarly, time-series data representing insect outbreaks were compiled and plotted to identify trends in insect mortality. The study area was classified into forest canopy types using existing modeled estimates of tree basal area by tree species. Using remotely-sensed Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) from the Landsat archive, NDMI anomalies from reference conditions were calculated in 2001 and 2009. Based on these anomalies, and using the forest classification map, refugia from drought (in 2001) and combined drought-MPB effects (in 2009) were identified as NDMI anomalies greater than the 90th-percentile value within each forest type. Once refugia had been identified, landscape variables (topographic, soil, and forest stand characteristics) were compiled and used to model the landscape controls on refugia locations using Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) modeling, a machine-learning algorithm.

The processing scripts and data products presented here are intended to accompany and support a peer-reviewed journal article (in preparation) documenting the identification of refugia from drought and mountain pine beetle in a whitebark and lodgepole pine ecosystem. Drought and insect outbreaks are two primary disturbance processes linking climate change to tree mortality in western North America. Climate-change refugia are landscape locations that may be buffered against detrimental ecological effects of climate change and thus may be priorities for conservation, monitoring, and restoration. Knowledge of physiological effects of drought and mountain pine beetle attack  combined with recent advances in understanding landscape drivers of microenvironmental conditions (e.g. spatial patterns in soil moisture) can be used to develop a set of hypotheses for where refugia may occur.

While this is an important finding, this previous research did not take into account the important role that melting snow, ice, and frozen ground (permafrost) play in replenshing soil moisture in the spring and summer months.   This project will address this gap in the characterization of fire risk using the newly developed monthly water balance model (MWBM). The MWBM takes into account rain, snow, snowmelt, glacier ice melt, and the permafrost layer to better calculate soil moisture replenishment and the amount of moisture that is lost to the atmosphere (evapotranspiration). Using this model, researchers will be able to refine the boundaries of fire-prone areas in Alaska, based on which areas are prone to particularly high moisture deficit and summer temperatures. Maps will be created that identify which regions of the state currently have a high risk of wildfire, as well as which regions can expect to have an elevated risk of fire in the future to support adaptation planning. This research will also have broad applicability to other regions of the country facing uncertainty about future wildfire risk.

In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands, where the ocean meets the land, are highly productive areas that support a wealth of wildlife species from salmon to ducks. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. However, wetlands in this region and elsewhere are threatened by sea-level rise and other climate-related changes. According to a USFWS and NOAA report, between 2004 and 2009, 80,000 acres of wetland were lost on average each year, which is a significant increase from the previous six years.  While we know that these coastal ecosystems are already changing, we know comparatively less about how these areas might continue to change over the next 50 to 100 years. The goal of this project was to provide scientific information that will support long-term coastal planning and conservation efforts in the face of changing climate conditions. Researchers looked at the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon. They compiled data on coastal terrain, tidal flooding, vegetation, and how quickly sediments accumulate, to assess how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Researchers found that factors such as elevation, sediments, and rate of sea-level rise can all affect marsh resilience. Importantly, researchers found that while most of the tidal marsh study sites will be able to persist in the face of sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, sea-level rise could eventually outpace the growth of marshes and drown most high and mid-elevation marsh habitats by 2110.", "proj_phrases": ["productive areas", "sea-level rise", "support long-term coastal planning", "researchers",

conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon. We performed bathymetric surveys using a shallow-water echo-sounding system comprised of an acoustic profiler, Leica Viva RTK GPS, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat. The RTK GPS enabled high resolution elevations of the water surface. The rover positions were received from the Leica Smartnet system (www.lecia-geosystems.com) or base station and referenced to the same bench mark used in the elevation surveys. We mounted a variable frequency transducer on the front of the boat and connected it to the sounder; the sounder worked in areas of &gt;10 cm of water. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. The bar-check plate was suspended below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. We synthesized the bathymetry data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) of the nearshore regions at Port Susan, Skokomish, Nisqually, Grays Harbor, Willapa, and Bull Island using ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size). We removed portions of bathymetry data that overlapped with elevation surveys conducted on the tidal marsh. We present elevation data as local orthometric heights (NAVD88). At Padilla we mapped the nearshore area using the methodologies outlined in the project report as the dense eelgrass beds would have increased the error in acoustic measurements At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon).

(1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenariosIn WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Csdating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms,at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1.Organic matterWe used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort.Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Bandon marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 63 cm sea-level rise rate. In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5af4cc2ce4b0da30c1b44f6b", "item_phrases": ["morris", "vegetation structure", "callaway", "morris et al.",

survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) surveys between 2009 and 2014 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).The feature class contains elevation surveys conducted at the CERCC Bandon marsh study site. At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions.

(~25% of the elevation points) (Figure 5). We visually assessed percent cover of all plant species within a 0.25 m2 quadrat, and recorded the average and maximum height (measured to the nearest centimeter) of each species. Total plant cover in a plot could exceed 100% due to vegetation layering. Vascular plant nomenclature generally follows Baldwin et al. (2012) and Cook et al. (2013). We located 69 tidal wetland species in 2,154 vegetation plots across the nine estuaries in the study. Common species included Carex lyngbyei, Sarcocornia perennis, Distichlis spicata, Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus balticus and Potentilla anserina. The frequency of several common species varied markedly across the sites. Distichlis spicata dominated the flora at five of the nine sites, but was relatively uncommon at Port Susan and Grays Harbor. Deschampsia cespitosa, a middle to high marsh tussock-forming species was frequent at the three Oregon sites and at Willapa but much less common in Puget Sound marshes. The high marsh rush, Juncus balticus, was most frequent at Siletz and absent or rare at Willapa and Padilla. Carex lyngbyei occurrence was variable regionally, ranging from &gt;75% frequency at Bull Island to near absence at Padilla (it did not occur in any surveyed plots, but a few plants were observed at the upland margin of the site in late 2014). See appendices for detailed site specific results. We delineated marsh zones using long-term NOAA tidal data combined with our site-specific elevation and water level data and examined plant abundance in these major zones across the sites. At many sites, plant composition tended to vary by zone, but not necessarily in consistent ways across the region. For instance, at Bandon, Sarcocornia perennis was the most abundant high marsh species (with Deschampsia cespitosa most abundant in middle and low marsh), while S. perennis was the most abundant plant in low marsh at Grays Harbor (Carex spp. dominated in mid-marsh and Potentilla anserina dominated high marsh). Vertical zonation of plant assemblages was less pronounced at other sites, including Nisqually where Distichlis spicata had the highest mean cover in all three major marsh zones. Low marsh habitat was common at Bull Island, Willapa, Nisqually, and Port Susan. Common species in this zone included Sarcocornia perennis, Distichlis spicata, Carex lyngbyei, and Triglochin maritima. Middle tidal marsh was present at all of the sites and particularly common at Skokomish. Common species included all of the aforementioned taxa and Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus balticus, and Agrostis stolonifera. High marsh was only common at Bandon, Siletz, Willapa, Grays Harbor, and Padilla. Common high marsh species included many species found in other zones, but also included Potentilla anserine and Atriplex prostrata. Transition zone habitat (defined as wetland flooding at least once per year but no more than once per month) was limited at most of our study sites. Zonation of individual species per site are illustrated in the respective appendices. In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55b2db24e4b09a3b01b5d9da", "item_phrases": ["carex lyngbyei occurrence", "vegetation structure", "shallow

study sites we conducted survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) surveys between 2009 and 2014 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).In ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013, Redlands, CA), we created a digital elevation model (DEM) for each site using each sites survey elevation data points. We processed the elevation point data with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size) while adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square (RMS) error to create the best model fit for the DEM (Table 2). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones. At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions.

site-specific tidal datums, we deployed water level data loggers (Model 3001, Solinst Canada Ltd., Georgetown, Ontario, Canada and Model U-20-001-01-Ti, Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA, USA) at all sites over the study period. Each site had one or two loggers (n = 16). We placed loggers at the mouth and upper reaches of second-order tidal channels to capture high tides and determine seasonal inundation patterns. Water loggers collected water level readings every six minutes starting on the date of deployment and continuing to the present. We used data from the lowest elevation logger at each site to develop local hydrographs and inundation rates. We surveyed loggers with RTK GPS at the time of deployment and at each data download that occurred quarterly, to correct for any vertical movement. We corrected all raw water level data with local time series of barometric pressure. For Solinst loggers, we deployed independent barometric loggers (Model 3001, Solinst Canada Ltd., Georgetown, Ontario, Canada); for Hobo water level loggers, we used barometric pressure from local airports (distance less than 10 miles). To determine tidal channel salinities, we deployed one conductivity logger at each site next to the lower elevation water level logger (Odyssey conductivity/temperature logger, Dataflow Systems Pty Limited, Christchurch, New Zealand). We converted specific conductance values obtained with the Odyssey loggers to practical salinity units using the equation from UNESCO (1983). We used water level data to estimate local tidal datums for all sites using procedures outlined in the NOAA Tidal Datums Handbook (NOAA, 2003). We only calculated local MHW and MHHW because the loggers were positioned in the intertidal, which is relatively high in the tidal frame, and therefore did not capture MLW or MLLW and could not be used to compute these lower datums. We estimated mean tide level (MTL) for each site by using NOAA\u2019s VDATUM 3.4 software (vdatum.noaa.gov), except at Bandon where we used MTL directly from historic NOAA data. Many results in this report are reported relative to local MHHW calculated from local water data. Water level loggers deployed within marsh channels recorded variation in water levels and salinity throughout the study duration. Loggers often did not capture lower portions of the tidal curve because of their location in tidal marsh channels which frequently drain at lower tides. From peak water levels, we calculated site-specific tidal datums (MHW and MHHW), and information on the highest observed water level (HOWL) during the time series. Our site specific tidal datum calculations generally closely matched tidal datums computed at nearby NOAA stations (tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). Differences likely reflect site-specific tidal and bathymetric conditions in local estuarine hydrology. We collected salinity data at all sites, however, due to equipment recalls and failure we do not have salinity data for the duration of the study. We report weekly maximum salinities since many of our salinity loggers were not submerged during the entire tidal cycle at all sites, except for Grays Harbor due to recalled loggers and loggers being washed away during storm events. We observed a high level of variation in salinity between and within sites. Siletz experienced the greatest variation in salinity during the study period, ranging from 0.8 to 32 ppt. Willapa was the freshest system, ranging from 12-15 ppt and had very little temporal variation. The largest variation in salinity at most sites occurred from September through December. All sites had salinity below 35 ppt throughout most of the year; however, the highest salinities were measured in August. See appendices for detailed site specific results. At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast.

measured historic rates of mineral and organic matter accumulation at each site by collecting deep soil cores with a Russian peat borer.

Two replicate cores were sampled from each station for a total of 6 cores per site (except Coos Bay where 7 cores were taken). Coring locations were determined by RTK GPS elevation and tidal inundation data. Transects for core sampling were determined in ArcGIS, using a digitial elevation model and site-specific tidal datums to choose station locations below MHW (low), between MHW and MHHW (mid), and above MHHW (high). Sediment cores were 50 cm deep and 5 cm in diameter. In the lab, we cut cores into 1 cm sections to process for bulk density, porosity, and organic matter composition using loss on ignition in a muffle furnace at 550&ordm;C for 8 hr. Only half of the cores collected were processed for bulk density, organic matter and Cesuim dating (one replicate). We used Cesium-137 (137Cs) isotope dating techniques to determine accumulation rates in deep soil cores. Atmospheric nuclear testing prior to 1964 resulted in the spread of 137Cs across the globe creating a reliable marker horizon in soils. We used a gamma spectrometer at the Oregon State University Radiation Center to detect 137Cs activity, measured in picocuries (pCi), in 1 cm core samples for 24 hr. We standardized the 137Cs activity of each sample to its mass. The depth of the 137Cs peak activity indicated the 1964 marker horizon, which we used to determine average soil accretion rates over the last half century.

The Yurok Tribe maintains stewardship responsibility for their Ancestral Lands, which include the Yurok Reservation, and is concerned about the potential impacts of climate change on culturally significant species and the ecosystems that support them.   This project had two broad objectives: The first was to meet the needs of the Yurok Tribe in collecting traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) to identify priority areas and activities for helping the Tribe plan for and respond to climate change. The second objective was to provide a culturally appropriate model for how tribes and non-tribal entities (including federal agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) could collect, document, and integrate TEK into decision making. TEK is often proprietary, culturally sensitive, and privileged information, even within a tribal community. Researchers sought to develop a process that would protect the confidentiality and intellectual property rights of community members to preserve the integrity of the information and wisdom involved and to reinforce the responsibility of those who possess and share it.   Researchers conducted structured interviews with elders from the Yurok Tribe and used ethnographic methods to analyze the results. From this analysis, several general themes emerged. For example, Yurok elders have a good understanding of how the environment has changed over the last 200 years. They identified numerous species, including salmon, sturgeon, elk, and porcupine, whose populations have undergone serious declines in the past century. In addition, elders were particularly concerned about observed changes in temperature, flow, and water quality of the Klamath River. These and other environmental changes could disrupt traditional ways of Yurok life.

The selected areas are among the most important sites for recreation in Guam and CNMI and, as such, are key to the economy of these islands. The outlook reports will describe pressures in the focus areas as well as current ecosystem state and will forecast the sustainability of the sites under current and alternate management regimes. Project outputs are being collaboratively developed with resource managers to ensure the outlook reports identify and prioritize near and long-term actions to maximize sustainability and goods and services provision. Community members, stakeholders and managers will be interested in the outlook reports as many of the high priority actions identified will require reducing pressure on coral reefs through changes in human activities on the land and in the water.

We evaluated climate responses of sagebrush using two approaches: (1) experimental manipulations of temperature and precipitation for natural plants in the field, and (2) assessment of how climate adaptation and weather have affected sagebrush seeding efforts on nearly 25 large-scale sagebrush seeding projects done over the past several decades. Experimental warming increased growth of sagebrush in high-elevation meadows in the Teton Mountains, but had marginal or no effect at lower elevations sites (near Twin Falls and Boise, Idaho, respectively). Increased precipitation enhanced sagebrush abundance, along with flowering and stem growth, particularly when added in winter on deep soils. In the post-fire seeding study, we found sagebrush abundances to be highly variable across different seeding projects, and the variation was partly related to the climate of seeding and seed-source sites and weather. Sagebrush seeds typically traveled hundreds of kilometers and nearly 1000 m downhill from seed source/origins to seeding sites, from sites with colder minimum temperatures than the seeding sites. Big sagebrush is comprised of subspecies that differ in their climate adaptation, and many seeding projects received a subspecies that differed from the native type requested by the land managers. These climate transfers appeared important to the success of seedings: successful seedings imported seeds from sites having the same minimum temperatures.

In the western U.S., severe drought and rising temperatures have caused increased tree mortality and complete forest diebacks. Forests are changing rapidly, and while land managers are working to develop long-term climate change adaptation plans, they require tools that can enhance forest resistance to drought now. To address this immediate need, researchers are examining whether a common forest management tool, prescribed fire, can be implemented to help forests better survive drought.   Prescribed fire is commonly used in the western U.S. to remove potential wildfire fuel, such as small trees and shrubs. It is also thought that this act of selectively removing some trees helps the remaining trees better survive drought events, because there is less competition for water. However, the proposition that prescribed burning could improve forest resistance to drought has never been formally tested. By comparing the survivorship of trees in burned and unburned forest monitoring plots in drought-impacted areas, researchers will determine (a) whether prescribed fire is an effective tool for improving forest resistance to drought, and (b) whether factors such as time since fire and tree species and size influence a forest\u2019s degree of resistance.   In the face of ongoing climate change and projected future drought conditions in the West, this study will help land managers make informed decisions on how to best allocate limited climate change adaptation funds. The results will help managers make cost-benefit analyses of dollars spent using prescribed fire and determine whether this method can be used to prepare forests for a drier future.

Second, a series of workshops were held to solicit input about climate-related data needs and to discuss best practices for accessing and using downscaled climate projections. Finally, downscaled projections are now being made available as an enterprise-level web-based source. Users are able to freely access the data via an interactive, easily manageable interface, in formats which are familiar to ecosystem and impact modelers. The work enables impact assessments to be based on the same common data set, allowing researchers and resource managers to compare results and projections across regions and ecosystems.   Additionally, a research team also developed the core climatic datasets necessary to project regional ecosystem impacts resulting from 21st century climate change. They adhered to an approach that carefully assessed and propagated model uncertainty, downscaled climate projections to the scale of important ecosystem processes, and focused on the most impact-relevant climatic variables. They worked on addressing three questions: (1) What is the magnitude and direction of climate change expected in the U.S. Southeast over the next 100 years?

This region is a primary nesting site for many migratory birds. The YKD, meanwhile, is a vast wetland/tundra landscape on Alaska\u2019s remote western coast. One of the largest deltas in the world, the YKD supports millions of nesting and migrating waterfowl and shorebirds, and is the largest goose nesting habitat in North America.   As climate conditions change and permafrost decreases in thickness and extent, these important landscapes are at risk of undergoing significant change. To conserve these rich ecosystems, managers require information on both current ecosystem conditions and projected changes in the landscape that might occur as temperatures and precipitation patterns change. This project seeks to meet this need by exploring the vulnerability of the ACP and YKD to changing climate conditions and characterizing the impacts of future landscape changes on shorebird and waterfowl populations. Researchers will develop high-resolution maps of current land cover, as well as maps showing projected change in land cover through 2100.

We identified several other loci under strong directional selection not related to climate and described a previously unknown pattern of strong genetic divergence of bighorn sheep within the White Mountains compared to other populations. Overall, these findings suggest selection from environmental factors may influence genomic variation at the ecosystem-scale in desert bighorn sheep and these results extend our understanding of how this subspecies may respond to different environmental conditions. Natural selection may result in local adaptation to different environmental conditions across the range of a species. Understanding local adaptation, in turn, informs management decisions such as translocation to restore locally-extinct populations. We used a landscape genomics approach to detect genetic signatures of selection related to climatic variation among desert bighorn sheep populations across their indigenous range in the western United States. This approach allowed us to investigate broad patterns of both neutral and adaptive genetic variation across very different environments. Analyses suggested that ancestry and isolation by distance were the most significant forces driving genetic variation in desert bighorn sheep, but that climate was associated with at least 1 locus (i.e., location on the genome) under directional selection. The alternate allele (i.e., variant) at this locus was associated with biologically significant increases in elevation and precipitation, decreases in temperature, and was nearly private to herds occupying the Great Basin ecosystem. Our results suggest climate conditions at higher latitudes may have resulted in a distinct ecotype of desert bighorn sheep whose adaptations are still apparent among the few remaining indigenous populations in the Great Basin.

These include 18 species that are already federally listed as threatened or endangered and four other species petitioned for listing that are scheduled for development of Species Status Assessments (SSAs). Today, south Florida\u2019s pine rockland ecosystem represents less than 3 percent of its original extent. Threats such as saltwater intrusion from hurricanes and sea-level rise pose the greatest risk to the longevity of this ecosystem.  For the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make decisions about the potential listing of a species, they must be able to forecast a species\u2019 responses to potential future environmental conditions, as well as to different conservation and management actions. Yet, for many imperiled species in the pine rocklands, the information needed to complete these forecasts\u2014such as population trends, life history traits, habitat use, and future land use and climate conditions--is often lacking. This is especially problematic for assessments of species resiliency to changes in climate and land use.  When these types of data are lacking, information on habitat quality can be used to help determine how a species will respond to change. This project will evaluate habitat conditions for two species found in the pine rockland ecosystem - the rim rock crowned snake and the key ringneck snake. These species are being considered for federal listing, and very little is known about their ecology and demography. Researchers will identify potential future changes in habitat that could result from different management actions, such as habitat acquisition or restoration, and environmental conditions, such as changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms and rates of sea-level rise. They will then explore the potential impacts of these habitat condition changes on the rim rock crowned snake and key ringneck snake.  This information can be used to develop future habitat condition scenarios in forthcoming SSAs for these species. While this project focuses on these two species of snakes, the results could inform the conservation, management, and recovery of other at-risk species found in the pine rocklands ecosystem.

Hundreds of papers using distribution models - based almost exclusively on relationships between plants and climate - have been published. The predictions of these models undergird conservation plans, are used to forecast the magnitude of future extinctions, and to leverage efforts to produce policies aimed at mitigating the effects of climatic change.

One of the major threats these birds face is avian malaria, which is spread by a species of introduced mosquito and can have death rates exceeding 90 percent. For decades, upper mountain forests have provided refuge for Hawaiian forest birds because mosquitoes (and thus the disease) could not survive the cooler temperatures. However, warming associated with climate change could change this. Scientists used climate data and an epidemiological model to evaluate the future impacts of avian malaria on Hawaiian forest birds as a result of climate change. Results show that over the current century, anticipated changes in temperature and rainfall will favor increased mosquito populations and their expansion into high-elevation forests.

Resource managers can no longer rely solely on historical data and trends to base their actions, and are in need of science that is relevant to their specific needs and can directly inform important planning decisions. Questions remain, however, regarding the most effective and efficient methods for extending scientific knowledge and products into management and decision-making.  This study analyzes two unique cases of water management to better understand how science can be translated into resource management actions and decision-making.  In particular, this project seeks to understand 1) the characteristics that make science actionable and useful for water resource management and drought preparedness, and 2) the ideal types of scientific knowledge or science products that facilitate the use of science in management and decision-making.  The first case study focuses on beaver mimicry, an emerging nature-based solution that increases the presence of wood and woody debris in rivers and streams to mimic the actions of beavers. This technique has been rapidly adopted by natural resource managers as a way to restore riparian areas, increase groundwater infiltration, and slow surface water flow so that more water is available later in the year during hotter and dryer months. The second case study focuses on an established research program, Colorado Dust on Snow, that provides water managers with scientific information explaining how the movement of dust particles from the Colorado Plateau influences hydrology and the timing and intensity of snow melt and water runoff into critical water sources. This program has support from and is being used by several water conservation districts in the state.  Understanding how scientific knowledge translates into action and decision-making in these cases will strengthen our knowledge of actionable science in the context of drought and its impacts on ecosystems.

Maintaining healthy herds not only supports the ecosystems where these species are found, but also the hunting and wildlife watching communities. For example, in Wyoming, big game hunting contributed over $300 million to the state\u2019s economy in 2015. Yet as climate conditions change, the quantity, quality, and timing of vegetation available to mule deer, elk, and other ungulates, known as forage, could shift. It\u2019s possible that these changes could have cascading impacts on the behavior and population sizes of many species.  A key strategy used by managers to improve forage availability and adapt to change is the implementation of habitat treatments. These treatments include prescribed fire, forest thinning, and removal of invasive weeds, and are currently being planned to counteract the expected decline in mule deer habitat in the Kemmerer-Cokeville Area of southwestern Wyoming. To ensure that these activities are effective in meeting their goals, it is important for managers to have information on how forage conditions are already changing due to climate variability, and what any potential tradeoffs associated with these techniques may be.  Focusing on Montana and Wyoming, this project aims to meet this need by achieving three objectives. First, researchers will prepare summaries of past and future changes in forage by watershed, herd, and hunting area for both states. These summaries will help managers prioritize areas for management by providing baseline information about the direction, degree, and certainty of change in the quality and timing of forage. Second, researchers will assess changes in forage conditions in aspen, sagebrush, and mixed mountain shrub habitat in southwest Wyoming. They will develop maps of future forage based on scenarios that reflect probabilities of important weather patterns (such as drought), the current distribution of invasive cheatgrass (which decreases forage quality), and expected effects of planned habitat treatments, such as prescribed fire. Lastly, researchers will use these maps to evaluate the effects of treatment options on mule deer migration, fawning, and summer habitat, and on elk calving, migration, and habitat use.  The results of this project will be useful to a broad range of managers, including those with the states of Wyoming and Montana, and with federal agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Land Management.

In the United States, the ecosystem services provided by wetlands are worth billions of dollars and include flood protection, erosion control, seafood, water quality enhancement, carbon storage, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Unfortunately, these ecosystems are also highly sensitive to changing climate conditions. Past research on climate impacts to coastal wetlands have concentrated primarily on sea-level rise, largely ignoring the important influence of changing temperature and precipitation patterns. Understanding the impact of temperature and precipitation on coastal wetlands can help natural and cultural resource managers account for these factors when making decisions or developing adaptation plans.  This study advances understanding of how temperature and precipitation influence coastal wetland ecosystems. The study models the relationships between wetland plant community structure and climate in the northern Gulf of Mexico and identifies potential impacts of future climate conditions on these ecosystems. The researchers identify critical ecological thresholds and demonstrate that transformative ecological changes due to climatic shifts are probable throughout the Gulf of Mexico within this century. In certain areas, small changes in temperature or rainfall are expected to trigger large ecological changes and affect certain ecosystem services. Because coastal wetland ecosystems in other parts of the world are also sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, the findings of this research have global implications, helping to inform the management of these highly valuable ecosystems under a changing climate.

The website also provides facts on traditional growing practices and timings, crop tolerances, and nutrition. Pages can be downloaded, printed, and distributed by local agricultural extension services.  This project is being implemented by Marshallese partners at the Ministry of Resources and Development, College of the Marshall Islands, and Land Grant program, and external partners from the University of Hawai\u02bbi, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Scientists also need information from these stakeholders to understand what science questions need to be answered, develop research priorities, and gain important insight about the landscape based on personal experiences and generational knowledge. However, effective two-way conversations between scientists and stakeholders are often limited, due to resource constraints, a lack of necessary communication skills and tools, and other factors.   A mechanism for better communication between scientists and stakeholders is needed to facilitate the successful exchange of scientific information. This project aims to address this need by developing the ScienceTapes project, an initiative to record and archive conversations between research scientists and non-scientists in order to share science stories to build connections between people, science, and the environment to create a greater understanding of change in Alaska\u2019s llandscapes.   The project team is partnering with StoryCorps and has trained a group of volunteers to facilitate effective conversations between two people. The volunteers then participated in facilitating, recording and archiving the conversations. Since the initial training period ScienceTapes has set up listening stations at events and conferences across Alaska. The team has facilitated over 60 conversations, with 49 currently archived with StoryCorps and the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. ScienceTapes has recorded conversations with a wide-array of people, including research scientists, students ( from elementary to graduate level), decision makers, resource managers, engineers, rural community members, politicians, Alaskan elders (rural and urban), film makers, and media personnel.    Several of the recordings from the first year have been processed into shorter pieces that can be accessed on the project\u2019s pilot website (www.sciencetapes.org). The project coordinators also intend to create a model for science communication that can be applied to a variety of other science communication needs in the larger science community. As the ScienceTapes team moves past its collaboration and partnership with StoryCorps, the focus of the project will be expanded.

Alternatively, indirect climate effects from warmer temperatures may be playing a role, such as increased prevalence of parasites (e.g., brainworm, winter tick) to levels lethal to moose. Additionally, factors such as predation, differences in habitat, and fitness are being considered. Genomics has the potential to complement ongoing research by providing unique approaches to explore moose responses to stress through the examination of molecular differences in heat tolerance, immune response, or fitness in general. This project is utilizing such genomic techniques to study the responses of moose to environmental stressors throughout the southern periphery of their range in the U.S. Northeast, Midwest (Minnesota and Michigan), and Rocky Mountains. Because populations from those regions represent three subspecies, it is important to first understand population relatedness and any genetic variances through a genome scan. Secondarily, we will investigate actively expressed genes and cellular function, which may provide information on variation in immune responses to local stressors. Ultimately, we will look for genes that may be under selection, which could represent local adaptations to environmental conditions. This information has the potential to provide insights on moose fitness in a changing environment and aims to provide valuable information for managers in regions that are interested in maintaining sustainable populations.

First, they can undergo adaptive evolutionary change. Second, they can adjust their phenotype via non-evolutionary pathways. Both of these factors could substantially change species climate change vulnerability rankings. In this proposal, we will draw from a wide range of existing data to incorporate the ability of species to adjust their phenotype to climate change into vulnerability assessments.

In the face of increasing temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and large uncertainty, natural resource managers need to assess vulnerability of species in order to develop adaptation options and conservation strategies. This research is evaluating how shifting climate is directly and indirectly affecting mammal populations in the northeasten U.S.  We use a variety of methods to do this, including long-term data, field surveys, elevational transects, camera trapping, live trapping, radio telemetery, genetic analysis, and isotope analysis, as well as literature syntheses and project screening tools. The goal is to understand how current community dynamics may be altered given predicted changes in climate and habitat to inform conservation and management in the region.    Phase II:  Adaptation through resilience and resistance  This project supports collaborations between the NE CASC and the Northern Research Station of the U.S. Forest Service to increase the resilience and resistance of climate-vulnerable species and ecosystems. The project will reveal how mammal distributions are shifting in northern forest landscapes and investigate how climate change adaptation strategies, including conserving climate change refugia, could benefit forests, wildlife, and northeastern economies.  After documenting changes in mammal distribution in northern forest landscapes associated with climate variation to help fill a critical data gap and help to inform regional models (Phase I), we will:     \tInvestigate and compare climate change adaptation strategies in order to improve management of climate-vulnerable forests and their dependent wildlife in the face of climate change. \tMake recommendations for conserving climate change refugia, areas buffered from climate change that enable persistence of species of conservation concern or economic benefit.

Stretching from the High Plains of New Mexico eastward to the Mississippi River, the Red River Basin encompasses parts of five states \u2013 New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. Further, 74% of the jurisdictional boundaries of the Chickasaw and Choctaw Tribes are located within the basin.   Water resources in the basin have been stressed in recent years due to a multi-year drought and increasing demands for consumptive use by metropolitan areas in Oklahoma and Texas. Unfortunately, currently available projections of future precipitation across the region show a high degree of uncertainty, making it difficult for water managers to plan for the future.   The goal of this project is to provide resource managers with critical information on the impacts of climate change on flow in the Red River Basin. Researchers (1) used global climate models to make climate projections for the basin, and (2) developed models to determine the impacts of projected future climate conditions on stream flow. The modeling results can be used to evaluate future water supplies for water providers and flows for the environment.   The Red River Basin lies within the boundaries of three Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs), and the results of this project will help the LCCs and other managers reduce the impacts of floods and droughts and make decisions regarding the potential need for additional reservoirs or diversions of water into the Red River Basin. The tools developed for this study can also be used to evaluate the impacts of different flow conditions on aquatic life or water quality in the basin.

Many species are moving in directions and at rates that correspond with recent climatic change. Understanding how species distributions and abundances are likely to be altered can inform management and planning activities resulting in more robust management. We projected climate-driven changes in the abundances and distributions of 31 focal bird species in Oregon and Washington using the latest downscaled CMIP5 climate projections and corresponding vegetation model outputs. We mapped these future projections and integrated them into an existing web-based tool (http://data.pointblue.org/apps/nwcsc/) to allow managers and planners to access and download the projections. Our model outputs forecast significant changes in vegetation across much of Washington and Oregon by the end of the century. These changes are particularly dramatic east of the Cascade Mountains. Our bird models project much less dramatic changes in avian communities across the two states, but those changes tend to be largest in the Olympic and Cascade Mountains as well as across portions of the Columbia Plateau and in eastern and southeastern Oregon. Despite the smaller changes in avian communities, our models do project significant changes in abundance for some species in specific locations ranging from large increases to local extirpations. Our results also show that for some bird species, vegetation model projections are particularly important for forecasting changes in abundances and distributions. For example, Columbia Plateau Low Sagebrush Steppe and Shrubland, Northern Rocky Mountain-Vancouverian Montane-Foothill Grassland, and Great Basin and Intermountain (Sagebrush) Shrubland and Steppe were particularly important predictors for Oregon Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus affinis). Dynamic general vegetation model (DGVM) outputs, such as fire, fuels, and carbon were important predictors of these habitat types.

Warming temperatures, clearly documented in climate records for the Colorado River basin, are having an impact on the amount of annual streamflow yielded from rain and snow. Recent work has revealed that warming temperatures have played an increasingly important role over the past decades, both exacerbating droughts and dampening the effects of wet winters on high stream flows. Understanding and anticipating how warming temperatures will influence future water supply in the Colorado River basin is increasingly important for resource management, particularly in light of recent drought conditions.   The overarching goals of this project are to better understand the influence of temperature on Colorado River streamflow, particularly during droughts, and assist water managers in planning for future droughts. This work expands on a recently completed study, building on that project in two main ways. First, this project extends collaborative work between scientists and Colorado River basin water managers to investigate the range of potential drought conditions under early 21st century warming, using both recent and historical data. For example, with precipitation reconstructions from tree rings for the past 500 years, the team can use a simple hydrologic model to assess the impacts of the longest and most severe droughts of the past on the Colorado River under today\u2019s warmer temperatures. With this information, the project team will contribute to a set of plausible scenarios of future drought that planners can use to help make resource-management decisions. Second, the project is more explicitly examining the drivers of Colorado River drought, with a focus on factors such as the phase of precipitation (rain vs. snow), the timing and rate of snowmelt, and evaporation rates.

Monitoring flow in the stream using a streamgage provides information about the amount and timing of surface water resources. However, not every stream has a streamgage and decisions about water resources may need to be made in a watershed where there is no flow information. Hydrologic models can be used to provide estimates of streamflow in the absence of streamflow information. These models depend upon available streamflow data for calibration, and can be very inaccurate without the use of those data. This research developed a method to group watersheds that are gaged with watersheds that are not gaged so that accurate estimates of water availability can be provided regionally. To accomplish this, various models, techniques, and data were used to group watersheds across the southeastern United States. This means that watersheds were not necessarily grouped by proximity to one another, but instead were grouped based on their response to climate and their landscape setting. This results in consistently developed regional estimates of water availability for current and potential future climate and land cover in the southeastern United States.

Over the past century, however, populations have dramatically declined due to habitat loss, overharvest, and invasive species. Consequently, many populations are listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Complicating these stressors is global warming and associated climate change. Overall, aquatic ecosystems across the PNW are predicted to experience increasingly earlier snowmelt in the spring, reduced late spring and summer flows, increased winter flooding, warmer and drier summers, increased water temperatures, and expansion of invasive species. Understanding how effects of climate change might influence habitat for native salmonid populations is critical for effective management and recovery of these species. Scientists at the USGS and University of Montana used novel techniques and empirical data to study how climate change may drive landscape scale impacts that affect freshwater habitats and populations of key salmonid species (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and steelhead) throughout the PNW. Results showed strong linkages between climatic drivers (temperature and flow regimes) and the distribution, abundance, and genetic diversity of native salmonids across the PNW. Specifically, warming temperatures and shifting flow regimes are expected to fragment stream systems and cause salmonids to retreat upstream to headwater areas, thereby decreasing fish population abundance and genetic diversity, both of which are critical for persistence in a changing landscape.

Input used to delineate the valley bottoms include a 30 m DEM and the NHD moderate resolution data.The algorithm estimates unconfined valley bottoms (UVB) from elevation and stream data in a GIS. We used the NHD streams and 30 m National Elevation Dataset (NED) data packaged with the NHD dataset. The UVB algorithm calculates a first-pass estimate of UVB using a GIS cost-distance approach (distance from stream times ground slope), and results are refined using a valley-filling procedure where a valley is \u201cflooded\u201d to a set flood height above the stream channel elevation. The flood height is set as a user-defined \u201cflood factor\u201d multiplied by bankfull depth. We used a flood factor of 6 in this analysis. The flood height is spread outward from the stream until it intersects a valley wall, and is further confined by a user-defined maximum ground slope (9%) and max valley width, which we set to 2000 m.  We used an annual mean precipitation value of 150 cm for the study area, and all other variables in the algorithm were set to defaults. Further details on the algorithm can be found in Nagel et al.

This region provides critical breeding and migratory habitat for waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species, and is also a highly productive agricultural region. Generally, the regional effects projected by climate models are increasing temperatures and more variable precipitation, which could provide incentives for private landowners to convert native and managed grassland to intensive cropland. Conversion of grassland to cropland can result in habitat loss for dependent species and the degradation of a range of ecosystem services. If climate change alters the spatial distribution of both agricultural land use and suitable habitat, land managers and conservationists may need to alter efforts to offset the negative consequences of combined climate and land-use change on habitats and dependent species. The land-use change projections associated with this report provide information for such management efforts. The purpose of this project was to estimate and map the probability that grassland converts to cropland in the northern plains and prairie region given potential climate change. This region, which spans portions of Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, provides critical breeding and migratory habitat for waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species, and is also a highly productive agricultural region. Planning for the effects of climate change in this region is a high priority for the Plains and Prairie Pothole LCC and managers at federal, regional, and local levels (e.g. North American Waterfowl Management Plan 2012). Climate models for the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) project increasing temperatures and little to no increases in precipitation (though potentially more variability), leading to reductions in wetland habitat through increased evapotranspiration (Johnson et al. 2010). Populations of waterfowl and other species often decrease during droughts (Sorenson et al. 1998), raising concerns that hunting opportunities could be compromised and that the long-term viability of non-game populations may be at risk. Changes in climate can also have indirect effects on biodiversity by driving changes in human land use. Warmer temperatures, resulting in longer crop growing seasons and changes in crop yields, could incentivize landowners to alter their land-management practices or to transition from less intensive grassland uses to intensive row crop production (Rashford et al. 2010), which alters habitats and wetland functions (Rashford et al. 2016). Understanding the full effect of climate change on habitat therefore requires accounting for both the direct (e.g., increased evapotranspiration) and indirect effects (e.g., land-use change) (Attavanich et al. 2014).", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5beca754e4b0b3fc5cf9181a", "item_phrases": ["habitat loss", "other species", "north american waterfowl management plan 2012", "such management efforts", "climate", "wyoming", "suitable habitat", "potential climate", "climate models", "intensive cropland", "less intensive grassland", "alters habitats", "intensive grassland uses", "land-use change", "sorenson et al.", "spans portions", "south dakota", "planning", "sorenson", "conversion", "north dakota", "prairie pothole region", "land-management practices", "pothole lcc", "dakota", "climate change", "negative consequences", "rashford et al.", "land-use change projections", "wetland habitat", "non-game populations", "migratory habitat", "prairie pothole lcc", "crop yields", "wetland-dependent species", "ecosystem services", "regional effects", "agricultural land use", "local levels", "intensive row crop production", "grassland converts", "understanding", "spatial distribution", "dependent species", "private landowners", "human land use", "minnesota", "northern plains", "variable precipitation", "other wetland-dependent species", "waterfowl management", "plains", "potential climate change", "attavanich et al.", "land managers", "high priority", "johnson et al.", "pothole region", "populations", "prairie region", "warmer", "attavanich", "ppr", "indirect effects", "more variable precipitation", "productive agricultural region", "wetland functions", "montana", "incentivize landowners", "rashford", "full effect", "iowa", "johnson", "long-term viability"], "weighted_sim": 0.6832, "avg_sim": 0.7013}}}, "559afca9e4b0b94a64016ff9": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/559afca9e4b0b94a64016ff9", "proj_summary": "On Hawai\u2018i\u2019s mountains, cloud droplets, propelled by strong winds, are deposited on plants, where they accumulate and drip to the ground, adding water over and above that supplied by rainfall.

In order to identify the impacts of climate change on Florida\u2019s plants and wildlife, researchers developed regional climate scenarios identifying how temperature and precipitation patterns may change in the future.

The results of the climate modeling effort identified changes in precipitation, temperature, seasonal cycles, and the frequency of events such as extreme heat days, frost days, and wildfire threats.   These scenarios were then used in species, habitat, and ecosystem models to characterize the potential ecological impacts of climate change.

Throughout the course of 2017, the gauge registered an unprecedented number of high-water events.

The threat of rising sea levels to the essential infrastructure and cultural assets of island communities is well known. However, inadequate information limits the ability of resource managers to predict and prepare for the impacts of sea-level rise and associated inundation. Researchers will address this issue by collaborating with the National Park Service to identify the specific needs of managers at two national parks in Hawai\u2019i: the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument (VALR), which is home to the USS Arizona Memorial, and Pu\u2018uhonua O H\u014dnaunau National Historical Park (PUHO). These parks were impacted by the high water levels observed in 2017. Boat docks at VALR were compromised, and culturally sensitive archeological features were inundated at PUHO. As a result, park managers are trying to understand the implications of these events for the future of park assets and operations.   Building upon previous research efforts to better understand the frequency and implications of future coastal flooding and inundation events in the Pacific Islands, researchers will develop tools that provide the current status and advanced notice of the various oceanic conditions that contribute to high water levels. Researchers will work with park managers to determine relevant water level thresholds and planning horizons for VALR and PUHO, and identify at-risk assets and assess their vulnerability.

Studying them and copying their characteristics can also help humans build our homes and communities to be more resistant to wildfire.

Results showed that two-thirds of the species examined could be expected to experience a decrease in range, while one-third could experience an increase. Climate variables were found to play a bigger role than landscape or plant variables in determining changes in species range. Researchers also found that as available habitat patches for birds and reptiles become more isolated, their ranges also contract.

However, climate change is causing lower and warmer summer stream flows that could decimate these fish populations. Aquatic cold-water habitats are further threatened by stormwater runoff, which moves from streets to storm drains and then is often discharged into cold-water rivers and streams. The urban heat island effect (when cities and urban areas are warmer than surrounding rural areas) may heat the temperature of the runoff and if the runoff is very warm, it could tip salmon habitat into fatal conditions.  However, specifically how urban warming \u2013 or cooling, such as by tree shade \u2013 affects the temperature of stormwater runoff from streets to storm drains is not well documented or understood.  Urban street trees are already well known, and even managed, to help trap rainfall and reduce runoff quantity. This study will test whether or not street trees could also be managed in ways that help reduce runoff temperature. Data gathered from streets in Portland, OR, will document how runoff temperature is affected by the amount and type (deciduous vs. conifer) of street trees in different locations and seasons over two years. The data will then be used to improve computer models that currently show the benefits of street trees but which do not yet consider runoff temperature. These models are widely used by cities to help with tree planting and management decisions. The results of this project will provide missing information to cities throughout the Pacific Northwest, on how to use existing street tree \u201cinfrastructure\u201d to, at little additional cost, also help reduce the negative impacts that warm urban runoff can have on aquatic ecosystems already stressed by drought and climate change.

Black bear, bighorn sheep, mule deer, and wild turkey are just a few of the species found in these isolated mountain ecosystems that rise out of the desert landscape. However, recent droughts have crippled these ecosystems, causing significant tree death. Climate predictions suggest that this region will only face hotter and drier conditions in the future, potentially stressing these ecosystems even further. Simple models predict that vegetation will move to cooler and wetter locations in response to this warming. However, species responses will likely be more complex than these models show, as vegetation navigates other ecological stressors such as elevation change and water availability.  In order to better predict how vegetation will move in response to future warming, a more robust understanding of how drought and temperature impact tree survival is needed. Focusing on three sky island habitats in western Texas, this project will identify the key traits influencing current distributions of forest tree species, determine the susceptibility of these species to drought and temperature, and develop fine-scale, localized climate projections that model future conditions for the study area. This information will then be used to predict how species might shift location in response to warmer and drier future climates, enabling managers to make more robust decisions that will preserve sky island forests in the face of a changing climate.

These changes have the potential to influence the ability of barrier islands to serve as a first-line of defense for the mainland during storm events. Gulf Islands National Seashore, a National Park Service unit in the northern Gulf of Mexico between Florida and Mississippi, is predominantly comprised of barrier islands and faces immediate challenges, including erosion that washes out roads and sand dunes and the adverse impacts on cultural and natural resources from exposure to saltwater. Managers require realistic estimates of both the vulnerability of the park\u2019s natural and cultural resources to these threats, as well as the likelihood of the potential harmful consequences of exposure to these threats.  The goal of this project is to support efficient adaptation planning of vulnerable coastal resources in the Gulf Islands National Seashore region, and to identify research priorities that will help predict future changes to barrier islands. First, researchers will implement an existing adaptation planning framework designed to assist the National Park Service in making effective cultural resource adaptation decisions under a range of budget constraints. This framework includes the use of Optimal Preservation (OptiPres), a model that considers the combined effects of the exposure of resources to threats such as storm surge, and the costs and benefits of various management actions taken to address these threats. Researchers will improve the model by developing better estimates of the frequency of storm events that would result in saltwater inundation of forts and historic buildings at the park. Researchers will also bring together managers and technical experts to evaluate the science-based information needs related to sediment dynamics in the Gulf Islands National Seashore region, and to explore paths forward for addressing these needs.

Many federal, state and local agencies use stream insects to monitor the health of freshwater ecosystems. While the temperature ranges for some insects are often inferred from the temperature of the waters where they were collected, this inference is coarse at best and problematic at worst. Stream temperatures fluctuate a lot during the year and temperature may or may not control where an insect lives. Field insects were collected and sent to a laboratory for testing several temperature endpoints, particularly at higher temperatures. Respiration, breathing rate, and some physical activities were expected to increase, as the insects attempt to deal with elevated temperatures and expected oxygen limitations. Previous research found that oxygen limitation results in the build-up of lactic and uric acids in tissues of insects, but this was not observed over the range of temperatures and types of insects tested for this study. While respiration, breathing rate and, physical behavior such as pumping motions were observed, it did not appear that elevated temperature alone was resulting in oxygen limitation. This was further confirmed with more experiments that looked specifically at low oxygen waters at various temperatures and included an evaluation of the insect\u2019s metabolic waste products; these warm temperature challenges did not suggest an oxygen deficit in these insects. Rather, the experiments suggested a more general elevated metabolic demand where the insects had to work harder to breath, eat, and molt.

In order to prepare for these changes, land and resource managers need to be able to predict how species will respond, what specific mechanisms are driving these changes, and what thresholds wildlife species may soon be pushed across. Crossing these thresholds could lead to rapid change or decline in the health of a wildlife population.  In response to this need, a team of researchers is working to identify the primary drivers (climate change vs. urban growth) of changes in the distribution of wildlife in the Northeast and examine potential changes in their distribution over time in order to identify possible biological thresholds that would significantly alter the biology and health of wildlife populations. The team will also determine how changing temperature and precipitation will influence wildlife interactions and tree and bird species, as well as examine how specific events, like extreme storms, may be correlated to biological thresholds.

This is because a primary way in which species respond to climate change is by adjusting their geographic ranges to find more suitable temperatures and adequate food supplies. It is also because connectivity facilitates many other important ecological and evolutionary processes within species' ranges, further promoting resilience and healthy populations. However, widespread fragmentation of landscapes by human activities presents a serious obstacle to these processes, which may contribute to a decline in biodiversity, and subsequent declines in the many services healthy ecosystems provide, such as clean air and water.  In order to address the need for effective connectivity management in the face of climate change, scientists teamed with land managers in the transboundary region of British Columbia and Washington State to apply the best available science directly to the information needs of those seeking to manage connectivity. The scientists and managers used conceptual models to understand and project a wide range of future impacts to connectivity for 13 case studies. They also identified a diverse set of adaptation responses to address connectivity. For example, managers might implement prescribed burns, control invasive species, or restore riparian areas to maintain existing core habitat areas and their connections.

The effects of climate change may be particularly large in mountainous regions where climate can vary significantly with elevation. Understanding potential future vegetation changes in these regions requires methods that can resolve vegetation responses to climate change at fine spatial resolutions. This research was projected using three models: cgcm31, hadley, and current. We used LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, to assess potential future vegetation changes for a large topographically complex area of the northwest United States and southwest Canada (38.0\u201358.0\u00b0N latitude by 136.6\u2013103.0\u00b0W longitude). LPJ is a process-based vegetation model that mechanistically simulates the effect of changing climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetation. It was developed and has been mostly applied at spatial resolutions of 10-minutes or coarser. In this study, we used LPJ at a 30-second (~1-km) spatial resolution to simulate potential vegetation changes for 2070\u20132099. LPJ was run using downscaled future climate simulations from five coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (CCSM3, CGCM3.1(T47), GISS-ER, MIROC3.2(medres), UKMO-HadCM3) produced using the A2 greenhouse gases emissions scenario. Under projected future climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the simulated vegetation changes result in the contraction of alpine, shrub-steppe, and xeric shrub vegetation across the study area and the expansion of woodland and forest vegetation. Large areas of maritime cool forest and cold forest are simulated to persist under projected future conditions. The fine spatial-scale vegetation simulations resolve patterns of vegetation change that are not visible at coarser resolutions and these fine-scale patterns are particularly important for understanding potential future vegetation changes in topographically complex areas. The aim of this study was to simulate vegetation responses to climate change at a fine spatial resolution across our topographically complex study area that includes vegetation ranging from xeric vegetation in the interior western United States to mesic vegetation along the Pacific Coast. LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, was able to accurately simulate historical vegetation for many parts of the study area when compared with both potential natural vegetation data for the United States and remotely sensed land cover data, providing confidence in the model's ability to simulate vegetation at fine spatial resolutions in topographically complex regions. The simulated future vegetation changes displayed fine spatial-scale patterns of contraction, expansion, and persistence of vegetation, all mediated by the region\u2019s topography. The results of this study improve our understanding of the potential magnitude and complexity of future vegetation changes that may occur in mountainous regions, with the caveat that many uncertainties associated with both projections of future climates and potential vegetation responses to climate change have yet to be resolved.", "item_url":

sampling 46 North American biomes were used to predict the geographic distribution of biomes from climate variables using the Random Forests classification tree. Techniques were incorporated to accommodate a large number of classes and to predict the future occurrence of climates beyond the contemporary climatic range of the biomes. Errors of prediction from the statistical model averaged 3.7%, but for individual biomes, ranged from 0% to 21.5%. In validating the ability of the model to identify climates without analogs, 78% of 1528 locations outside North America and 81% of land area of the Caribbean Islands were predicted to have no analogs among the 46 biomes. Biome climates were projected into the future according to low and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios of three General Circulation Models  (cgcm, hadley, and consensus) for three periods, the decades surrounding 2030, 2060, and 2090. Prominent in the projections were (1) expansion of climates suitable for the tropical dry deciduous forests of Mexico, (2) expansion of climates typifying desertscrub biomes of western USA and northern Mexico, (3) stability of climates typifying the evergreen\u2013deciduous forests of eastern USA, and (4) northward expansion of climates suited to temperate forests, Great Plains grasslands, and montane forests to the detriment of taiga and tundra climates. Maps indicating either poor agreement among projections or climates without contemporary analogs identify geographic areas where land management programs would be most equivocal. Concentrating efforts and resources where projections are more certain can assure land managers a greater likelihood of success.  Because General Circulation Models (GCM) are key to understanding future climates, the tool we envision must take into account the variability in GCM output resulting from different model formulations and emissions scenarios. However, to land managers, variation represents uncertainty, and uncertainty often leads to inaction. Our approach was to emphasize similarities in responses projected from the disparate formulations rather than dwell on the differences. The tool must also contain provisions for identifying future climates with no contemporary analog because new climates may best be suited for species assemblages that do not exist today. To be useful, the scope of a vegetation model should be neither too broad to constrain local interpretation nor so parochial as to limit management options. It is mandatory, moreover, that this tool incorporates powerful statistical techniques that retain the robustness and flexibility necessary for anticipating and accommodating actual changes.  Our analysis uses the biotic communities of Brown (1994), mapped and digitized by Brown et al. (1998). This classification system meshes well with our goals: It is based on distributions of flora and fauna without reliance on physiography, the coverage includes all of North America, and altitudinal zonation of vegetation is an integral part of the system. For simplicity, we use the term \"biome\" to reference the biotic communities. Previous analyses used this classification system for modeling climatic control of biome distributions in western USA. These analyses produced errors of fit (~10%) that largely resulted from an imperfect alignment between digitized polygons in the classification system and the digital elevation model used to generate point estimates of biome climates. Misalignment had greatest impact at borders of polygons, along shore lines, and on mountain peaks, and therefore, was of greatest source of error with small, irregularly shaped polygons and for biomes occurring in altitudinal sequence. In this analysis, we considered biomes from throughout North America and used supplemental information to alleviate adverse effects of the misaligned data files.  We built on the statistical modeling of Rehfeldt et al. (2006) to predict contemporary realized climatic niches of North American biomes. Ecological niche models have received considerable criticism mostly because of their inability to represent migration or colonization potentials, competitive interactions, and effects of enhanced CO2 on water-use efficiency. The first of these is not an issue. Niche modelers themselves make no claims of projecting species distributions, but instead emphasize that their models project suitable climates. Likewise, competitive interactions that limit species distributions can be defined climatically and are invalidated only when future climates have no contemporary analog. By predicting and projecting the occurrence of novel climates, statistical models can negate this second point of contention. However, it is true that correlative models are not yet capable of accounting for physiological impacts of enhanced CO2 on gas exchange and productivity. Such effects, however, are well characterized in only a few species, and impacts on species distributions are unknown. More research is required before effects of enhanced CO2 can be incorporated with credibility into vegetation models, whether correlative or mechanistic. Land managers require decision-support tools suitable for dealing with oncoming climate-mediated ecosystem changes. Progress has been made in converting climatically static vegetation simulators to climatically dynamic models, and guidelines are in use for managing future generations of the broadly dispersed Larix occidentalis of western North America and the narrow endemics, Picea chihuahuensis, P. mexicana, and P. martinezii of Mexico. Yet, for much of North America, comprehensive management guidelines do not exist. Our goal was to develop a statistically valid, climate-driven vegetation model suitable for land-use planning during a changing climate.", "item_url":

Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus), Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), Wolverine (Gulo gulo), based on correlative bioclimatic models and projected changes in vegetation biomes. Bioclimatic models were built using the Random Forest algorithm. Projected changes in vegetation were also modeled using the Random Forest algorithm but were produced by Rehfeldt et al. (2012). Projected current distribution is based on the average climate conditions for the years 1961-1990. Projected future distributions are based on average climate conditions for the years 2070-2099 using downscaled (30-second or ~1-kilometer resolution) climate projections from two Global Circulation Models: CGCM3.1 (T47) and UKMO-HadCM3. Both projections use the A2 emissions scenario and are from the CMIP3 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report) family of climate simulations. Due to changing climatic conditions, species ranges are expected to shift throughout the course of this century. Modeling subsequent shifts in suitable habitat for animal species, and the resulting changes in species assemblages, represent critical information for resource planners and managers. Developing robust suitability models for large geographic areas can be challenging, in part due to insufficient sampling data and to computational limits associated with modeling large geographies at a fine-grained spatial resolution. To overcome these challenges, I developed a method to model habitat suitability in which I built correlative climate suitability models for 366 terrestrial animal species at a relatively coarse spatial resolution for the entire North American continent using species range maps and 23 bioclimatic variables. I then applied the models to both current and projected future climate data downscaled to a moderately fine resolution for western North America. I refined the resulting climate suitability projections by applying a filter that limited suitability to areas in which suitable biomes were projected to be present. I verified my modeling results using an independent species occurrence data set, finding a median accuracy rate of 70%. I found that incorporating information about biomes into the models resulted in projections of larger climate-driven changes in suitability\u2014on average a difference of about 10%. My results also indicate that study species are more likely to see climate-driven losses than gains in habitat suitability. The percentage of study species projected to undergo a significant net decrease in habitat suitability was double the percentage projected to experience a net increase. These results highlight the shortcomings of many broad-scale models and highlight the need to take finer scale vegetation patterns into account. They also indicate that while many animal species could potentially benefit from climate-change induced increases in habitat suitability, the majority of species may suffer from substantial decreases, complicating future conservation efforts. Here, I combine species distribution models based on climate variables with simple biome-level habitat associations to produce models that can project future impacts on species distributions based on projected changes in climate and vegetation, with a reasonable level of accuracy. I then examine how refining the climate suitability models with these biomes associations affects the current suitability for each study species, and also compare differences in mean expansion and contraction of future species habitat suitability as simulated by two global circulation model projections and one emission scenario.", "item_url":

In this species, the supercooling point (SCP) is representative of mortality induced by acute cold exposure. Mountain pine beetle SCP and associated cold-induced mortality fluctuate throughout a generation, with the highest SCPs prior to and following winter. Using observed SCPs of field-collected D. ponderosae larvae throughout the developmental season and associated phloem temperatures, we developed a mechanistic model that describes the SCP distribution of a population as a function of daily changes in the temperature-dependent processes leading to gain and loss of cold tolerance. It is based on the changing proportion of individuals in three states: (1) a non cold-hardened, feeding state, (2) an intermediate state in which insects have ceased feeding, voided their gut content and eliminated as many ice-nucleating agents as possible from the body, and (3) a fully cold-hardened state where insects have accumulated a maximum concentration of cryoprotectants (e.g. glycerol). Shifts in the proportion of individuals in each state occur in response to the driving variables influencing the opposite rates of gain and loss of cold hardening. The level of cold-induced mortality predicted by the model and its relation to extreme winter temperature is in good agreement with a range of field and laboratory observations. Our model predicts that cold tolerance of D. ponderosae varies within a season, among seasons, and among geographic locations depending on local climate. This variability is an emergent property of the model, and has important implications for understanding the insect's response to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, as well as population response to climate change. Because cold-induced mortality is but one of several major influences of climate on D. ponderosae population dynamics, we suggest that this model be integrated with others simulating the insect's biology.

Many recent changes in tree mortality, tree species distributions, and tree growth rates have been linked to changes in climate. Given that future climatic changes will likely surpass those experienced in the recent past, trees will likely face additional challenges as temperatures continue to rise and precipitation regimes shift. Managing forests in the face of climate change will require a basic understanding of which tree species will be most vulnerable to climate change and in what ways they will be vulnerable. We assessed the relative vulnerability to climate change of 11 tree species in western North America using a multivariate approach to quantify elements of sensitivity to climate change, exposure to climate change, and the capacity to adapt to climate change. Our assessment was based on a combination of expert knowledge, published studies, and projected changes in climate. The 11 species exhibited a range of vulnerabilities. Garry oak (Quercus garryana) was determined to be the most vulnerable, largely due to its relatively high sensitivity. Garry oak occupies some of the driest low woodland and savanna sites from British Columbia to California and is highly dependent on disturbances, such as periodic, low intensity fire. These low intensity and high frequency fires suppress competition and intrusion of Garry oak woodlands by conifers. Garry oak is also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and generally only dominates dry sites. Big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) was determined to be the least vulnerable of the 11 species, largely due to its adaptive capacity. Big leaf maple can reproduce quickly after disturbances and its seeds can disperse long distances potentially allowing it to move in response to a changing climate. Our analyses provide a framework for assessing vulnerability and for determining why some species will likely be more vulnerable than others. Such information will be critical as natural resource managers and conservation practitioners strive to address the impacts of climate change with limited funds. In support of the Pacific Northwest Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (www.climatevulnerability.org) we developed a series of tree species projections for use in regional planning. Tree distributions models were built using 42 climate and bioclimatic variables from Climate Western North America climate dataset (www.climatevulnerability.org).

For example, juveniles that become stranded in small pools are at increased risk to overheat, starve, or be consumed by predators.  Healthy salmon populations can cope with fragmentation and recover from a bad drought-year. However, many salmon populations are endangered and face long-term drought. Land and resource managers are increasingly finding endangered salmon stranded in fragmented habitats, facing what is presumed to be certain death. Desperate to help, a small group of managers and conservation stewards are experimenting with fish rescue, capturing juvenile salmon from fragmented habitats and moving them to hatchery-like facilities until they grow large enough to go to sea.  There are growing demands to expand fish rescue programs, however no one has actually evaluated whether it is safe, effective, or feasible at scales that would have meaningful impact. This project aims to measure the effects of fish rescue at multiple life-stages and analyze the costs and benefits of applying this technique across the Northwest.

In short, a subset of pests is likely to get far worse with warming and this effect is likely to be most pronounced in the southeast.

Although scientists have made tremendous progress in predicting the impact of climate change on a regional and global scale, drilling down such projections to a locally applicable form has been difficult. A major project of the US Geological Survey's (USGS) Southwest Biological Science Center (SBSC), funded by the USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC), drew on the work of an interdisciplinary team of scientists to help close the gap between theory and practical application in the arid southwestern U.S. Climate change in this region is predicted to be extreme, with temperature increases within the next 60 to 90 years of 3.5 to 4 degrees Celsius and decreases in precipitation of 5 to 20 percent. These changes have the potential to profoundly affect plant and animal distributions and population viability. Furthermore, more than 70 percent of the lands in the southwestern U.S. are in public ownership. Managers of public lands and wildlife resources will have a particular need to understand climate-driven shifts in order to adapt management strategies to conserve and sustain habitats and wildlife. This project integrated results from three modules to produce data and tools that conservation managers can use in decision-making. These three modules enable scientists to assess the future prospects of the habitats and species most vulnerable to climate change in the Southwest.

We predicted the distribution and abundance of common tree species across portions of the eastern U.S. under alternative climate scenarios that varied in the amount of warming by the end of the century from 1.1 to 4.2 degrees celsius. We used a forest landscape change model to forecast changes in tree abundances and distribution in the North Atlantic region of the U.S. while accounting for climate change, succession, and harvest. We then considered a broader region of the U.S. and combined our results with results from previous studies to compare forecasts from three different modeling approaches for the Central Hardwood, Central Appalachian, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regions to determine the level of agreement among models.  Our forecasts for the North Atlantic region indicated tree abundances were affected first by succession and harvest but second by climate. We predicted an increase in Southern and Central Hardwood species and a decrease in Northern Hardwood and spruce-fir forest species under warming climates over the next 300 years. Our comparison of the three modeling approaches across the eastern U.S. indicated high agreement for many species, especially northern species modeled to lose habitat in coming decades. There was agreement among models for decreases in black spruce, balsam fir, northern white cedar, and red spruce, and increases in loblolly pine and some oaks and hickories. Agreement across different modeling approaches and different climate scenarios provides strong evidence of potentially important changes to forests in response to climate change.

We used the forest landscape change LANDIS PRO and hybrid empirical-physiological ecosystem model LINKAGES to model changes in forest biomass and species abundances and distribution in the North Atlantic region of the U.S. while accounting for climate change, succession, and harvest.

The risks of significant negative impacts are likely to be higher in these island systems than in many temperate regions of the world because of the limited size of their land masses, high numbers of species that only exist in narrowly defined regions, and expectations that tropical environments will experience greater changes in temperature. Tropical island communities are faced with making important decisions related to adaptation that could impact the health of important natural resources and ecosystems. However, a lack of scientific guidance and information complicates these efforts.  To help address this problem, the SE CSC project team will work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PRDNER), University of Puerto Rico, and North Carolina State University (NCSU) on improving the application of downscaled climate projections to help advance the recovery and conservation of amphibians in Puerto Rico. The USFWS and PRDNER seek to implement an adaptive conservation strategy to achieve recovery of three endangered frog species (of the genus Eleutherodactylus) and prevent federal listing of 14 other amphibians considered at risk. Implementation of the strategy requires identifying suitable habitat for the species at present and in the future, and ensuring the availability of field-tested protocols for locally supplementing, introducing, and translocating species as necessary.  The main objectives of this project are: (1) to develop an understanding of the eco-physiological limits of these species and the influence of those limits on extinction rates in local patches (i.e., heterogeneous micro-habitats within an ecosystem), and (2) to assess their adaptive capacity (i.e. the ability of the amphibians to adapt to changing environmental conditions). This will inform implementation of the conservation strategy, which is partly constrained by the availability of conservation areas that meet required eco-physiological conditions. This research will contribute to a decision framework developed by NCSU scientists that can assist decision makers in determining when and where to implement conservation actions to maximize species persistence.

FRAME-SIMPPLLE is a collaborative modeling process designed to accomplish this goal by coupling the adaptive capabilities of the SIMPPLLE modeling system with accepted principles of collaboration. The two essential components of the process are FRAME (Framing Research in support of the Adaptive Management of Ecosystems), which creates a collaborative problem-solving environment, and SIMPPLLE (SIMulating Patterns and Processes at Landscape Scales), which is a vegetation dynamics modeling system. The resulting collaborative modeling process allows decision makers to optimize the management of multiple resources and evaluate the likely outcome of various choices. The approach involves collaboratively engaging resource managers, modelers, and scientists in framing the science issues embedded in key natural resource management issues and then developing the SIMPPLLE modeling approach to address those issues. Through a prototype collaborative modeling effort at Mesa Verde National Park, a process has been developed for adaptive, multi-objective resource management. What is needed now is an effort to refine the approach and establish a transportable methodology that is applicable across a wide range of ecosystems. In the Northern Rockies, managers have expressed an interest in exploring this approach at Glacier National Park, the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem, and the Rocky Mountain Front. This project utilized and evaluated the FRAME-SIMPPLLE approach to (1) explore adaptive management for climate and landscape change in the Northern Rockies, (2) recommend how to foster the long-term development of such collaborative planning tools as a joint effort between the USGS and the Institute of the Environment; (3) develop graduate student mentoring opportunities focused on collaborative planning and adaptive management science, and (4) investigate the use of GIS to further landscape science and conservation, especially related to energy development.

Every spring, hundreds of birds migrate to their summer breeding grounds in Alaska and northern Canada. Their arrival is timed with the height of the spring green-up of plants, which provide the food necessary for birds to reproduce and raise their young. However, over the last fifty years, warming temperatures in Alaska as a result of climate change have prompted an earlier transition from winter to spring. The purpose of this project was to examine whether there have been changes in the timing of spring green-up in recent years (1985-2009) and, if so, whether migratory birds are adapting their migration schedules accordingly.    Researchers used historical satellite imagery and long-term records on bird migration and breeding from across Alaska to generate a series of maps and publications to answer these questions. They found that bird species ranged widely in their adaptation to earlier spring, with some doing better than others at timing their arrival with changing temperature. The researchers also used downscaled climate models to project how bird habitat will be affected by climate change through the 21st century. This information can be used by Alaska land managers to focus their conservation efforts on species or habitat areas that appear especially vulnerable.

One potential technique is the use of biochars (charcoal made from decomposition of organic matter at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen), which can be used as a soil amendment that can increase soil moisture retention, improve agricultural yields, and hold carbon in soil for long periods of time.  Despite the proliferation of studies aimed at understanding and characterizing biochars, general principles and agronomic recommendations have been slow to emerge.

Diagnostic plots demonstrated that in about half of the measurements sets, Kfs could be estimated by modeling infiltration as a two-term function of sorptivity and Kfs. In the remaining plots, additional unknown factors that influenced infiltration prevented estimation of Kfs, possibly due to air entrapment, soil layering, or ring insertion effects in the remaining experiments.

While the largest fires are often started by lightning and burn in remote areas, these fires require significant resources to fight when they threaten life and property.   Increased wildfire activity is projected to continue in Alaska, as climate conditions change. Therefore, understanding how to best calculate fire risk based on short and long-term weather conditions is needed to improve fire season forecasts. Currently, Alaska\u2019s fire managers rely on the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index to monitor and forecast fire danger. Several other indices also exist, but have not been fully assessed to determine their usability in Alaska. The goal of this project is to understand which index best forecasts wildfires in Alaska. Researchers will then use these indices to project future seasonal trends in wildfire over the next century.   This project will support Alaska\u2019s fire managers in better understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing fire weather indices and how fire danger may change under future climate projections.

Researchers will work directly with the people who manage and forecast wildfires in Alaska, to ensure that their research can inform direct action and helps to improve forecasting and decision-making. Improvements to fire season forecasting will enable fire managers to more effectively plan for upcoming fire seasons and better allocate limited funds and firefighting resources.

The code was developed in the R programming environment. The file \"sim_code.R\" contains the initialization of the parameters and analysis; the file \"pop_sim.ccp\" is a C++ program that executes the actual simulation and returns the results to R. We developed a hypothetical scenario in which a manager is tasked with control of invasive plants on 100 management units each 100 ha in size. 90 of these units were assumed to be under private management and 10 were assumed to be conservation units (i.e. under public management). For this problem we assumed that there were only two target species to control: leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) and yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris). These two species were identified of examples of species that are controlled within the LCC geography. They are also species for which there is some literature to help parameterize a model. We should note that this model is gross generalization and was not intended to provide insight into invasive species biology. Because this model is stochastic, we measured this objective as the number of years out of 50 that at least 50% of the units were uninfested. We arbitrarily chose the target of 50%, which could have been any value. However, we felt that because these species are so difficult to control, target of 50% was fairly attainable. The dynamics of the model assume that management units can either be infested with one of the species, both of them or none at all. We further assumed that once a unit was infested, the species immediately achieved some average density and began producing propagules. These propagules had to disperse some arbitrary distance before they could infest another unit. Once those seeds landed in an uninfested unit, there was some probability they would lead to an infestation. To describe infestation dynamics, we developed a model that was composed of eight states to describe the management units. The model simulates the dynamics of infestation and control and then produces an Expected Value of Information analysis that shows the improvement in performance given resolution of each uncertain parameter in the model.

These invasions often cause management agencies to incur high costs for prevention, control, restoration, and fire responses.   Control and prevention of invasive species is challenging because the risk of invasive plants becoming abundant depends on existing plant communities, climate and weather, land use, and fire history. Moreover, scientific information on invasion risk that does exist has not always been translated into maps that planners and resource managers can use in their decision making. Broad-scale information is needed to link geographic variation in climate and disturbances (e.g. fire) to decisions on the ground regarding where to apply treatments aimed at limiting the impacts of invasions and restoring native plant composition.   This project aims to use existing datasets to understand the links between the abundance of major plant invaders and climatic extremes, land use and fire history. The project team will examine how the drivers and limits of plant abundance vary among invasive species and across the Great Basin and Mojave Desert. For example, where is cheatgrass likely to be limited by drought and temperature extremes, and are those areas vulnerable to red brome invasion? Where should we be most concerned about annual grass invasion following wildfire? The project\u2019s main objectives are to (i) describe the climatic conditions under which plant invaders occur and reach high abundance; (ii) model spatial variation in the drivers of invader abundance; and (iii) develop map products linking risk of high invasive plant cover to resource management strategies (e.g. prevention, restoration, or tolerance).

While climate change challenges managers of both natural and cultural resources to make decisions in the face of uncertainty, far less work has been done to identify the impacts of climate change on cultural resources, compared to natural resources.    To address this critical gap, researchers are developing a strategy to aid decision makers in climate adaptation planning efforts.

Lichens will likely have a complex response to climate change, affected in different ways by factors like changing precipitation, wildfire, and competition with plants. For example, as temperatures warm, there will likely be less snow cover, exposing more of the lichen to caribou. Simultaneously, increased fire frequency could reduce lichen availability.  Moose, on the other hand, eat the twigs of deciduous shrubs that stick up above the snow. Unlike lichen, shrub habitats may actually be affected positively by increased fire. Warmer temperatures and less snow are also likely to increase shrub biomass.  Project researchers are using the Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Model to unravel some of these complex relationships and estimate the effects of climate change on food availability for these two species throughout most of Alaska and parts of Canada (from about 1970-2100).

Forage conditions in arid and semi-arid regions are driven by unpredictable spatial and temporal patterns in rainfall. Diet selection by herbivores should be directed towards overcoming the most pressing nutritional limitation (i.e. energy, protein [nitrogen, N], moisture) within the constraints imposed by temporal and spatial variability in forage conditions. We investigated the influence of precipitation-induced shifts in forage nutritional quality and subsequent large herbivore responses across widely varying precipitation conditions in an arid environment. Specifically, we assessed seasonal changes in diet breadth and forage selection of adult female desert bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis mexicana in relation to potential nutritional limitations in forage N, moisture and energy content (as proxied by dry matter digestibility, DMD). Succulents were consistently high in moisture but low in N and grasses were low in N and moisture until the wet period. Nitrogen and moisture content of shrubs and forbs varied among seasons and climatic periods, whereas trees had consistently high N and moderate moisture levels. Shrubs, trees and succulents composed most of the seasonal sheep diets but had little variation in DMD. Across all seasons during drought and during summer with average precipitation, forages selected by sheep were higher in N and moisture than that of available forage. Differences in DMD between sheep diets and available forage were minor. Diet breadth was lowest during drought and increased with precipitation, reflecting a reliance on few key forage species during drought. Overall, forage selection was more strongly associated with N and moisture content than energy content. Our study demonstrates that unlike north-temperate ungulates which are generally reported to be energy-limited, N and moisture may be more nutritionally limiting for desert ungulates than digestible energy. The purpose of this study was to assess potential nutritional limitations in available forage for desert bighorn sheep across widely varying precipitation conditions ranging from drought to wet periods in the Sonoran Desert.", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58f0feade4b06911a29fac29", "item_phrases": ["diet selection", "assess potential nutritional limitations", "whereas trees", "overall", "high n", "semi-arid regions", "specifically", "succulents", "pressing nutritional limitation", "seasonal changes", "north-temperate ungulates", "differences", "moisture content", "dry matter digestibility", "adult female desert bighorn sheep ovis canadensis mexicana", "little variation", "population dynamics", "large herbivore behaviour", "forage n", "average precipitation", "canadensis mexicana", "shrubs", "arid environment", "protein [ nitrogen", "forage nutritional quality", "climatic periods", "potential nutritional limitations", "energy content", "forage conditions", "across", "life history characteristics", "desert ungulates", "adult female desert bighorn sheep", "precipitation conditions", "diet", "dmd", "nitrogen", "subsequent large herbivore responses", "seasonal sheep diets", "available forage", "few key forage species", "forage", "diet breadth", "study demonstrates", "unpredictable spatial", "desert bighorn sheep", "ecology forms", "wet period", "sonoran", "key forage species", "nutritional limitation", "environmental variability", "nutritional", "ovis", "nutritional ecology forms", "wet periods", "temporal patterns", "forage selection", "sheep diets", "digestible energy", "sonoran desert", "spatial variability", "moderate moisture levels"], "weighted_sim": 0.6073, "avg_sim": 0.6311}}}, "5006e784e4b0abf7ce733f4d": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5006e784e4b0abf7ce733f4d", "proj_summary": " In the Pacific Northwest, land and resource managers strive to make decisions that benefit both natural and human communities, balancing ecological and economic demands including wildlife habitat, forest products, forage for grazing, clean water, and wildfire control. Climate change adds a layer of complexity to the planning process because of its uncertain effects on the environment. In order to make sound decisions, managers need information about how climate change will affect wildlife habitat, both on its own and in conjunction with management actions.  The goal of this project was to explore how future climate may interact with management alternatives to shape wildlife habitat across large landscapes. Scientists used computer simulations to investigate a range of future climate and management scenarios, focusing on habitat for two iconic species: the northern spotted owl and the greater sage-grouse.  Findings reveal that increasing wildfire is likely to be the primary threat to owl habitat as a result of climate change. Management actions that reduce the amount of vegetation available as fuel may be helpful at counteracting this threat, at least in southwestern Oregon. In the case of the greater sage-grouse, expected increases in wildfire may actually be helpful for managers, as they help to control the spread of juniper. However, invasive grasses are poised to overtake much of the landscape, creating a new management challenge.  While the task of managing habitat in the face of climate change is daunting, this research yielded information that may be useful for setting management priorities and developing strategies that sustain these landscapes for both humans and wildlife.

Path Landscape Model software, version 3.0.4. Later versions of the software cannot run these files. To get a copy of this software, please contact Apex RMS at path@apexrms.com. 1) \"Path Landscape Mode\" folder contains files to be run in the PLM softwarel, version 3.0.4 or later. Path models MUST be run with the provided MCM mulitplier files to apply the required transition probability adjustments for procesess such as insect outbreaks, wildfire, and climate change trends. Each Path database is set up with three folders: - The 'Common' folder contains a single Path scenario (also named 'Common'). The Transitions tab within the Common scenario contains the climate-smart STM. - The 'Multipliers' folder contains multipliers specific to each ownership-allocation to activate or deactivate transitions (both climate change and management). Actual treatments are input in the Treatments tab for each stratum in the 'Runs' folder. - The 'Runs' folder contains one Path scenario per modeling stratum, with initial conditions specific to each stratum (combination of watershed and ownership-allocation). The models are stored as a dependency from the 'Common' folder and the multipliers as a dependency from the 'Multipliers' scenario. For the scenarios that have management activities (current and restoration management), a specified number of acres for each treatment is shown in the Treatments tab for treated stata. There are 12 databases, one for each combintation of management and climate scenario run in southeast Oregon. Climate scenarios include: - No climate change - continuing current climate (NoCC) - HadGEM global circulation model, representative concentration pathway 8.5 (HadGEM) - NorESM global circulation model, representative concentration pathway 8.5 (NorESM) - MRI global circulation model, representative concentration pathway 8.5 (MRI) Management scenarios include: - No management - no restoration treatments (NoMgt) - Current management - current treatment rates compiled from managers in the region (CurMgt) - Restoration management - a restoration scenario to restore sage-grouse habitat (RestMgt) 2) The \"lookupTables\" folder contains files necessary for providing definitions and context for the information located in other folders. 3) The 'Spatial' folder contains the SEO region stratum map, called SEO_Modeling_Strata.tif. This map can be joined to output from the climate-informed state-and-transition models to map projected future condition or sage-grouse habitat on the \"Strata\" field. Modeling strata consist of the intersection of watershed (Hydrologic unit code [HUC]) and ownership-allocation map. Watersheds are three digit codes starting at 101. Ownership-allocation categories are a two-character label, and are described in the attribute table through the fields \"Ownership\", and \"Allocation\". The field ScenarioID indicates the internal ID number used by the Path software to link results for modeling strata to its Scenario names. 4) This folder contains summarized modeling results that can be viewed as nonspatial trends across the whole landscape or displayed across mapped modeling strata. The .tif file in the 3Spatial folder shows the spatial distribution of modeling strata. There are 3 subfolders: ClassesSummary, TransitionSummary, and HabitatSummary. The csv files within ClassesSummary contain summaries of state class area (in Acres) for each timestep, over monte carlo repetitions, within each modeling stratum. Those within TransitionSummary are summarized in the same manner, but contain summaries of area affected by each Transition Type. The csv files within HabitatSummary are designed to be joined ot the grid mentioned above, to allow for a spatial depiction of habitat projections. There is one column per modeled year, containing a summary that indicates the proportion of each modeling stratum that is comprised of potential greater sage grouse habitat (the general summary, not the high-quality summary, averaged over monte carlo repetitions). Sample queries outlining how to build new summaries of output data for mapping from the ClassesSummary files and lookup tables are included in the database: SEO_Summaries.accdb. Due to a minor error in starting conditions, summaries of sage-grouse habitat may be underestimated in the early years, especially within the northwestern quadrant of the map. Because of this, we have removed the summaries of the first four years within the Habitat summary files, and constrain the sample queries to only show projections for after 2011. If the early years of this summary data are needed for viewing other parts of the map, they can be constructed by removing a constraint within query1 of the sample queries shown above. Balancing socio-economic and ecological demands on forests is an ongoing challenge and may be further complicated by future changes in climate. Land managers need information on the potential effects of climate change for future management planning that considers the diversity of valuable natural resources (forest products, clean water, wildfire control, etc.) that are linked to vegetation. The objectives of this project are to explore how climate and land management in southwestern Oregon and coastal Washington might interact to shape future vegetation and wildlife habitat, and determine what management actions will likely maximize habitats for key species. Through computer simulations that are run under a range of future management and climate scenarios, this project will build upon a body of knowledge that can help inform management planning for a changing future, raising the likelihood that ecosystems can be sustained for both humans and wildlife.", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5aeb90a3e4b0860c0f727d05",

following files are designed to be run using the Path Landscape Model software, version 3.0.4. Later versions of the software cannot run these files. To get a copy of this software, please contact Apex RMS at path@apexrms.com. 1) Path models MUST be run with the provided .MCM and .trd mulitplier files to apply the required transition probability adjustments for procesess such as insect outbreaks, wildfire, and climate change trends. Each Path database is set up with three folders: - The 'Common' folder contains a single Path scenario (also named 'Common'). The Transitions tab within the Common scenario contains the climate-smart STM. - The 'Multipliers' folder contains multipliers specific to each ownership-allocation to activate or deactivate transitions (both climate change and management). Actual treatments are input in the Treatments tab for each stratum in the 'Runs' folder. - The 'Runs' folder contains one Path scenario per modeling stratum, with initial conditions specific to each stratum (combination of watershed and ownership-allocation). The models are stored as a dependency from the 'Common' folder and the multipliers as a dependency from the 'Multipliers' scenario. For the scenarios that have management activities (current and restoration management), a specified number of acres for each treatment is shown in the Treatments tab for treated stata. There are 6 databases, one for each combintation of management and climate scenario run in northwest Washington. Climate scenarios include: - No climate change - continuing current climate (NoCC) - Hadley global circulation model, A2 Emissions Scenario (Hadley) - RegCM3 regional circulation model, A2 Emissions Scenario (RegCM3) Management scenarios include: - No management - no restoration treatments (NoMgt) - Current management - current treatment rates compiled from managers in the region (CurMgt) 2) The lookup tables folder contains files necessary for providing definitions and context for the information located in other folders. 3) This folder contains the NWW region stratum map, called Modeling_Strata.tif. This map can be joined to output from the climate-informed state-and-transition models to map projected future condition or northern spotted owl habitat, on the \"Strata\" field. Modeling strata consist of the intersection of watershed (Hydrologic unit code [HUC]) and ownership-allocation map. Watersheds are three digit codes starting at 101. Ownership-allocation categories are a two-character label, and are described in the attribute table through the fields \"Ownership\", and \"Allocation\". The field ScenarioID indicates the internal ID number used by the Path software to link results for modeling strata to its Scenario names. 4) The \"Results\" folder contains summarized modeling results that can be viewed on their own, or displayed across mapped modeling strata. The .tif file within the 3Spatial folder shows the spatial distribution of modeling strata. There are 3 subfolders: ClassesSummary, TransitionSummary, and HabitatSummary. The csv files within ClassesSummary contain summaries of state class area (in Acres) for each timestep, over monte carlo repetitions, within each modeling stratum. Those within TransitionSummary are summarized in the same manner, but contain summaries of area affected by each Transition Type. The csv files within HabitatSummary are designed to be joined ot the grid mentioned above, to allow for a spatial depiction of habitat projections. There is one column per modeled year, containing a summary that indicates the proportion of each modeling stratum that is comprised of potential northern spotted owl habitat (averaged over monte carlo repetitions). Sample queries outlining how to build new summaries of output data for mapping from the ClassesSummary files and lookup tables are included in the database: NWW_Summaries.accdb. Balancing socio-economic and ecological demands on forests is an ongoing challenge and may be further complicated by future changes in climate. Land managers need information on the potential effects of climate change for future management planning that considers the diversity of valuable natural resources (forest products, clean water, wildfire control, etc.) that are linked to vegetation. The objectives of this project are to explore how climate and land management in southwestern Oregon and coastal Washington might interact to shape future vegetation and wildlife habitat, and determine what management actions will likely maximize habitats for key species.

While pronghorns are numerous in parts of their range, such as Wyoming and northern Colorado, they are endangered in others, such as the Sonoran Desert. In the arid Southwest, pronghorn populations have been declining since the 1980s\u2014and it\u2019s thought that drought is partially to blame.   Average temperatures in the Southwest have increased 1.6\u00b0C since 1901, and the area affected by drought from 2001-2010 was the second largest observed since 1901. Drought conditions have reduced the availability of vegetation, impacting the survival of pronghorns and putting the long-term viability of the species in question, as climate change models predict warmer and drier conditions for the region in the future.   This project seeks to understand the impacts of drought on pronghorn populations in the Southwest. Specific objectives of the study are to (1) determine the extent of pronghorn population decline; (2) identify the climatic factors that best explain these declines; and (3) use current climate change models to project how a changing climate may affect pronghorn populations in the future. So far, researchers have found that precipitation is strongly linked to pronghorn population growth, and that under future climate scenarios, 9 of 18 studied populations are projected to disappear by the end of the century.   The results of this project will assist wildlife managers in developing the most appropriate management strategy for pronghorns in the face of climate change and future drought conditions, thus contributing to the long-term conservation of this species in the Southwest.

areas may become unsuitable for species persistence. Unraveling the relationships between climate and population dynamics, and projecting them across time, advances ecological understanding that informs and steers sustainable conservation for species. Using pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) as an ecological model, we used a Bayesian approach to analyze long-term population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 subpopulations in the southwestern United States. We determined which long-term (12 and 24 months) or short-term (gestation trimester and lactation period) climatic conditions best predicted annual rate of population growth (\u03bb). We used these predictions to project population trends through 2090. Projections incorporated downscaled climatic data matched to pronghorn range for each population, given a high and a lower atmospheric CO2 concentration scenario. Since the 1990s, 15 of the pronghorn subpopulations declined in abundance. Sixteen subpopulations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and \u03bb, and in 13 of these, temperature was also significant. Precipitation predictors of \u03bb were highly seasonal, with lactation being the most important period, followed by early and late gestation. The influence of temperature on \u03bb was less seasonal than precipitation, and lacked a clear temporal pattern. The climatic projections indicated that all of these pronghorn subpopulations would experience increased temperatures, while the direction and magnitude of precipitation had high subpopulation-specific variation. Models predicted that nine subpopulations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. Results were consistent across both atmospheric CO2 concentration scenarios, indicating robustness of trends irrespective of climatic severity. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn subpopulations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence. This realization informs and steers conservation and management decisions for pronghorn in North America, while exemplifying how similar research can aid ungulates inhabiting arid regions and confronting similar circumstances elsewhere. Long-term data from annual aerial surveys of pronghorn subpopulations in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas were used to calculate annual rates of population growth (\u03bb). When subpopulation-specific harvest and translocation data were available, population estimates for calculating \u03bb were adjusted according to the following equation: \u03bbt = Nt/(Nt-1 - h - r + a), where \u03bbt is population change from time t-1 to t, Nt and Nt-1 are population estimates from current and previous surveys, respectively, h is number of pronghorn harvested, and r and a are number of individuals removed from and released into the population, respectively, through translocations. Only population estimates from surveys conducted in consecutive years were used to calculate \u03bb. If \u03bb = 2, the associated surveys were removed from analyses because \u03bb would be considered to be derived from unreliable or unstandardized population estimates, resulting in biologically unrealistic population growth rates. Monthly climate data (precipitation [mm/day] and mean temperature [degrees C]) were from 14 x 14 km cells from pronghorn range in each subpopulation in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas. Means across grids were calculated to obtain monthly values of precipitation and temperature. Two realistic future global climate scenarios were compared; a lower (Representative Concentrations Pathways 4.5) and a high (Representative Concentrations Pathways 8.5) atmospheric CO2 concentration scenario. Standardized precipitation index for 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month periods were calculated from all available monthly precipitation data using program SPI SL 6 (National Drought Mitigation Center 2014). Monthly mean temperature, total precipitation, and mean SPI (3-, 6-, and 12-month periods) were summarized by important periods in an adult female pronghorn's annual reproductive cycle relative to peak fawning (i.e., early, mid-, and late gestation [3 months each] and lactation [4 months]). Mean temperature and total precipitation were also calculated for 12 and 24 months preceding each population survey. Historic pronghorn population trends in relation to temperature and precipitation were assessed using integrated Bayesian population models. All models included a covariate for density effect (i.e., population in the previous year). Precipitation and temperature model comparison sets were run separately, and each model set included a null model (i.e., only density covariate, no climate covariates). These top individual precipitation and temperature covariates were then combined in models (i.e., one precipitation and temperature covariate per model), and these combined models were run including a term for the interaction between precipitation and temperature using the following equation: ln(\u03bbt) = Alpha + Beta1XN[t-1] + Beta2Xprec + Beta3Xtemp + Beta4Xprec*temp. Projected climate data for each pronghorn subpopulation was used to predict \u03bbt for each year to 2090. An integrated modeling approach was used, whereby the best performing model climatic predictors from historic population trends for each pronghorn subpopulation was embedded in that subpopulation pronghorn population projection model. The pronghorn population survey data were collected to estimate annual rate of population growth (\u03bb) for subpopulations described herein. Historic climate data (precipitation and temperature) were compiled to determine climatic predictors of annual rates of pronghorn population growth. Projected climate data were compiled to use these predictive relationships to estimate future pronghorn subpopulation annual growth, which were in turn used to calculate projected pronghorn subpopulation sizes.", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59d256ece4b05fe04cc235d2", "item_phrases": ["beta3xtemp", "historic climate data", "alpha", "mexico", "high

areas may become unsuitable for species persistence. Unraveling the relationships between climate and population dynamics, and projecting them across time, advances ecological understanding that informs and steers sustainable conservation for species. Using pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) as an ecological model, we used a Bayesian approach to analyze long-term population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 subpopulations in the southwestern United States. We determined which long-term (12 and 24 months) or short-term (gestation trimester and lactation period) climatic conditions best predicted annual rate of population growth (\u03bb). We used these predictions to project population trends through 2090. Projections incorporated downscaled climatic data matched to pronghorn range for each population, given a high and a lower atmospheric CO2 concentration scenario. Since the 1990s, 15 of the pronghorn subpopulations declined in abundance. Sixteen subpopulations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and \u03bb, and in 13 of these, temperature was also significant. Precipitation predictors of \u03bb were highly seasonal, with lactation being the most important period, followed by early and late gestation. The influence of temperature on \u03bb was less seasonal than precipitation, and lacked a clear temporal pattern. The climatic projections indicated that all of these pronghorn subpopulations would experience increased temperatures, while the direction and magnitude of precipitation had high subpopulation-specific variation. Models predicted that nine subpopulations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. Results were consistent across both atmospheric CO2 concentration scenarios, indicating robustness of trends irrespective of climatic severity. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn subpopulations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence. This realization informs and steers conservation and management decisions for pronghorn in North America, while exemplifying how similar research can aid ungulates inhabiting arid regions and confronting similar circumstances elsewhere. Long-term data from annual aerial surveys of pronghorn subpopulations in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas were used to calculate annual rates of population growth (\u03bb). When subpopulation-specific harvest and translocation data were available, population estimates for calculating \u03bb were adjusted according to the following equation: \u03bbt = Nt/(Nt-1 - h - r + a), where \u03bbt is population change from time t-1 to t, Nt and Nt-1 are population estimates from current and previous surveys, respectively, h is number of pronghorn harvested, and r and a are number of individuals removed from and released into the population, respectively, through translocations. Only population estimates from surveys conducted in consecutive years were used to calculate \u03bb. If \u03bb = 2, the associated surveys were removed from analyses because \u03bb would be considered to be derived from unreliable or unstandardized population estimates, resulting in biologically unrealistic population growth rates. Monthly climate data (precipitation [mm/day] and mean temperature [degrees C]) were from 14 x 14 km cells from pronghorn range in each subpopulation in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas. Means across grids were calculated to obtain monthly values of precipitation and temperature. Two realistic future global climate scenarios were compared; a lower (Representative Concentrations Pathways 4.5) and a high (Representative Concentrations Pathways 8.5) atmospheric CO2 concentration scenario. Standardized precipitation index for 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month periods were calculated from all available monthly precipitation data using program SPI SL 6 (National Drought Mitigation Center 2014). Monthly mean temperature, total precipitation, and mean SPI (3-, 6-, and 12-month periods) were summarized by important periods in an adult female pronghorn's annual reproductive cycle relative to peak fawning (i.e., early, mid-, and late gestation [3 months each] and lactation [4 months]). Mean temperature and total precipitation were also calculated for 12 and 24 months preceding each population survey. Historic pronghorn population trends in relation to temperature and precipitation were assessed using integrated Bayesian population models. All models included a covariate for density effect (i.e., population in the previous year). Precipitation and temperature model comparison sets were run separately, and each model set included a null model (i.e., only density covariate, no climate covariates). These top individual precipitation and temperature covariates were then combined in models (i.e., one precipitation and temperature covariate per model), and these combined models were run including a term for the interaction between precipitation and temperature using the following equation: ln(\u03bbt) = Alpha + Beta1XN[t-1] + Beta2Xprec + Beta3Xtemp + Beta4Xprec*temp. Projected climate data for each pronghorn subpopulation was used to predict \u03bbt for each year to 2090. An integrated modeling approach was used, whereby the best performing model climatic predictors from historic population trends for each pronghorn subpopulation was embedded in that subpopulation pronghorn population projection model. The pronghorn population survey data were collected to estimate annual rate of population growth (\u03bb) for subpopulations described herein. Historic climate data (precipitation and temperature) were compiled to determine climatic predictors of annual rates of pronghorn population growth. Projected climate data were compiled to use these predictive relationships to estimate future pronghorn subpopulation annual growth, which were in turn used to calculate projected pronghorn subpopulation sizes.", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59d254cce4b05fe04cc235b8", "item_phrases": ["beta3xtemp", "historic climate data", "alpha", "mexico", "high subpopulation-specific variation", "gestation trimester", "antilocapra americana", "precipitation predictors", "estimate annual rate", "temperature covariates", "calculate \u03bb", "program spi sl 6", "arid regions", "climatic data", "annual reproductive cycle", "km cells", "concentration scenario", "available monthly precipitation data", "population survey", "analyze long-term population", "precipitation [ mm/day ]", "model climatic predictors", "top individual precipitation", "predictive relationships", "sixteen", "pronghorn population survey data", "historic population trends", "annual rates", "atmospheric co2 concentration scenario", "precipitation", "total precipitation", "previous surveys", "significant relationship", "species persistence", "translocation data", "lower atmospheric co2 concentration scenario", "standardized precipitation index", "temperature model comparison sets", "climatic projections", "long-term data", "future pronghorn subpopulation", "two realistic future global climate scenarios", "late gestation", "bayesian", "12-month periods", "density covariate", "null model", "drought mitigation", "national drought mitigation center 2014", "previous year", "climatic conditions", "months ]", "climatic predictors", "\u03bb =", "similar research", "population dynamics", "estimate future pronghorn subpopulation annual growth", "climate data", "representative concentrations pathways 8.5", "climate underpinning pronghorn subpopulations", "management decisions", "pronghorn subpopulation sizes", "pronghorn subpopulation", "temperature model comparison", "temperature covariate", "annual rate", "advances ecological understanding", "annual growth", "lactation [", "nt/", "co2", "nt", "time t-1", "climate covariates", "lactation period", "atmospheric co2 concentration scenarios", "similar circumstances", "monthly", "concentrations pathways", "24-month periods", "adult female pronghorn", "standardized", "late gestation [", "population growth", "mean", "pronghorn subpopulations", "ecological model", "america", "population change", "beta1xn", "temperature [ degrees c ]", "subpopulation pronghorn population projection model", "bayesian population models", "population trends", "projected", "means", "clear temporal pattern", "annual aerial surveys", "precipitation index", "antilocapra", "monthly values", "consecutive years", "representative concentrations pathways 4.5", "annual reproductive cycle relative", "unraveling", "pronghorn persistence", "utah", "beta4xprec*temp", "climatic severity", "ungulate population dynamics", "spi", "historic", "realistic future", "western texas", "global climate scenarios", "pronghorn range", "nt-1", "nt/(nt-1", "\u03bbt =", "adult female pronghorn 's", "project population trends", "sustainable conservation", "[ t-1 ] +", "unrealistic population growth rates", "climate", "bayesian approach", "important period", "monthly climate data", "texas", "spi sl", "population models", "new mexico", "historic pronghorn population trends", "important periods", "r +", "steers conservation", "arizona", "population estimates", "density effect", "pronghorn population growth", "beta2xprec", "integrated modeling approach", "most important period", "projections", "subpopulation-specific harvest", "north america", "southwestern united states", "long-term population", "temperature data", "realization informs", "concentration scenarios", "pronghorn population trends"], "weighted_sim": 0.6164, "avg_sim": 0.6213}}}, "559eb2e7e4b0b94a64018fd9": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/559eb2e7e4b0b94a64018fd9", "proj_summary": "Coral ecosystems of West Maui support a vibrant tourism industry and provide tangible economic benefits to the community. Hawaiian nearshore reefs generate about $800 million in annual revenue, not including the ecosystem services they provide - such as critical habitat for diverse fish species and buffering coasts from storm surges. The Hawaiian economy depends on healthy coral ecosystems, yet reefs are currently facing multiple threats, including changing climate conditions, local land-based pollution, and sediment erosion.  Erosion of soils into nearshore coastal zones is a chief concern facing land managers in West Maui. Intermittent rainfall can carry sediment from sources such as dirt roads, agricultural fields, streambanks, and disturbed forests into estuaries and the ocean. These sediments can block light that corals need for photosynthesis, essentially smothering them. Sediment also affects coastal user enjoyment by reducing water quality.  The goal of this project was to map, monitor, and analyze recent and historic rainfall to estimate sources of sediment for watersheds in West Maui. Researchers described how much sediment was entering the water from different land-based sources, to create a sediment budget for two watersheds in West Maui. Researchers found that current sediment deposition into coastal waters is likely due to the erosion of streambank terraces located downstream of former agricultural fields. These terraces are remnants of old agricultural land management practices in which soil and rock waste were pushed from fields into streams. It\u2019s estimated that this source results in over 90 dump truck loads of fine sediment entering West Maui\u2019s nearshore environment each year.  The information gathered from this project has already been used to inform a tool for estimating streambank erosion and sediment runoff into coastal zones during rainfall events.

Sources of erosion include unimproved roads, fallow and active agricultural fields, disturbed forests, local development, and streambanks. This is the primary output dataset from this project, which mapped bank erosion hotspots, constructed a reconnaissance sediment budget for the West Maui watersheds, and constructed a calibrated decision-support model capable of estimating sediment reduction from management actions.   Mapping, field experiments, and analysis of recent and historic rainfall were used to estimate sources of land-based pollution for watersheds in West Maui, Hawaii, and UH translated these findings into a calibrated Bayesian Belief Network Model that estimates spatially explicit erosion under a range of scenarios and management alternatives.  An overall sediment budget was constructed for the watersheds, describing the proportion of sediment coming from each source. A sediment budget (see Dietrich and Dunne, 1978) is a table of sediment loads, typically arranged by geomorphic process, enabling users to focus mitigation on sediment sources about which they expect to be most concerned.  Findings from this field assessment were used to inform a decision-support model.

Summary:  Manual snow course observations were collected over WY 2012-2014 from four paired forest-open sites chosen to span a broad elevation range. Study sites were located in the upper McKenzie (McK) River watershed, approximately 100 km east of Corvallis, Oregon, on the western slope of the Cascade Range and in the Middle Fork Willamette (MFW) watershed, located to the south of the McKenzie.  The sites were designated based on elevation, with a range of 1110-1480 m.  Distributed snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) observations were collected via monthly manual snow courses from 1 November through 1 April and bi-weekly thereafter. Snow courses spanned 500 m of forested terrain and 500 m of adjacent open terrain.  Snow depth observations were collected approximately every 10 m and SWE was measured every 100 m along the snow courses with a federal snow sampler.  These data are raw observations and have not been quality controlled in any way.  Distance along the transect was estimated in the field.    OSU_SnowDepth Summary: 10-minute snow depth observations collected at OSU met stations in the upper McKenzie River Watershed and the Middle Fork Willamette Watershed during Water Years 2012-2014.  Each meterological tower was deployed to represent either a forested or an open area at a particular site, and generally the locations were paired, with a meterological station deployed in the forest and in the open area at a single site.  These data were collected in conjunction with manual snow course observations, and the meterological stations were located in the approximate center of each forest or open snow course transect.  These data have undergone basic quality control.  See manufacturer specifications for individual instruments to determine sensor accuracy.  This file was compiled from individual raw data files (named \"RawData.txt\" within each site and year directory) provided by OSU, along with metadata of site attributes.  We converted the Excel-based timestamp (seconds since origin) to a date, changed the NaN flags for missing data to NA, and added site attributes such as site name and cover.  We replaced positive values with NA, since snow depth values in raw data are negative (i.e., flipped, with some correction to use the height of the sensor as zero).  Thus, positive snow depth values in the raw data equal negative snow depth values.  Second, the sign of the data was switched to make them positive. Then, the smooth.m (MATLAB) function was used to roughly smooth the data, with a moving window of 50 points.  Third, outliers were removed.  All values higher than the smoothed values +10, were replaced with NA. In some cases, further single point outliers were removed.    OSU_Met Summary: Raw, 10-minute meteorological observations collected at OSU met stations in the upper McKenzie River Watershed and the Middle Fork Willamette Watershed during Water Years 2012-2014.  Each meterological tower was deployed to represent either a forested or an open area at a particular site, and generally the locations were paired, with a meterological station deployed in the forest and in the open area at a single site.  These data were collected in conjunction with manual snow course observations, and the meteorological stations were located in the approximate center of each forest or open snow course transect. These stations were deployed to collect numerous meteorological variables, of which snow depth and wind speed are included here.  These data are raw datalogger output and have not been quality controlled in any way.  See manufacturer specifications for individual instruments to determine sensor accuracy.  This file was compiled from individual raw data files (named \"RawData.txt\" within each site and year directory) provided by OSU, along with metadata of site attributes.  We converted the Excel-based timestamp (seconds since origin) to a date, changed the NaN and 7999 flags for missing data to NA, and added site attributes such as site name and cover.

However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management.

and meteorological data were collected at seven locations across the Lawler Landing site (elevation 880 m) from February to May of WY 2008.  A 70 m north-south oriented transect of 5 snow depth sensors was deployed to record sub-daily snow depth, with co-located meteorological instruments. The sensors traversed a 40 m long elliptical forest gap and the adjacent forest in both directions. The locations were the same as those used previously to quantify how shortwave and longwave radiation vary across a forest gap [Lawler and Link, 2011]. Two additional snow depth sensors and meteorological stations were deployed at \u201cinterior forest reference\u201d and \u201copen reference\u201d sites, situated 80 m southeast and 1200 m west, respectively, from the main transect. Whereas the forest reference site was similar to the surrounding forest, the open reference site was much more exposed than the forest gap.  These data are generally raw datalogger output and have not been quality controlled in any way unless specifically designated in the variable name.  See manufacturer specifications for individual instruments to determine sensor accuracy.  This file was compiled from individual raw data files provided by IU, along with approximate coordinates of the sensor locations. Collaborators at the University of Washington (Jessica Lundquist) converted the timestamp given in fractional julian days to a dates and added site attributes such as Location ID and cover.

Sensor data was collected half-hourly during February through May 2008. Sensor data collected at 7 different points. See location metadata and data citation for description of locations.  These data include raw values and values that were smoothed by Diana Carson, see data citation for details.

These location metadata are assocatied with each unique location identification, which ties to time series data.  See Figure 1 of data citation for schematic map of locations.

distributed snow depth and snow duration data were collected over two to four snow seasons during water years 2011-2014 in experimental forest plots within the Cedar River Municipal Watershed, 50 km east of Seattle, Washington, USA. These 40 m \u00d7 40 m forest plots, situated on the western slope of the Cascade Range, include un-thinned second-growth coniferous forest as control treatments, variable density thinned forests, forest gaps in which a 20 m diameter (approximately equivalent to one tree height) gap was cut in the middle of each plot, and old growth forest.

The other camera was deployed in the adjacent forest, approximately 60 m to the southeast of the SNOTEL.  This comparison of snow depth between the open and forest uses the daily snow depth data observed at the SNOTEL, rounded to 5cm, compared to the average of two pole values in the forest (read by eye from photos), also rounded to 5 cm.   These data have been processed, aggregated and rounded. Climate change is projected to cause earlier snowmelt, with potentially serious consequences for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and for municipal and agricultural water supplies. However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management.

It flows south from the snow-capped mountains of Colorado through the New Mexico desert, forms the border between Texas and Mexico, and empties into the Gulf of Mexico at Brownsville, Texas. The multi-national, multi-state, ecologically diverse nature of this river makes management of the resource a complex task, especially in the context of more frequent droughts, changes in land use patterns, and increasing water use needs.  The main objective of this project was to assess the state of water resources management policies and planning tools for the Lower Rio Grande-Rio Bravo Basin. The project researchers developed an inventory of water management information and compiled a list of all the available models that can be used to evaluate human and environmental water management objectives. As part of this effort, the team identified the applicability of those models to evaluating trade-offs for meeting societal and environmental flow requirements to restore native ecosystems. They also identified information gaps that merit additional research and resources and described promising future steps to integrate and improve existing systems models.  Findings from this research show that there are a variety of models that can assist planning activities to implement environmental flows across the Basin. However, no models with the appropriate spatial extent and the necessary time-step exist for developing operational environmental flow targets in the basin. This work provides water resource managers with valuable insight as they work to balance human and ecological water needs throughout the basin.

Yet few tools for monitoring water movement patterns (hydrology) in and out of these landscapes currently exist, hindering efforts to model how they are changing.   This project provided data on wetland locations, historical hydrologic dynamics, and projected climate change impacts by analyzing flooding and drying patterns for thousands of wetlands in the Columbia Plateau from 1984 to 2011. The data describes the change between historical and future projected wetland patterns across the region. Researchers found that wetlands in the region will respond differently to projected changes in climate. Groundwater-driven wetlands, which tend to be more permanently flooded, may see increases in water levels and dry less frequently. Surface-water-driven wetlands, which flood seasonally, may see a decrease in surface-water levels, dry more frequently, and dry earlier in the season.   Understanding how changes in climate could impact depressional wetland dynamics is critical for sustainable management and conservation in dry areas like the Columbia Plateau. To ensure usability, researchers provided guidance on using the data to federal and state agencies, tribes, universities, and nonprofit organizations, such as Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge, Foster Creek Conservation District, and the Natural Resources Department of Yakama Nation. This information can help managers explore how management strategies may need to adapt, given the expected future changes in wetland hydrology in the region. Specific activities that could be informed by this data include the management of vegetation to increase water yield, fencing and grazing management around wetlands, and the management of wildlife that use wetlands.", "proj_phrases": ["surface water", "wetland locations", "climate change impacts", "yakama nation", "groundwater-driven", "foster creek", "researchers", "summer months", "wetland hydrology", "turnbull national wildlife refuge", "important source", "depressional wetlands", "dry areas", "columbia plateau", "monitoring water movement patterns", "water movement patterns", "wetland patterns", "increase water", "arid regions", "ensure usability", "conservation district", "climate change", "natural resources department", "historical hydrologic dynamics", "sustainable management", "nonprofit organizations", "resources", "surface-water-driven", "management strategies", "water yield", "state agencies", "turnbull", "understanding", "managers explore", "specific", "topographic depressions", "impact depressional wetland dynamics", "future changes", "water levels", "surface-water levels", "foster creek conservation district", "wildlife refuge"], "num_items": 1, "avg_item_sim": 0.6439, "proj_items": {"59dd56a0e4b05fe04ccbda56": {"similarities": [["climate change impacts", "climate change impacts", 1.0], ["climate change impacts", "climate change", 0.7778], ["climate change impacts", "future changes", 0.5556], ["climate", "columbia plateau", 0.5217], ["climate", "climate change", 0.6667], ["model climate impacts", "climate change impacts", 0.6977], ["model climate impacts", "climate change", 0.5143], ["understanding full picture", "understanding", 0.6667], ["cp ecoregion", "arid regions", 0.5833], ["long-term hydrological dynamics", "historical hydrologic dynamics", 0.6885], ["wetland location", "wetland locations", 0.9697], ["wetland location", "wetland hydrology", 0.6061], ["wetland location", "wetland patterns", 0.6875], ["arid regions", "arid regions", 1.0], ["arid regions", "topographic depressions", 0.5143], ["hydrologic dynamics", "historical hydrologic dynamics", 0.7755], ["climate change", "climate change impacts", 0.7778], ["climate change", "climate change", 1.0], ["climate change", "future changes", 0.6429], ["historical hydrologic dynamics", "wetland hydrology", 0.5106], ["historical hydrologic dynamics", "historical hydrologic dynamics", 1.0], ["sustainable management", "sustainable management", 1.0], ["plan conservation actions", "wetland locations", 0.5238], ["plan conservation actions", "conservation district", 0.6522], ["plan conservation actions", "foster creek conservation district", 0.5424], ["regional trends", "depressional wetlands", 0.6667], ["regional trends", "arid regions", 0.5185], ["spatial distribution", "conservation district", 0.5854], ["particular wetlands", "depressional wetlands", 0.6], ["particular wetlands", "impact depressional wetland dynamics", 0.5091], ["wetland function", "wetland locations", 0.7879], ["wetland function", "wetland hydrology", 0.5455], ["wetland function", "wetland patterns", 0.5625], ["\u2013 conservation goals", "conservation district", 0.6829], ["\u2013 conservation goals", "foster creek conservation district", 0.5556], ["wetland ecosystems", "wetland locations", 0.6286], ["wetland ecosystems", "wetland hydrology", 0.5714], ["wetland ecosystems", "wetland patterns", 0.6471], ["wetland conservation efforts", "wetland locations", 0.6667], ["wetland conservation efforts", "conservation district", 0.6122], ["wetland conservation efforts", "foster creek conservation district", 0.5484], ["historical hydrological dynamics", "historical hydrologic dynamics", 0.9677], ["climate-smart conservation", "conservation district", 0.5106], ["climate-smart conservation", "climate change", 0.55], ["climate-smart conservation", "foster creek conservation district", 0.5333], ["conservation actions", "conservation district", 0.7317], ["conservation actions", "foster creek conservation district", 0.5556], ["wetland dynamics", "wetland locations", 0.6061], ["wetland dynamics", "wetland hydrology", 0.6061], ["wetland dynamics", "wetland patterns", 0.625], ["wetland dynamics", "historical hydrologic dynamics", 0.5217], ["wetland dynamics", "impact depressional wetland dynamics", 0.6154]], "item_summary": "As the impacts of climate change amplify, understanding the consequences for wetland dynamics will be critical for their sustainable management and conservation, particularly in arid regions such as the CP ecoregion.

Though these data may exist for particular wetlands, there are no wall-to-wall consistent datasets of wetland location and long-term hydrological dynamics. Climate change has emphasized the growing need to plan conservation actions across large landscapes and at a longer-term time scales.

Warming temperatures may have a significant impact on snow and may therefore affect the entire water cycle of the region.

Understanding these changes is then critical for understanding and predicting a variety of climate impacts to wildlife and ecosystems. However, little research has been conducted to date to understand how this change may impact high-latitude ecosystems, and, unfortunately, traditional methods used by scientists to measure and characterize drought do not apply to snowfall-dominated areas.

This project will use existing datasets (e.g. ground observations, remote sensing, and computer models) to understand the arrival and departure of snowpack and the speed that the snow is melting, and to observe how changing landscapes and ecosystems, including the occurrence of fire, might be impacting snow accumulation and melt.

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes. The percentage of lakes with abundant largemouth bass and failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 59% in contemporary conditions to 86% of lakes by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the number of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 8.5% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 38 1% of lakes in both future periods.

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes. The percentage of lakes with abundant largemouth bass and failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 59% in contemporary conditions to 86% of lakes by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the number of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 8.5% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 38 1% of lakes in both future periods. Importantly, we identify nearly 100 resilient lakes predicted to continue to support walleye recruitment. Management resources could target preserving these resilient walleye populations.

To measure air temperature at biologically relevant scales in the field, ecologists often use small, portable temperature sensors. These sensors must be shielded from solar radiation to provide accurate temperature measurements, but a review of 18 years of ecological literature indicated that shielding practices vary across studies (when the shielding is reported at all), and that ecologists often invent and construct ad-hoc radiation shields without testing their efficacy.  The project researchers performed two field experiments to examine the accuracy of temperature observations from three commonly used portable data loggers (HOBO Pro, HOBO Pendant, and iButton hygrochron) housed in manufactured Gill shields or ad-hoc, custom-fabricated shields constructed from everyday materials such as plastic cups. They installed replicates of this array of sensors (11 sensor-shield combinations) at 5 different sites at weather stations located in open and forested sites. The team found that HOBO Pro sensors with Gill shields were the most accurate devices. Error in ad-hoc shield treatments ranged from 0.8 to 3.0 \u00b0C, with the largest errors at the open site.  They also deployed one replicate of each sensor-shield combination at five sites that varied in the amount of urban impervious surface cover, which presents a further shielding challenge. Results showed that bias in the sensors with ad-hoc shields increased by up to 0.7 \u00b0C for every 10% increase in impervious surface.  This study shows that, due to variable shielding practices, the ecological literature likely includes highly biased temperature data that cannot be compared directly across studies.

During periods of drought, cloud-water interception, or fog drip (the process by which water droplets accumulate on the leaves and branches of plants and then drip to the ground) in Hawai\u2018i\u2019s rain forests may play an important role in providing moisture for plants, reducing wildfire risk within the fog zone, and contributing to groundwater recharge (the process by which water moves downward from the surface through the ground to the groundwater table) that sustains water flow in streams during dry periods. Estimates of the changes in water availability during periods of drought are critical to Hawai\u2018i\u2019s water, forest, and wildfire managers and planners, as well as to agriculturists and ranchers for developing adaptive management strategies.  This study addresses this specific information need and will lead to a better understanding of the hydrologic impacts of drought throughout the State of Hawai\u2018i. Specific objectives of the study are (1) to estimate changes in soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge during periods of drought for current and projected climate conditions, and (2) to estimate the combined impact of drought and reduced fog drip on soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge.  The results from this study will inform resource managers of the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and the importance of fog drip in mitigating the impacts of drought. This study will also provide needed input for supporting science-based strategies for managing critical groundwater recharge areas and identifying areas vulnerable to wildfires. The results will be a great value to forest and water-resource managers, watershed partnerships striving to protect, preserve, and restore large areas of forested watersheds for water-resource and conservation values, and outreach agents seeking to reduce the threat of wildfire to ecosystems and communities by facilitating the sharing of fire knowledge.

Already, residents are facing extreme high tides and 16 foot swells that flood the islands with saltwater, damaging homes and infrastructure and contaminating the freshwater supply.  Land elevation is the primary factor that determines the vulnerability of coastal areas to inundation. This project builds on previous work in which a 1-meter resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was developed for Majuro Atoll, home to the capital and largest city in the Marshall Islands. Researchers will use this DEM to map areas of Majuro Atoll that are vulnerable to inundation, based on different water level scenarios. For example, these maps can be used to answer the question of which areas would flood should seas rise by 0.4, 0.8, or 1 meter, and will represent the first detailed assessment of sea-level rise vulnerability for Majuro.  The results of this project will support assessments of how future inundation events could impact ecosystems, infrastructure, the freshwater supply, and agroforestry on Majuro Atoll.

Found in eleven western states, this important yet fragile ecosystem is dominated by sagebrush, but also contains a diversity of native shrubs, grasses, and flowering plants. It provides critical habitat for wildlife like pronghorn and threatened species such as the greater sage-grouse, and is grazed by livestock on public and private lands. However, this landscape is increasingly threatened by shifts in wildfire patterns, the spread of invasive grasses, and changing climate conditions. While sagebrush is slow to recover after fires, non-native grasses such as cheatgrass thrive in post-fire conditions and the spread of these species can increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires. These changes to the sagebrush ecosystems have implications for big game, threatened wildlife, and ranching.  To address this growing concern, resource managers will often try to limit the spread of exotic grasses after fire events by applying herbicides, or will help native species recover through seeding or planting. However, these treatments have mixed results, and poor success is often attributed to droughts, which make it more difficult for seeds and native plants to survive; to the limited amount of time in which these treatments can be applied (usually in the first year after a fire); or because the seeds or plants used aren\u2019t adapted to the environmental conditions of the location where they\u2019re applied.  The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the factors that affect post-fire treatment success. Researchers will use data collected from more than 300 fires over the last 40 years, after which treatments were applied. They will identify the impacts of drought on those treatments, how incorporating information on drought forecasts or extending the period over which treatments are applied could have altered the outcomes, and how managers can better select plant material that will be more adaptable to the conditions of planting locations. Addressing this knowledge gap has been identified as a high priority in the DOI Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy, by the BLM Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation Program, and by state management agencies in the West. The results of this project will support adaptive management of sagebrush ecosystems, which will be critical if these ecologically and economically important landscapes are to be maintained into the future.

Cheatgrass dominated areas experience more fires that burn more land than in native ecosystems, resulting in economic and resource losses. Therefore, the reduced production, or absence, of cheatgrass in previously invaded areas during years of adequate precipitation could be seen as a windfall. However, this cheatgrass dieoff phenomenon creates other problems for land managers like accelerated soil erosion, loss of early spring food supply for livestock and wildlife, and unknown recovery pathways. We used satellite data and scientific techniques to map annual estimated cheatgrass percent cover and areas of cheatgrass dieoff in the western and central parts of the northern Great Basin from 2000 - 2010. For this same area, we developed a map of cheatgrass percent cover variability and another map that displays cheatgrass dieoff probability.  These maps can assist land managers in understanding when and where cheatgrass did and did not exist over an extremely large landscape, and the maps can possibly explain characteristics of dieoff areas that can help researchers pinpoint the cause or causes of cheatgrass dieoff. The cheatgrass dieoff maps show that dieoff areas are spatially and temporally variable, or, in other words, a dieoff may afflict an area for a few years and then cheatgrass may return, only to dieoff again later. This pattern of variability can also persist in different areas. During the study period we estimated that, on average, about 2.6 million acres experienced cheatgrass dieoff annually.Restoring dieoff areas to a native ecosystem could be a goal of land managers, but until cheatgrass dieoff causes and natural recovery pathways are better understood, engaging in costly restoration activities may be unwise.

resolution. The dataset was generated by integrating eMODIS NDVI satellite data with independent variables that influence cheatgrass germination and growth into a regression-tree model. Individual pixel values range from 0 to 100 with an overall mean value of 9.85 and a standard deviation of 12.78. A mask covers areas not classified as shrub/scrub or grass/herbaceous by the 2001 National Land Cover Database. The mask also covers areas higher than 2000 meters in elevation because cheatgrass is unlikely to exist at more than 2% cover above this threshold. Cheatgrass is an invasive grass that has invaded much of the Great Basin. It grows from seed, usually early in spring, and rapidly matures, produces seed, and dies. Its presence can deplete early-season moisture reserves and put native vegetation at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, it contributes fine fuels that facilitate fire ignition and fire spread. Rangeland fires are often stand replacing events in sagebrush communities, commuities which historically dominated much of the northern Great Basin. Increasing fire return intervals, increasing fire intensities, land management practices, and development have all contributed to the fragmentation of sagebrush ecosystems, which are critical for greater sagegrouse survival. This dataset is designed to provide a near-real-time estimate of cheatgrass in the northern Great Basin for 2015 to optimize land management efforts to control cheatgrass, preserve critical greater sagegrouse habitat, and inform fire control and prevention. Timely maps of dynamic cheatgrass percent cover are needed in early summer for these purposes. Research shows that cheatgrass percent cover is spatially and temporally highly variable in arid and semiarid environments because cheatgrass germination and growth is highly sensitive to annual weather, especially precipitation totals and timing. Precipitation totals and timing are also spatially and temporally highly variable in these environments; therefore, this dataset is only representative of cheatgrass percent cover during 2015 and does not represent any other time period.", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55ad3a16e4b066a2492409d5", "item_phrases": ["time period", "satellite data", "critical greater sagegrouse habitat", "research", "deplete early-season moisture reserves", "fire ignition", "sagebrush ecosystems", "annual weather", "invasive grass", "early-season moisture reserves", "sagebrush communities", "rangeland fires", "great basin", "meter spatial resolution", "fire spread", "cheatgrass percent", "competitive disadvantage", "influence cheatgrass germination", "database", "greater sagegrouse survival", "semiarid environments", "2001 national land cover database", "early summer", "control cheatgrass", "independent variables", "contributes fine", "optimize land management efforts", "fire intensities", "near-real-time estimate", "facilitate fire ignition", "native vegetation", "fire control", "fire return intervals", "ndvi", "sagegrouse habitat", "250 meter spatial resolution", "rangeland", "land management practices", "timely", "northern great basin", "research shows", "pixel values range", "precipitation", "land", "standard deviation", "cheatgrass germination", "emodis ndvi satellite data", "regression-tree model", "dynamic cheatgrass percent", "other time period", "sagegrouse survival", "cheatgrass", "individual pixel values range", "2015 cheatgrass percent", "land management efforts"], "weighted_sim": 0.6098, "avg_sim": 0.6198}}}, "5006e94ee4b0abf7ce733f56": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5006e94ee4b0abf7ce733f56", "proj_summary": "What will the rivers of the Pacific Northwest look like in the future? Will they be stable or unstable? Will the waters be cold and clear or warm and muddy? Will they have salmon or other species? These questions motivated our two-year study of climate warming effects on headwater streams draining the Cascade Mountains. Using a novel combination of snow, geohydrology, and sediment transport models we assessed the vulnerability of stream channels to changing peak streamflow. Our snow modeling shows that with just a 2\u00b0C warming, snowfall shifts to rainfall at all elevations, peak snowpacks occur over two months earlier, and snowpacks are reduced by over half of historical values. Our geohydrology modeling shows that greater rainfall and earlier snowmelt enhances peak winter streamflows but impacts depend on snow amount and watershed geohydrology. In spring-fed watersheds, increased winter flows are within historical bounds. In runoff-dominated watersheds, increased winter flows will exceed the historical range by up to 44% and the frequency of high flows will increase by over 100 days per year. Since streambed gravels and sand are transported during high flows, climate warming is likely to result in a dramatic increase in the amount of sediment moving through Cascade streams. Daily sediment transport rates in the surface-runoff system could potentially double. Besides affecting water quality with increased levels of suspended sediment, more frequent sediment transport events may lead to instability in the gravels where bull trout and salmon lay their eggs, making their survival less certain in the future. A key aspect of this project was engaging managers through a knowledge- to-action approach. Stakeholder dialogues were held in organized workshops and informal discussions through which we shared needs, information, and knowledge to interpret the consequences of these projected changes for water supply, threatened and endangered aquatic species, and dam operations.

Many different organizations make observations that are relevant to understanding global change processes, but the data are often not easily discoverable by other interested scientists and managers. This project aimed to pull into a centralized location information about many of these observational networks. In this phase of the project, a publicly available web-based portal was developed that provides a means to discover, search, and connect to many types of environmental and biological data collected in the southeastern United States that are relevant to characterizing potential effects of climate and land use change on land, water, and wildlife.  The Global Change Monitoring Portal (GCMP) consolidates information about data resources from research and monitoring done by federal, state, tribal, local, and non-governmental organizations; it provides opportunities for discovery by users who are land managers, scientists, tribal and other leaders, decision-makers, and citizens.

Therefore, characterizing long term vegetation cycles can provide critical insight into how the behavior and health of a number of species may be altered due to climate change.   This project seeks to identify how drought conditions influence vegetation phenology, in order to better understand the potential effects on herbivores. Specifically, researchers will examine (1) if drought causes spring  green-up to occur earlier in the year; (2) if drought causes a shorter spring green-up period, thus reducing the window during which high-quality vegetation is available for herbivores; and (3) how the spatial patterns of plant productivity vary during drought years.   Identifying the effects of drought on vegetation will help wildlife managers better understand and predict changes in the behavior and health of herbivores during periods of drought.

Herbivore species such as elk, moose, and deer depend on the availability of herbaceous plants and deciduous shrubs for forage. These vegetation types are most nutritious for herbivores from early season to peak green-up, so characterizing vegetation cycles, or phenology, over the long term can provide crucial information towards understanding how shifts in climate could affect the behavior and health of the herbivores.

The possibility of climate change has these communities further concerned, primarily because they do not know what to expect. Previously, the USGS, both Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations collaborated on a project to apply a range of possible climate change scenarios to the Red River watershed to determine future water availability.

Reduced precipitation can also lead to lower water levels in streams and losses in the vegetation that grows alongside riverbanks.   The goal of this project was to identify how hydrologic systems in the Southwest might respond to changes in climate and the degree to which this response is dependent on the characteristics of the hydrologic system. To do this, researchers developed a tool that simulates how quickly water moves from the surface to underground aquifers.  The tool helps identify timeframes and regions where seepage of water into aquifers is likely constant, rather than fluctuating with rainfall patterns or climate. By locating these areas upfront, researchers can exclude them from their analysis and focus water supply forecasting efforts on areas where groundwater is more likely to be affected by changes in rainfall or human uses at the surface.   The model shows that areas with a shallower water table tend to have more variability in the rate at which groundwater supplies are replenished, with secondary effects related to the soil type and the period of variation. In these areas, changes in rainfall and water withdrawal for irrigation or urban use have a bigger impact on groundwater availability. Water resource managers can use this tool to more accurately forecast how much groundwater remains in different watersheds and to determine which systems will be most sensitive to changes in climate and water use. The need for better forecasting is only increasing, as aquifers are increasingly tapped and precipitation patterns are expected to become more variable.

Further, future climatic changes will continue to affect human land-use, temperature, and water flows. Natural resource managers need to identify and prioritize habitats so that limited time and funding can be focused on habitats that are in most need of protection both now and in the future, based on projected climate changes. This project was comprised of a team of scientists from the US Geological Survey, Kansas State University, Michigan State University, Penn State University, the University of Minnesota-Duluth, the University of Washington, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Researchers modeled anticipated changes in fish habitat using downscaled global climate change models to predict alterations of water temperature, hydrology, and land-use under different possible scenarios. This project worked closely with the existing partnership-driven National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHAP) to link global climate change models and predicted land-use changes to the Nation\u2019s aquatic habitats. The effects of climate change on fish and fish habitat was conducted at three spatial scales. First, a coarse-scale nationwide assessment of how habitat will change with climate was conducted. Second, we used data specific to selected U.S. regions to refine our predicted changes in fish habitat among varying climate and land-use patterns in the Desert Southwest, the Rocky Mountain West, the Northern Glacial Lakes, and the Northeast U.S., and different aquatic systems such as warmwater rivers, glacial lakes, and coldwater streams. Finally, we also determined how selected fish distributions may change with altered climate. For example, the coldwater habitat needed for cisco in lakes in the Upper Midwest is diminishing and may affect the distribution of this critical species. We provided state and federal agencies, non-government organizations, and other stakeholders with GIS-based maps at national and regional scales, showing how habitat will change with climate and land-use change, and information on how those changes affect fish populations. A final report synthesizing this large effort was produced and distributed to all interested stakeholders, in addition to peer-reviewed publications for the scientific community. Lastly, the project trained five PhD students and post doctoral researchers so that these students can continue in their professional careers, helping resource managers deal with the effects of climate change. The project leveraged over $1 million in current partnership-driven nationwide and regional fish habitat assessments through the 300-member NFHAP. The results from this study will allow agencies to assess risks and determine how they will manage fish habitat and fish communities in a changing climate.

Major questions concerning which species will prosper, where they will prosper, and what this will mean for resource management remain unanswered. This uncertainty presents a significant challenge to managers working to conserve and restore at-risk species, and hampers strategic economic development in the Columbia River Basin. To address these limitations, researchers will use existing data collected by federal and tribal natural resource agencies to predict where five problematic invasive fish species \u2013 brook trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, and northern pike \u2013 will likely proliferate under future climate conditions and where they may impact native salmon and trout populations. Using this information, researchers will assess adaptation strategies that could help slow, stop, or prevent the establishment and spread of invasive fish, such as habitat restoration and active invasive species suppression.   The results of this project will be made available through an interactive web visualization tool, providing fisheries managers and conservationists with accessible science on the risk of invasive species establishment, the vulnerability of native fish, and potential adaptation strategies.

forests (e.g., forest management plans, fire management plans and policies, climate change strategy documents) written between 1986-2015, and categorized the ways in which fire-related climate adaptation actions appear in these documents.  A coding system was created to review and catalog how climate adaptation actions appear in each document. Each document was reviewed and scored based on a 0-2 scale with 0 indicating no presence of climate adaptation action(s) within the document, 1 indicating presence of climate adaptation action(s) within the document, and 2 indicating climate adaptation action(s) are the focus/priority of the document. Each document was reviewed by 2 staff. Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing natural resource management. The disruptions it is causing require that we change the way we consider conservation and resource management in order to ensure the future of habitats, species, and human communities. Practitioners often struggle with how to identify and prioritize specific climate adaptation actions (CAAs). Management actions may have a higher probability of being successful if they are informed by available scientific knowledge and findings; a systematic review process provides a mechanism to scientifically assess management questions. By evaluating specific actions on scientific knowledge and findings, we may be able to increase management effectiveness and efficiency. The goal of the Available Science Assessment Project (ASAP) is to synthesize and evaluate the body of scientific knowledge on specific, on-the-ground CAAs to determine the conditions, timeframes, and geographic areas where particular CAAs may be most effective for resource managers.

The SAMBI DSL project used predicted urban growth models described herein to inform future landscape conditions that were also based climate change impacts and vegetative community succession. These future landscape conditions were then applied as a context for land use and management decisions in conservation planning.  SLEUTH, named for the model input datasets (Slope, Land use, Excluded, Urban, Transportation and Hillshade) is the evolutionary product of the Clarke Urban Growth Model that uses cellular automata, terrain mapping and land cover change modeling to address urban growth (Jantz et al, 2009; NCGIA 2011). SLEUTH provides urban growth projections which are useful across a range of applications; including wildlife habitat analysis, conservation planning, and land cover dynamics analysis. SLEUTH incorporates four growth rules (Spontaneous Growth, New Spreading Centers, Edge Growth and Road-Influenced Growth) to model the rate and pattern of urbanization. The model simulates not only outward growth of existing urban areas, but also growth along transportation corridors and new centers of urbanization. SLEUTH incorporates five parameters (Dispersion, Breed, Spread, Slope and Road Gravity) into the growth rules which project future urbanization. Possible parameter coefficient values range between 1 and 100. During calibration every possible combination of these five parameter coefficients (between defined start and stop values and by a defined step size) is applied to the growth rules, in order to find the combination that best matches past urbanization patterns observed in the training data. Once found, the model is run in prediction mode using these parameter values in the growth rules. The model produces one urban growth cycle per year. For each growth cycle, a GIF image is produced showing the probability of urbanization for each pixel.

Future time period data are from three global climate models (GCMs): CGCM, GFDL, and HadCM3.

This project sought to understand the ways in which Native American culture and cultural practices in the northwestern U.S. have been affected by climate change. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with tribal elders and cultural experts belonging to three Northwest tribes \u2013 the Confederated Tribes of Salish and Kootenai, the Qinault Indian Nation, and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians.  Researchers found that, in addition to altering some specific cultural practices, climate change is profoundly disrupting tribal identities. For tribes, one of the most significant effects of climate change is disturbance to the timing of natural cycles and seasonal changes, which have historically served as cues for culturally important activities. Many of the interviewees described a sense of unease associated with the fact that traditional wisdom may no longer be a sound basis for decision making, because environmental situations no longer match the information that has been passed down through generations. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the cultural effects of climate change on Northwest tribes and may serve as a resource for tribes to assess climate change impacts on their practices and identity.

In response to warming winter temperatures, mangroves, which are dominant in warmer climates, are expected to continue migrating northward at the expense of salt marshes, which fare better in cooler climates. The ecological implications and timing of mangrove expansion is not well understood, and coastal wetland managers need information and tools that will enable them to identify and forecast the ecological impacts of this shift from salt marsh to mangrove-dominated coastal ecosystems.  To address this need, researchers will host workshops and leverage existing collaborations with scientists across the northern Gulf of Mexico to develop products that are relevant to resource managers within this transition zone between mangrove forests and salt marshes. First, researchers will leverage a community-curated data network called the Mangrove Migration Network to examine temperature thresholds for damage and mortality for several mangrove species that are common to the region. The winter of 2017-2018 in particular, during which extreme winter temperatures were experienced in the northern Gulf of Mexico, presents an outstanding opportunity to improve our ability to forecast the effects of changing winter temperature extremes on coastal wetlands. Researchers will integrate data from the Gulf of Mexico Mangrove Migration Network to assess the vulnerability of coastal wetlands to changing winter temperature extremes. Second, three workshops will be held with managers throughout the region to identify issues related to mangrove restoration and management in coastal wetlands in Texas, Louisiana, and north Florida. The results of this effort will help federal and state land managers better understand what is happening on the lands they manage, and evaluate alternative management and restoration activities that involve migrating mangroves.

As a result, land managers are becoming increasingly concerned about how climate change is affecting natural resources and the essential services they provide communities.   The rates and ecological impacts of changing conditions vary across this diverse region, which stretches from the Great Plains to the High Rockies. The goal of this project is to understand how native grasslands, shrublands, and forests will respond to changing conditions. Researchers will first model how these vegetation types have changed over the past 50 years, then will project how they might change over the next century under different possible future conditions.   Understanding how these native ecosystems may change is critical, particularly in light of the wildlife and communities that depend on them. Species such as the greater sage-grouse, elk, deer, and grizzly bears could lose important habitat if conditions change. Humans could also be impacted \u2013 subalpine forests, for example, control snow accumulation and melt, which in turn affect the water supply. The results of this research will be used to support local stakeholders in developing strategies for coping with and adapting to projected changes in vegetation across the North Central region.   This project team is part of the North Central Climate Science Center\u2019s Foundational Science Area Team, which supports foundational research and advice, guidance, and technical assistance to other NC CSC projects as they address climate science challenges that are important for land managers and ecologists in the region.

Low rainfall and record high temperatures resulted in increased tree mortality and complete forest diebacks across the West. Though land managers scrambled to respond, they lacked information needed to make informed decisions. Focusing on California\u2019s central and southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, this project seeks to determine whether a key forest management practice \u2013 forest thinning via prescribed fire \u2013 can help forests better survive drought.   Prescribed fire is commonly used in the western U.S. to remove potential wildfire fuel, such as small trees and shrubs. It is also thought that this act of selectively removing trees helps remaining trees better survive drought events, because there is less competition for water. However, this proposition has never been formally tested. This project aims to identify whether current prescribed burning practices are sufficient to help forests survive drought, or whether these practices need to be implemented more intensively to meet this goal under increasingly frequent drought.   This project will answer questions at the forefront of research needs across federal land management agencies in California. Results will (1) help National Park Service staff make planning decisions to preserve giant sequoias at Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks; (2) help fire managers at the parks identify the effectiveness of different fire treatments and whether prescribed burning should be implemented as a drought resistance strategy; and (3) inform strategic planning efforts of the U.S. Forest Service on where and how much to thin forest stands, as well as inform plans for restoring landscapes impacted by major wildfires.   Droughts are expected to become more frequent and severe in the coming decades across the Southwest.

To maintain healthy and functioning forest ecosystems, one action forest managers can take is to make management decisions that will help forests adapt to future climate change.

Information is needed that links the responses of trees to environmental change and to develop genetic profiles of resistant trees. This information could then be used in screening for adaptive genetic traits and to assess genetic diversity.  This project will help gather that information through a pilot study focusing on mountain pine beetles and whitebark pine trees in western Montana. Researchers are investigating whether the current mountain pine beetle outbreak has resulted in the selection (survival and reproduction) of drought tolerant, and consequently, beetle resistant whitebark pines.

In contrast, montane spruce-fir forests in the White and Green Mountains of New England exhibited patterns of increasing abundance, potentially due to their recovery from the negative impacts of historic land use and pollution.

Extensive portions of prairie have already been lost due to agriculture and urbanization, and as a result grassland birds have declined more than any other bird group in the last four decades. Now, climate change could exacerbate existing threats to these birds as temperatures in certain prairie ecosystems are expected to rise and extreme weather events, such as drought, could become more common.  The goal of this project was to develop a framework to identify demographic sensitivities and assess the vulnerability of grassland bird species to future climate change. To do so, the researchers developed a strong partnership among managers and researchers to understand how climate change might impact the conservation and management planning of grassland birds throughout the Northeast CASC region and identify potentially vulnerable species. Using input from managers, the team focused their efforts on two grassland indicator species of high conservation interest: Henslow\u2019s Sparrows and Bobolinks. They developed spatially-explicit and temporally dynamic species distribution models for these indicator species and evaluated the effects of past and future climate on their populations. Finally, they studied how weather and extreme events (e.g., drought and flooding) effect the breeding success of grassland birds across North America.  By incorporating information on future climate change, the project team has identified regions where Henslow's Sparrows, a species of increasing conservation concern, are likely to face unsuitable conditions for reproduction. In addition, they have identified areas that will serve as likely refugia for this species in the future. The researchers have performed the first-ever exploration of the synergistic effects of weather and grassland patch size, the most common currency of grassland bird conservation and management.

The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) is a group of islands of great conservation importance that is threatened by sea-level rise. Stretching 2,000 km beyond the main Hawaiian Islands, the NWHI are a World Heritage Site and part of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument. The islands support the largest tropical seabird rookery in the world, providing breeding habitat for 21 species of seabirds, 4 land bird species, and essential habitat for other resident and migratory wildlife. Because these are low-lying islands, even small increases in sea-level could result in the loss of critical habitat, increasing the risk of extinctions of species that are found nowhere else in the world.   The goal of this project was to provide managers with critical information on the vulnerability of the islands and the species that inhabit them to sea-level rise. Researchers used high-resolution topographic and vegetation models to predict the impacts of a range of sea-level rise scenarios on 20 islands. Results showed that a sea-level rise of +1 m would result in the loss of 4% of the total land area in the NWHI, while a rise of +2 m would result in the loss of 26% of the total land area and could leave 7 islands completely submerged. Researchers then explored the potential implications of sea-level rise for wildlife breeding habitats on each island. A loss of 4% of land area could leave more than 200,000 seabirds without nesting habitat.

In order to identify knowledge gaps and resource needs related to adaptation and resilience in coastal Alaska, the Alaska Climate Science Center partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association, and others in 2016 to hold a series of workshops in communities across coastal Alaska. These workshops brought together resource managers, tribal leaders, community planners, and scientists from tribes, state agencies, and federal agencies, with the goal of advancing coastal resilience and adaptation across the region.   Building on these workshops and previous coastal science studies, the focus is now on communicating key findings to coastal communities, and on developing actionable science strategies to address the identified needs of local communities. Researchers will also explore available tools that could support adaptation planning, such as tools for predicting coastal erosion, identifying storm surge impacts, and understanding wildlife response to a changing climate. Translating this technical information into public-friendly formats will ensure that the science on how coastal Alaska is changing can be easily used by local stakeholders to guide decision-making and adaptation planning efforts in coastal communities.

Consecutive years of drought and above average temperatures have diminished water supply and increased demand for water in this region. The increasing gap between water supply and demand is cause for concern. Climate projections for the southwestern and south central United States suggest that temperatures will continue to increase, affecting seasonal precipitation and water availability. To better manage current water supply and prepare for possible future changes, water managers need projections of future streamflow and landscape conditions that may affect future water supply.  The project researchers are currently calibrating the U.S Geological Survey\u2019s Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) to represent the natural state of the basin without managed water operations such as reservoirs or diversions. The calibrated PRMS model will be used to estimate how water flow will respond to projected future temperature and precipitation. Several model outputs, including streamflow, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture, will also be used to help provide a clear picture of how hydrologic changes affect the water resources we use for farming, municipal water supply, healthy ecological streamflow, and other uses. Also, because the future is uncertain, the project researchers will integrate multiple future climate conditions to project a range of likely future hydrologic conditions.

However, the potential effects of sea-level rise is posing new questions about the future availability of SAV for waterfowl and other coastal wildlife. Of primary concern is the fact that rising seas have the potential to increase salinities in fresh and brackish marshes on the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s coast, changing the distribution and composition of SAV communities, and affecting valuable waterfowl habitat and food resources. Not enough is known about the relationship between salinity and SAV to predict how this important food resource will respond to higher salinity levels, creating difficulties for waterfowl conservation planning.   This project identified the relationship between SAV, salinity, and other environmental variables as a first step in understanding how sea-level rise might affect food availability for waterfowl. The study examined coastal marshes of the northern Gulf of Mexico from Mobile Bay, AL, to the Nueces River, TX. Researchers compared SAV distribution and composition across a range of salinity levels, and found that water depth and salinity were the primary factors in determining the amount of SAV resources in a particular marsh. Surprisingly, researchers also found that brackish marsh tended to produce quantities of SAV waterfowl food resources similar to those in fresh marsh environments. The study also found some evidence that saline marshes contain less waterfowl food resources than brackish, intermediate, and fresh marshes.   This work will directly benefit efforts of the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, Gulf Coast Prairies Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC), and Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCC in forecasting the effects of sea-level rise on the distribution, abundance, and diversity of SAV resources and the priority fish and wildlife populations that depend upon them.

This Wildlife Adaptation Menu will be modeled off existing adaptation menus for Forestry and Urban Forestry, and it will be designed to be used in conjunction with the Adaptation Workbook. In addition to a menu of adaption strategies and approaches, the scientists will also identify site-level tactics and develop case studies demonstrating the use and implementation of the menu.

However, the potential responses of other sensitive-status birds to these changes in management have not been well evaluated.   This project will examine current and future interactions among cheatgrass density, precipitation, and fire across the Great Basin. Growth of cheatgrass is much more responsive than many native plants to variation in precipitation, especially during winter and spring. The project also will model current and future cover of sagebrush and native grasses and forbs, and explore how projected changes in fire patterns and vegetation and fire management may affect sensitive-status breeding birds. The results of this project may inform decisions about management of vegetation, fuels, and habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse.  This project is also supported by the Joint Fire Science Program.

In order to plan for this uncertain future, managers have begun to use a tool known as scenario planning, in which climate models are used to identify different plausible climate conditions, known as \u201cscenarios\u201d, for a particular area.   In a previous project, researchers with the North Central Climate Science Center worked with natural resource managers at Badlands National Park and on surrounding federal lands to model how different climate scenarios and management activities would impact the area\u2019s resources.

Building on this work, researchers will produce management-relevant publications that translate the previous project\u2019s results into a format that can support management planning.   Using insights gained from the previous project, researchers will also design a process for integrating scenario planning and climate science into National Park Service (NPS) Resource Stewardship Strategies.

Managing these ecosystems into the future requires a better understanding of how climate, hydrology, and karst ecosystems interact.  The objective of this project was to determine how species and ecosystems associated with karst might respond to future temperature and precipitation extremes and accompanying changes in groundwater levels and springflow. The research focused on 16 species in the Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas and eight species in the Madison aquifer in western South Dakota. Researchers linked global climate models, regional climate models, and hydrologic models to determine how future springflow might be impacted by changes in temperature and precipitation. By combining information about future hydrology with what we know about species needs, researchers determined the vulnerability of the selected species to climate extremes.  Researchers found that more species in the Edwards aquifer are vulnerable to climate extremes than in the Madison aquifer, due in part to the more severe hydrologic changes that the Edwards aquifer is expected to undergo. This result suggests that including hydrologic factors critical to species health is essential in evaluating the vulnerability of karst ecosystems to climate extremes.

Yet the Colorado River\u2019s water supply is already fully allocated, meaning that the economic and environmental health of the region is closely tied to the river\u2019s streamflow.   Climate projections for the Southwest show a future marked by chronic drought and substantial reductions in streamflow. The region has already been impacted by climate change, experiencing warmer temperatures and more intense drought, particularly in late spring and early summer, resulting in reduced streamflow. In order to appropriately manage the Colorado River under changing conditions, water resource planners require reliable projections of future streamflow.   This project seeks to characterize how changing climate conditions affect cool and warm season precipitation in the Colorado River basin and the corresponding impacts on streamflow. Specifically, researchers will examine whether human-caused climate change interacts with natural variations in climate (such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation) intensify climate extremes, such as severe drought. Researchers will implement a new technique to downscale global climate model data, to produce more accurate streamflow projections that can be used to make local- and regional-scale water management decisions.

Aspen woodlands also provide high quality forage for livestock and draw tourists to the region to view the golden vistas that form in the fall.   However, aspen is currently declining across large portions of the West and it\u2019s estimated that approximately 40% of western aspen will be without suitable climate conditions within 50 years. In the northern and central Rocky Mountains, it\u2019s thought that reduced soil moisture and changing fire patterns in particular could affect the trees. Yet understanding the future of aspen in the region is currently challenged by a lack of information on how changes in fire and soil moisture interact to impact aspen growth, survival, and distribution. For example, in some places aspen may thrive following fire if soil moisture is adequate, while they may decline in areas where soil moisture is too low.  The goal of this work is to project the likely effects of altered moisture and fire regimes on aspen under climate change. Based on the results, researchers will develop maps of future aspen distribution in the northern and central Rocky Mountains and identify areas that could be suitable for aspen restoration. Additionally, researchers will project how climate change and aspen mortality might alter streamflow in watersheds that have large amounts of snow redistribution, in order to help small-scale irrigators adapt to future conditions. The results of this project will help land managers prioritize areas for aspen protection and restoration and proactively plan for the effects of climate change on this important species.

These data were used to calibrate the one-dimensional Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model. These data and the SHAW calibration have previously been described in multiple publications, particularly Chauvin et al 2011 and Flerchinger et al 2016. In the dataset presented here, climate scenarios have been constructed, applied to the historic record, simulated in the SHAW model, and hydrologic results have been analyzed. These data include the following: (1) uscData. These are the historical data described above, prepared for input into the SHAW model with three hydrologic response units (HRU), labeled \u201caspen\u201d, \u201chighsage\u201d, and \u201clowsage.\u201d (2) synthetic_data: These directories contain synthetic data representing climate scenarios, with corresponding names. Climate scenarios were constructed in the script, \u201cclimate_analyze.R.\u201d Climate scenarios input to this script were obtained from the Integrated Scenarios project: http://climate.nkn.uidaho.edu/IntegratedScenarios/. Historic (1950-2005) and future (2050-2099, RCP 8.5) climate projections were obtained for the grid cell containing Upper Sheep Creek. Seasonally variable daily mean changes in temperature and precipitation were derived by comparing historical and future data; these were stored as \u201cdelta functions\u201d (in delta.csv). For each seasonally variable scenario, the effective mean annual change in precipitation or temperature was calculated, and this was applied in the same amount for each day of the water year. The naming convention is as follows: txpydz, where \u201cx\u201d is the temperature deviation from the delta function identified by comparing historical data with 2050-2099 RCP8.5. \u201cy\u201d is the precipitation deviation from the original delta function. X or y values equal to NA indicate that the precipitation or temperature was not changed. \u201cz\u201d indicates whether the simulation is seasonally constant (z = 1) or variable (z = 0). An empirically-derived drift function was applied to each of these scenarios in order to determine effective precipitation after snow drifting (Chauvin et al 2011). (3) model_runs: This directory contains all the files necessary to run the SHAW model. For more information on the SHAW model inputs and outputs, see ShawUsers.30.docx, or ftp site: ftp://ftp.nwrc.ars.usda.gov/public/ShawModel/. In these scenarios, the .exe files named for each HRU contain the names of the .inp files. Providing these .exe files as an input to SHAW allows for SHAW to be run automatically from an R script. The script, \u201crun_shaw_windows.R\u201d contains the code needed to run SHAW. To use this code, we recommend reading the script and changing the directory paths at the beginning of it to suit your needs. This script takes several hours to run on a laptop computer, particularly for the aspen HRU (~10 minutes per scenario on MacbookPro 2015 with 2.7GHz Intel Core i5 and 8GB RAM running Windows in Parallels). (4) model_output: These folders contain the outputs of the SHAW model after runs with the scenarios as described above. Within each HRU directory, each folder is named for one scenario, and contains the output files corresponding to that scenario. The output files are named only after the type of file (e.g., water.out). For that reason, the directory structure provided here is critical to the interpretability of these data. This folder also contains a hydrologic response unit not included in \u201csynthetic_data.\u201d In the \u201cas\u201d folder, aspen HRU site characteristics, including weather, have been used, but aspen have been replaced with grasses to simulate the effects of aspen mortality. (5) Tabular_results: This folder contains .csv files that summarize the data contained in the model_output folder over different time periods and for different analysis objectives. Each of these .csv files is created within the workflow described in the R script, \u201crun_shaw.R\u201d. (6) R: This folder contains scripts used to run the analyses for this project. The script \u201crun_shaw.R\u201d is a heavily commented script that functions as a recipe for the entire analysis; going through the directions in run_shaw.R should enable you to reproduce the analysis in this project. These data were used to assess the hydrologic sensitivity of Upper Sheep Creek to changing climate and to aspen mortality. They could be used to reproduce our analysis, assess hydrologic impacts aside from those assessed in the scripts included here, or as a template for building more climate (or other) scenarios.",

globe\u2014even in areas with cooler climates. Mitigating the negative effects of climate change, in particular increased drought frequency and severity, poses a major challenge to forest managers. Managers are searching for strategies that minimize the negative effects of drought on forests (i.e. increase their resistance to drought) and maximize the ability of forests to recover after a drought (i.e. improve their resilience). Evidence suggests that forests with certain combinations of tree species, sizes, and stem densities are better able to withstand and recover from drought.   The goal of this study is to identify which forest management practices best minimize drought impacts for a range of forest types and climates in the U.S. Researchers are using eight long-term forest management experiments that are already underway across the country to identify how different forest management practices can increase the resistance and resilience of forests to drought. Practices such as forest thinning, a technique in which certain trees are selectively removed to make room for others, have been shown to help reduce the stress experienced by the remaining trees during drought and to increase recovery rates following drought.   Taking action to protect forests from drought will have far-reaching implications, ranging from sustaining wildlife that rely on forests for habitat, to retaining the carbon storage capacity of forests, to maintaining the ability of forests to regulate water flow and soil quality. The findings of this work will directly inform the natural resource management community as to which management practices will best safeguard forests in the face of a changing climate and increasing drought.

However, to date, limited data and the uncertain effects of climate change have hindered predictions of future streamflow.  Through this project, scientists developed a model that provides a way to estimate future stream low flow (streamflow during a period of prolonged dryness) by categorizing streams based on their physical characteristics.

Researchers used the model to forecast flow changes in Maui streams under two possible end-of-century future climate scenarios. Results indicate that in areas where rainfall is projected to decrease in the future, stream low flow may decrease by more than 50 percent in some areas, and habitat for native species may decrease by more than 25 percent in some streams.

Salmonids also have strong societal values and contribute enormously to regional economies and Native American cultures. Today, many native salmonid populations are small, highly fragmented, and isolated from genetic exchange, thereby increasing their vulnerability to disturbances due to their limited ability to adapt through migration.  Rising global air temperatures are altering the characteristics of aquatic ecosystems worldwide, including freshwater in the United States. Understanding the vulnerability of aquatic species and habitats to changing conditions is critical for conservation and management of these important natural resources. However, no studies have used existing data to understand the relationships between climate and the survival of salmonid populations to more accurately assess and predict climate effects on freshwater fish species across the entire United States.  This project aims to use existing fish population and climate data from the recent past (1950 \u2013 current) to understand the responses of fish to climate impacts on streams. The project team will focus on these main questions: 1) how have stream temperatures and flows been changing over the last 60 years and how do these changes vary across the United States?, 2) how have trout populations responded to these changes?, 3) have invasive species, land use change, and other stressors exacerbated the effects of climate on native trout populations?, and 4) how useful are current management and conservation tools when applied to historical data?

Understanding how climate change will affect these ecosystems is vital for knowing how best to protect them and the services they supply.  The goal of this project was to assess the climate change vulnerability of 12 key ecosystems in the southeastern U.S. and Caribbean, ranging from Caribbean coastal mangrove to Nashville Basin limestone glade and woodland. Scientists used the existing scientific literature and geospatial analysis to determine each ecosystem\u2019s sensitivity to changes in climate, its exposure level to those changes, and its capacity to adapt. Together, this information was compiled into a qualitative vulnerability ranking for each ecosystem. For two of the 12 ecosystems, scientists additionally assessed vulnerability using NatureServe\u2019s Habitat Climate Change Vulnerability Index framework.  Of the 12 ecosystems examined, five were rated as having high vulnerability to climate change, six had moderate vulnerability, and one had low vulnerability. For the two ecosystems assessed with multiple approaches, these rankings generally agreed. Researchers additionally identified critical management actions for reducing threats to and promoting adaptation of these ecosystems. Collectively, the results of this project will help regional decision-makers plan and prioritize their conservation and monitoring efforts.

Thus, the future distribution and composition of sagebrush landscapes is likely to differ greatly from today\u2019s configuration. We conducted a large, multi-objective project to identify: (1) characteristics of habitats required by sage-grouse, (2) spatial organization of breeding populations of sage-grouse across their entire range, (3) current and future distribution of sagebrush landscapes, and (4) connectivity of habitat and sage-grouse populations. Ultimately, the project will provide an understanding of sage-grouse response to spatial and temporal changes in their environment. This information will permit managers to estimate population vulnerability to stochastic or environmental risks and will aid decisions about allocating limited resources for conservation.   Spatial organization of breeding populations (Objective 2) can best be delineated from genetic data.

Recent changes in climate have caused winter flooding and warmer summer water temperatures in the region, reducing the cold-water habitats that bull trout depend on. The southernmost bull trout populations, found in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada, are currently restricted to small reserves where the coldest waters still exist. These shrinking habitats have created a severed environment being further split by dams, poor water quality, and invasive species.  The goal of this project was to determine how these factors threaten the species regionally by using predictions of stream temperature to map habitat areas that support juvenile bull trout. Results show that maintaining larger areas of cold water habitat had the greatest, positive impact on bull trout habitat conservation. Other conditions that support bull trout include very cold summer water temperatures, fewer winter floods, and fewer human disturbances (such as the building of dams). Based on these results, specific climate adaptation actions that local managers might consider include prioritizing land and water use to foster colder summer water temperatures, controlling invasive species, increasing connectivity between Bull Trout habitats, and continuing monitoring efforts.  To ensure that these results and habitat maps could be incorporated into management actions, researchers met with stakeholders including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the U.S. Forest Service, and the Burns Paiute Tribe.  As a result, the maps were used in forest planning for the Lolo National Forest in Montana, the Wenatchee River basin, and in the lower Pend Oreille River during the relicensing process for local dam operations. In addition, the recovery plan proposed by the USFWS incorporated these models into detailed analyses of bull trout habitat loss, which managers can use to prioritize actions in their Recovery Unit Implementation Plans.

We used predictions of temperatures in streams across approximately two-thirds of the species' range in the U.S. to map coldwater streams or \u201cpatches\u201d suitable for spawning and early rearing of Bull Trout. Each patch consists of streams with contiguous reaches of cold water. Patches were delineated using medium resolution National Hydrography Dataset streams containing modeled temperatures available at 1 km intervals, as provided by the NorWeST project (http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST.html).Once the patches were delineated, various watershed metrics were generated for each patch to provide covariates for occupancy models that were used to estimate the probability of presence of Bull Trout. Watershed metrics included climatic and/or local factors hypothesized to influence Bull Trout, such as patch size, connectivity to other patches, migratory habitat size, brook trout presence, lake trout presence, human influence, road density, prevalence of very cold water, winter high flow events, and wildfire. Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) is one of the most cold-adapted species in freshwater in North America. The species is listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act throughout its range within the conterminous United States, which encompasses a vast geography, including major river systems such as the Klamath and Columbia Rivers, and a host of Pacific coastal rivers in Washington State, as well as river systems originating east of the continental divide in northern Montana and ultimately draining to the Atlantic Ocean.Our fundamental objective in this project is to evaluate climate-related and local threats to Bull Trout and to provide an objective and unified framework for evaluating them together across the species\u2019 range within the conterminous United States. To this end, we have 1) developed and applied methods for delineating and mapping discrete patches of habitat that support spawning and early rearing of Bull Trout, 2) attributed these patches with covariates indicating climate-related and local threats to Bull Trout, and 3) developed models to relate these covariates to presence of Bull Trout to identify the most important factors influencing presence, and to quantify spatial variation in their influences.

Unfortunately, climate change may be putting the species at further risk. Sea-level rise, increased storm frequency, and changes in temperature and humidity could reduce the suitability of habitat used by loggerheads and other endangered sea turtles for nesting and feeding.   This project assessed the vulnerability of key sea turtle nesting beaches to climate change in the Southeast. Researchers examined previous records of sea turtle nesting locations in the Southeast to identify the characteristics of these beaches, then predicted the future suitability of these beaches for nesting based on projected climate change. Beaches on both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are expected to be very susceptible to change associated with sea-level rise, making it imperitive that we understand how these changes will affect the suitability of nesting sites.   The results of this work can be used to directly inform federal recovery efforts for the loggerhead sea turtle. Identifying locations where beach habitat will no longer be suitable for nesting will help managers determine what action needs to be taken to protect loggerheads, such as moving nests out of highly vulnerable areas.

The ability of species to adapt to the impacts of climate change (i.e., their adaptive capacity) is an important factor to consider when assessing vulnerability. For example, organisms can possess traits that allow them to move to areas of favorable habitat or change their phenotypes (observable characteristics) in response to changing environmental conditions. Additionally, an organism\u2019s traits can adapt to a changing external environment over multiple generations through evolutionary processes.  Recent scientific evidence suggests that \u201cevolutionary adaptive capacity\u201d (the ability to adapt to changing environments via evolutionary processes; EVAC) can actually occur over shorter time periods than originally thought and the tools to measure and predict evolutionary changes are becoming increasingly available. However, accounting for EVAC in climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning is uncommon and resource managers often make decisions without considering the potential evolution of species.  The purpose of this project is to help bridge the gap between science and management communities by highlighting examples of EVAC that have resulted from changing climate conditions and providing insights on how relevant scientific information can be used in policy and planning activities. This work will foster a two-way communication between scientists and managers that focuses equally on what scientists can learn from managers and what managers can learn from scientists, increasing the likelihood of knowledge and science use by the decision-making community. The specific objectives are to 1) illustrate the importance of EVAC and its interaction with other forms of adaptive capacity for understanding vulnerability of wildlife, 2) identify common barriers that managers encounter with regards to assessing and making decisions related to EVAC, 3) provide knowledge that could serve as a solution for overcoming these barriers, and 4) identify knowledge gaps where future research is needed to inform key management questions.

This process is recognized as one of the most pressing conservation issues in the Southeastern U.S. Habitat loss and fragmentation reduces the amount of suitable habitat available to wildlife species, divides wildlife populations and reduces genetic diversity, and interrupts important migration patterns; and climate change is likely to disrupt habitat areas even more. Maintaining connectivity between habitats and wildlife populations will be a key management strategy for conserving biodiversity in the region into the future.  Previous work by the research team modeled and mapped connectivity in the Southeast for three animals that inhabit bottomland forests, and showed where key connections in the landscape lie both currently and in the future. However, the researchers observed large variation in connectivity across geographical areas, time periods, and species. These results raised new questions about which connections are most important for management actions.  This project is building on this previous research with four approaches: 1) analyze consistency between this work and other connectivity efforts; 2) asses trade-offs between current and future connectivity; 3) extend work on the prioritization of core habitat areas and central points of connectivity; and 4) optimize the selection of sites for conservation action at the local scale.

This population is expected to increase by 8 percent from 2010 to 2020.

Therefore, sea-level rise and the associated changes in coastlines challenge both human communities and ecosystems.  Understanding which coastal lands will be vulnerable to sea-level rise is critical for policy makers, land-use planners, and coastal residents. Focusing on the coastal region from Virginia to Maine, researchers examined a range of different possible sea-level rise scenarios, combined with information on features of the coastal landscape (such as elevation and land cover type), to forecast which coastal areas would likely flood, and which would likely change or move as a result of sea-level rise. Researchers found that 70 percent of the Northeast U.S. Atlantic Coast has the capacity to change over the next several decades in response to rising seas.  Knowing where coastal habitats are likely to be resilient, where they will likely change, and where they might flood as a result of sea-level rise is essential for developing management and resource allocation strategies that preserve coastal areas.

The purpose of this project is to develop a spatially explicit, probabilistic model of coastal response for the Northeastern U.S. to a variety of sea-level scenarios that take into account the variable nature of the coast and provides outputs at spatial and temporal scales suitable for decision support. Model results provide predictions of adjusted land elevation ranges (AE) with respect to forecast sea-levels, a likelihood estimate of this outcome (PAE), and a probability of coastal response (CR) characterized as either static or dynamic. The predictions span the coastal zone vertically from -12 meters (m) to 10 m above mean high water (MHW). Results are produced at a horizontal resolution of 30 meters for four decades (the 2020s, 2030s, 2050s and 2080s). Adjusted elevations and their respective probabilities are generated using regional geospatial datasets of current sea-level forecasts, vertical land movement rates, and current elevation data. Coastal response type predictions incorporate adjusted elevation predictions with land cover data and expert knowledge to determine the likelihood that an area will be able to accommodate or adapt to water level increases and maintain its initial land class state or transition to a new non-submerged state (dynamic) or become submerged (static). Intended users of these data include scientific researchers, coastal planners, and natural resource management communities. These GIS layers provide a forecast of the adjusted land elevation (AE) with respect to predicted sea-level rise for the Northeastern U.S. for the 2020s, 2030s, 2050s and 2080s.

The output displays the most likely of one of five adjusted elevation ranges (-12 to -1, -1 to 0, 0 to 1, 1 to 5, and 5 to 10 m) to be observed for the forecast year as defined by a probabilistic framework (a Bayesian network), and should be used concurrently with the likelihood layer (PAE), also available from http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/coastal_response/, which provides users with an estimation of the forecast elevation range occurring when compared with the four other elevation ranges.

Model results provide predictions of adjusted land elevation ranges (AE) with respect to forecast sea-levels, a likelihood estimate of this outcome (PAE), and a probability of coastal response (CR) characterized as either static or dynamic.

Adjusted elevations and their respective probabilities are generated using regional geospatial datasets of current sea-level forecasts, vertical land movement rates, and current elevation data. Coastal response type predictions incorporate adjusted elevation predictions with land cover data and expert knowledge to determine the likelihood that an area will be able to accommodate or adapt to water level increases and maintain its initial land class state or transition to a new non-submerged state (dynamic) or become submerged (static).

However, climate change driven sea-level rise is causing many beaches to disappear, endangering property, infrastructure, and critical habitats.

Researchers focused on the island of Kaua\u02bbi, modeling beach response to rising sea level over the next century and producing maps that  provide information about which areas of coastline are especially vulnerable to future erosion as a result of sea-level rise. Results show that coastal erosion is expected to significantly increase on Kaua\u02bbi, doubling its historic rate by 2050 and leading to partial or total loss of 90 percent of beaches by 2100.  The Hawai\u02bbi Department of Land and Natural Resources, local planning departments, and other coastal management agencies are using this project\u2019s data and maps for hazard preparedness and adaptation planning on state and local scales.

Native Americans have a deep connection to the natural environment within which their livelihoods, cultural identity, and spiritual practices are rooted. Changes to water flow and hydrology, landscapes, and ecosystems, in combination with socio-economic and other factors, amplify tribal vulnerabilities to climate change. In the Southwest, tribes are already experiencing a range of impacts that are at least partially related to climate change. They include serious water quality and supply issues in the context of prolonged drought; reduced ability to grow or collect important traditional crops and raw materials; loss of forest resources from large and landscape-transforming wildfires exacerbated by drought, aridity, and insect infestations; and health impacts from heat waves, dust storms, and smoke from wildfires.  The Southwest Climate Science Center is partnering with the University of Arizona Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions (CCASS) to leverage previously existing and newly developing tribal engagement capacity within CCASS and to help identify emergent opportunities to support tribes in adapting to climate change. Through this project, CCASS is conducting a preliminary assessment of tribal interest and capacity for adaptation across the Southwest via interviews with selected tribal leaders and resource managers. In November 2015, CCASS also partnered with the Desert Landscape Conservation Cooperative to hold a meeting with tribal members that focused on successful tribal climate adaptation plans, lessons learned, traditional ecological knowledge, and tribal adaptation activities across the U.S. The CCASS project team is also developing a set of products to help tribes use \u201cscenario planning\u201d in their climate adaptation plans, allowing the tribes to consider different possible future scenarios in a changing climate.

Within Missouri, there are more than 85,000 acres of public conservation lands in large-river floodplains. Floodplain lands are highly dynamic and challenging to manage, particularly climatic conditions change. These lands have the potential to provide valuable ecosystem services, like wildlife habitat, nutrient processing, carbon sequestration, and flood-water storage, that produce economic values in terms of recreational spending, improved water quality, and decreased flood hazards. However, floodplain managers may need tools to help them understand changing conditions on conservation lands.  This project worked with floodplain managers to identify the information most needed to understand nonstationary conditions, and to develop tools they can apply to conservation lands to improve decision making. Through an online survey and workshop with managers, the researchers found that time, funding, and a perceived disconnect between research and management limited the ability of managers to use new scientific information. However, managers revealed that they were willing to partner with scientists to identify science needs and products useful for management decisions.  Floodplain managers agreed that metrics of water inundation, including depth, extent, frequency, duration, and seasonality are the most useful metrics to inform management of floodplain conservation lands. The research team used scientific models of flood inundation under different climate scenarios to examine these metrics for the lower 500 miles of the Missouri River to aid in current and future management decisions of conservation properties. They found that annually, climate change is estimated to increase the duration, frequency, depth, and extent of flooding.

A recent survey of 80 managers of floodplain conservation lands along the Upper and Middle Mississippi and Lower Missouri Rivers in the central United States found that the most critical information needed to improve floodplain management centered on metrics for characterizing depth, extent, frequency, duration, and timing of inundation. These metrics can be delivered to managers efficiently through cloud-based interactive maps. To calculate these metrics, we interpolated an existing one-dimensional HEC-RAS hydraulic model for the Lower Missouri River, which simulated water surface elevations at cross sections spaced (&lt;1 kilometer) to sufficiently characterize water surface profiles along an approximately 800 kilometer stretch upstream from the confluence with the Mississippi River over an 80-year record at a daily time step. To translate these water surface elevations to inundation depths, we subtracted a merged terrain model consisting of floodplain LIDAR and bathymetric surveys of the river channel. We completed these calculations for an 800 kilometer stretch of the Missouri River, spanning from Rulo, Nebraska to the river's confluence with the Mississippi River. This approach resulted in a 29,000+ day time series of inundation depths across the floodplain using grid cells with 30 meter spatial resolution. This dataset presents 17 metrics for each of two scenarios, one using a baseline timeseries of stages from the HEC-RAS simulation and one using a timeseries of stages adjusted to account for changes in discharge under one possible climate change scenario. These metrics are calculated on a per pixel basis and encompass a variety of temporal criteria generally relevant to flora and fauna of interest to floodplain managers, including, for example, the average number of days inundated per year within a growing season. We also include a series of maps of water depths across the floodplain by return interval for each scenario, and the minimum return interval at which each pixel is inundated. Lastly, we include the base elevation layer that we generated to calculate depth of inundation from interpolated water-surface elevations. This dataset was developed to quantify timing, extent, depth, and duration of inundation for floodplains on the Missouri River, and to assess relative potential for ecological restoration with a variety of biological endpoints. We developed a suite of metrics which characterize inundation timing and extent that will be useful to floodplain managers in for planning restoration efforts.

The Laurentian Great Lakes in North America are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world, and they have experienced major changes due to fluctuations in pollution and nutrient loadings, exploitation of natural resources, introductions of non-native species, and shifting climatic patterns.  In this project, we analyzed established long-term data about important fish populations from across the Great Lakes basin, including from Oneida Lake in NY, Lake Michigan, and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Our objective was to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in fish catches from large freshwater lakes that have experienced large-scale changing conditions.  We evaluated analytical approaches with the potential to disentangle sources of variability in standardized monitoring data.  Specifically, we considered 1) how the decomposition of spatial and temporal variation in fish catches can be used to measure a response to perturbation; 2) how truncation of population age structure can alter population oscillations which may shift how a population is affected by environmental fluctuations; and 3) how the composition of a fish community may respond to a suite of environmental drivers through time. Using long-term gill-net data for walleye, we found that average catch and variance structure differed before and after large-scale perturbations.

Factors such as low heat energy, short growing seasons, and cold winters prevent the survival of many crops. While considerable research has gone into assessing how to overcome some of these limitations, results suggest that climate change is already altering the equation, and will likely continue to do so. Some research suggests crop production for some varieties might advance northward in the state, leading to increases in yields and new varieties becoming viable. However, it\u2019s also projected that water stress may become an increasing challenge facing farmers. Further, some crops, such as the burgeoning peony market, are dependent on Alaska\u2019s cool climate and late summer season, and could be negatively impacted by warming temperatures.   Currently available tools are limited in their ability to help Alaska\u2019s farmers adjust to climate change, because they primarily focus on the effects of extreme winter temperatures. However, additional variables, such as day length, thaw dates, freeze dates, growing season length, and occurrence of extreme heat may all affect whether a particular crop can be grown in a particular location. To better support Alaska\u2019s small-scale growers, researchers will work with local farmers to first identify their immediate and long-term needs in relation to ongoing and potential future climate-related changes to crops. Next, researchers will develop fine-scale maps, tools, and datasets that meet these stakeholder-defined needs.

Commercial peony farming has experienced considerable growth in recent years, and it\u2019s estimated that in 2017 growers grossed between $900,000 and $1.8 million in sales. Further, as a perennial, peonies are potentially affected by changes in weather that occur throughout the year.   Alaska\u2019s high-latitude setting places it at the front lines of environmental change.

However, due to differences in topography and coastal urbanization extent, estuaries vary in their ability to accommodate wetland migration. The landward movement of wetlands requires suitable conditions, such as a gradual slope and land free of urban development. Urban barriers can constrain migration and result in wetland loss (coastal squeeze). For future-focused conservation planning purposes, there is a pressing need to quantify and compare the potential for wetland landward movement and coastal squeeze. For 41 estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico (i.e., the USA gulf coast), we quantified and compared the area available for the landward migration of tidal saline wetlands and the area where urban development is expected to prevent migration (coastal squeeze), under three alternative future sea-level rise scenarios (0.5-, 1.0-, and 1.5-m by 2100). This effort builds on work by Enwright and others (2015, 2016) which modeled future tidal saline wetland landward migration at the region scale (i.e., all five Gulf coast states). However, there is much potential to use these data for customized analyses focused on landscape conservation design within specific estuaries. The objective of this analysis was to identify differences across estuaries in future landward tidal saline wetland migration opportunities and urban barriers to migration. In broad terms, we provide scientific information that could be used by natural resource managers to enhance the adaptive capacity of coastal wetlands in the face of sea-level rise and coastal development.

Glacier melt plays a crucial role in the movement of nutrients through a landscape and into the ocean, and the flow of water into streams that sustain many species. As air temperatures rise, increased rates of glacier melt may have significant impacts to the hydrology and ecology in these areas.  This project aims to broaden our understanding of the role of glaciers in the hydrology of Alaska and Washington state and incorporate this knowledge into two types of models that simulate past and future scenarios of water flow. The project team aims to develop a public web portal to allow users to explore content, access data, and view results of the modeling through maps and visualizations. The team also plans to assess potential hazards (such as flooding) and habitat concerns (such as impacts to fish breeding habitats) that are possible with increased glacier melt and changes in streamflow. Land and natural resource managers can use this information to assess risks and plan for future conditions that may impact local and regional communities.

The four types of comparisons (with corresponding filenames indicated in parentheses) include: 1) annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. total annual winter precipitation (AR_WinterPrecip), 2) annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. annual maximum NDVI (AR_NDVI), 3) spatially-averaged annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. area burned by wildfire during the same year by Level IV ecoregion (AR_Fire_SameYear), and 4) spatially-averaged annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. area burned by wildfire with a 1-year lag by Level IV ecoregion (AR_Fire_OneYearLag). The eight landfall latitudes are indicated in filenames as follows: 25N, 27_5N, 30N, 32_5N, 35N, 37_5_N, 40N, 42_5N. Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are a major mechanism for water vapor transport from the tropics to mid-latitudes that strongly influence precipitation in western North America and elsewhere in the world. This study assesses historical relations between landfalling ARs and interannual variations in vegetation biomass production and associated fuels accumulation in the Southwest. The relations identified are stratified in terms of AR landfall latitude, the influence of topographic barriers, and across ecosystem types.

Historically, a large buffer of ice along the shoreline has protected this region from some of the more severe effects of coastal storms. However, climate change may not only increase the frequency and intensity of storms, but also cause a loss of shoreline ice, possibly increasing the incidence of coastal erosion and flooding and introducing saltwater to freshwater environments. These hazards have the potential to substantially disrupt the environment and commerce in the region, but more information is needed to determine the likely impacts.   To fill this gap, researchers sought to better understand how coastal processes will be affected by climate change. Specifically, they modeled the relationship between shoreline ice, storm surge, and coastal flooding along the western Alaska coast. The model will be subsequently evaluated for its usefulness to entities such as the National Weather Service (for better forecast capabilities) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and local communities (for better design and emergency management services).

For example, the impacts of a 2002 drought are estimated to have resulted in a $3 billion loss to the agricultural sector in Nebraska and South Dakota. Meanwhile, the ecological impacts of drought in the region have included increased tree mortality, surges in the outbreak of pests, and intensifying forest fires.   Located within this region is the Missouri River Basin, an important agricultural production area home to approximately 12 million people, including 28 Native American tribes. Tribal governments and multiple federal agencies manage land and natural resources in the drought-impacted Basin. The goal of this project is to understand how federal and tribal natural resource managers experience and deal with drought in this landscape. Researchers will document how managers perceive drought impacts, how their decisions are affected by these perceptions, and their capacity to respond to and prepare for drought.   This information will enable researchers to determine the types of climate data and tools that will help managers operating under drought conditions. Locally-specific \u201cdrought stories\u201d will be developed, detailing historic trends and future projections of drought, as well as the risk perceptions, decisions, and adaptive capacities of local managers. Understanding the different perceptions and impacts of drought felt by managers will help provide a foundation for fostering more collective resource management across the region in the face of future drought.

We conducted in-depth interviews (n=41) with DOI and tribal land managers in three case sites across the north central United States (northwest Colorado, southwest South Dakota, and Wind River Reservation), the goal of which was to develop a better understanding of drought vulnerabilities, risks, and responses in high-risk, multi-jurisdictional landscapes across the Missouri River Basin. DRAI posed the following research questions: 1. How do different resource managers from the Department of Interior (DOI), other federal agencies, and tribal communities perceive and characterize drought risk for the lands they manage? 2. How are their respective grassland/rangeland, fish and wildlife, and forest management decisions affected by those drought risk perceptions? 3. What indicators (e.g., climate science, local knowledge) are used to document and understand drought conditions and progression? 4. What are the impacts of drought to key management targets and livelihoods? 5. What are their differential capacities (and barriers) for responding to and preparing for drought risks? Data was analyzed using a grounded-theory approach, where risk perceptions, responses, and capacities to respond are derived from the stakeholders themselves. The database includes 41 in-depth interview transcripts with DOI (USFWS, BLM, NPS, BIA) land/resource managers, state and district water administrators, and tribal land and resource managers from 3 case sites. A range of expertise was represented in these interviews and included water resource managers/engineers, ecologists, wildlife biologists, fire coordinators, rangeland management specialists, among others. Each transcript has been coded, analyzed, and compared across cases and management situations in the context of the 5 overarching questions, as well as in the context of the inter-related climate drivers, ecological impacts, and adaptation/responses in the context of drought and climate change. The database includes 300+ social, climate, and ecological codes that describe the social-ecological context of drought and drought management in each respective case.

In addition, American Samoa is projected to become wetter overall, with a mean rainfall increase of up to 25 percent by the late 21st century, and Guam may be subject to a higher frequency of strong tropical cyclones.

Global change is leading to major shifts in the abundance, distribution, and life history of these species, with concomitant effects on their value to the peoples for whom they are most culturally important. While a number of studies have begun to explore the futures of culturally significant species, these studies typically do so in isolation, focusing on individual plant species and single future scenarios, and involve little engagement with the people for whom such species are most important.  This project seeks to fill this gap by examining the future of culturally important species as climate conditions change, through close engagement with Indigenous stakeholders. Using an approach known as climate-analogue mapping, researchers will examine regions that are currently experiencing the specific climate conditions that are expected to be experienced by tribal lands in the future, as a means of forecasting potential future climate conditions for tribal lands.

These extremes can affect the availability of food and water needed by wildlife. Wildlife management agencies and conservation organizations need information on resource availability for wildlife under future climate scenarios to design effective management strategies to sustain wildlife populations.   Project scientists are working with the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and other partners to understand the effects of changing resource availability on four grassland species: American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), Gunnison\u2019s prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni), Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamat), and Gambel\u2019s Quail (Callipepla gambelii).

However, this semi-arid landscape presents challenges for management due to highly variable patterns in growing conditions leading to differences in plant composition, fuel accumulation and vegetation recovery. Much of this variability is created by soil and climate conditions. Recent work by multiple agencies and scientists defined relationships between soil and climate that characterize ecosystem recovery and resistance to degradation. These relations have important implications for management treatment outcomes, fuel profiles and fire risk, post-fire recovery and noxious weed invasions. Modern data and modeling applications focused on the soil environment can improve our ability to map variations in growing conditions. Instead of broadly classified climate regions, we model a continuous surface of grid cells using the soil and climate conditions unique to each location. The result is a spatially explicit simulation of evapotranspiration rates and soil moisture budgets across a large and variable landscape. This allows classification of each location according to traditional taxonomy and refined recognition of important variability of the soil-climate within those classes. Importantly, because this approach uses climate inputs, it can be informed by climate model scenarios to assess implications for habitat conditions, restoration outcomes and fuel profiles.

Climate change is expected to affect migratory bird habitat and populations in multiple ways, and a mechanistic understanding of how demographic rates are related to climate variables will help land and resource managers to better anticipate and manage these changes.

Data collected through MAPS is used to clarify the factors driving population declines; to determine priority areas to target for conservation and restoration; and to clarify relationships between demographic trends and environmental factors. IBP is also collaborating with researchers from the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center to develop a climate-informed integrated population model by combining MAPS data with additional data sources on climate variables, population trends, and occupancy data. This model will provide a clearer understanding of the factors that impact migratory bird populations and the ways that climate change is likely to affect species survival by clarifying relationships between climate variables and demographic parameters.

In recognition of this challenge, regional drought early warning systems (DEWS) and related drought-information tools have been developed under the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS). Despite the existence of many tools and information sources, however, the factors that influence if a tool(s) is (are) used, which tools are used, and how much benefit those tools provide remain poorly understood. Using the Upper Colorado River DEWS as a case study, this study investigated how water, land, and fire managers select from among many available tools.  The Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) was one of the first pilot areas, beginning in 2009, for implementation of a regional drought early warning system (DEWS) under the NIDIS program, which now supports eight regional DEWS. (In 2016, the UCRB DEWS was expanded and reconfigured into the Intermountain West DEWS). The selection of the UCRB for a pilot DEWS reflects the regional importance of drought monitoring for managing water supply for agriculture and other uses, and the need for effective decision support related to drought. New drought-information tools were developed specifically for the UCRB DEWS, and a number of others have been created since 2009, adding to the pre-existing toolkit for drought decision making. The various tools that are now available in the Upper Colorado River Basin region can be expected to be more or less suitable for different decision makers\u2019 needs. As a result, the broad decision context of this case study (managing drought) was fixed, but the information needs of users varied. This provided the opportunity to examine the varied choices decision makers make about which of the available tools to use or not use.  The research identified four broad categories of tool use that map to particular decision contexts. Water supply managers, land managers with rangeland management responsibilities, land managers focused on ecological health, and fire managers each use a suite of indicators and tools that match their particular decision context and timeframe at which they make decisions. Important differences also emerged in how respondents find out about tools, with water managers reporting strong inter-agency connections while land managers tend to rely on information from others within their agencies. Fire managers also play a key role in keeping others in the land management agencies informed about drought.

Meanwhile, in Denali, cold May temperatures delayed openings for some tourist-related businesses.   Previous work has identified which atmospheric circulation patterns are associated with extreme events, information which can help refine forecasts and downscale future climate projections. The goal of this project is to test whether these patterns hold true for all days that experience extreme weather. So far, researchers have found that not all extreme days are created equal. Some extreme climate events, such as very warm summer days, routinely occur under the expected atmospheric circulation patterns, and those circulation patterns are almost always associated with extreme climate events.

This project examined the effect of shifting climate conditions on 20 species of conservation concern in the South Central United States.

Researchers examined where these species currently occur in order to better understand the environmental, especially climate, conditions necessary for their survival. Climate and land use change projections for 2050 and 2070 were used to assess the potential future distributions of conditions suitable for these species.  Maps evaluating patterns of loss of suitable conditions for the species were developed and incorporated into the publicly accessible New Mexico state-level CHAT (Crucial Habitat Assessment Tool). CHATs are being used by states across the western U.S. to facilitate conservation and project planning, and are useful to decision-makers at all levels of government.

This can potentially result in mismatches or asynchronies in food and habitat resources that negatively impact individual fitness, population dynamics, and ecosystem function. Numerous studies have evaluated phenological shifts in terrestrial species, particularly birds and plants, yet far fewer evaluations have been conducted for marine animals. This project seeks to improve our understanding of shifts in the timing of seasonal migration, spawning or breeding, and biological development (i.e. life stages present, dominant) of coastal fishes and migratory waterbirds along the U.S Atlantic coast. The suite of species selected will include ecologically important coastal predatory fishes that also support recreational and commercial fisheries such as striped bass, bluefish, and flounder; coastal migratory waterbirds of conservation concern such as plovers, terns, and egrets; and forage fishes such as herring and menhaden. Ideally the suite of species selected will allow us to compare whether fish and waterbird predators are shifting their phenology at different rates than their primary prey and optimal habitat conditions, thus influencing trophic interactions and population dynamics. Where sufficient long-term species observations and environmental monitoring data exist, the following questions will be evaluated using ecological modelling and statistical techniques: (1) Can phenological shifts of key coastal fish and waterbirds be detected and at what spatial and temporal scales? (2) What environmental variables are correlated with observed shifts in phenology? (3) Are there key attributes of species that appear to result in the presence or absence of phenological shifts? A comprehensive literature review will be conducted simultaneous to data collection and synthesis to determine what is known, and what knowledge/information/data gaps exist regarding regional phenological responses of coastal species to climate change. Project results will help managers assess the vulnerability of coastal species to climate change by providing information on how they are responding to impacts in the region.

To remedy this, ecologists from The Nature Conservancy collaborated with a committee of scientists from various Canadian institutions to produce the first international map of terrestrial habitats for northeast North America. The project used extensive spatial data on geology, soils, landforms, wetlands, elevation and climate. Additionally, all four provinces contributed spatially comprehensive forest inventory data consisting of 3 million polygons depicting the tree composition of individual forest stands. The Atlantic Conservation Data Centre contributed precise spatial locations of over 200,000 species. The resulting map shows the distribution of 40 upland and wetland habitats, 29 of which are shared by both countries.

that maps upland and wetland wildlife habitats/ecological systems for the Northeastern US, including all 13 states from Maine to Virginia, west to New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and for the Maritime provinces of Canada (Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick) and southeastern Quebec. Mapped habitat types are drawn from the Northeastern Terrestrial Habitat Classification System (NETHCS) and from some ecological system types identifed by Canadian ecologists as being unique to Canada. The NETHCS is based on NatureServe\u2019s Ecological Systems Classification, augmented with additional information from individual state wildlife classifications and other information specific to wildlife managers. A terrestrial ecological system is defined as a mosaic of plant community types that tend to co-occur within landscapes with similar ecological processes, substrates, and/or environmental gradients, in a pattern that repeats itself across landscapes. Systems occur at various scales, from \"matrix\" forested systems of thousands of hectares to small patch systems, such as cliffs, basin wetlands, or barrens on a particular bedrock type, of one or two hectares.  This project was co-funded by the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center and the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative. An alternate reference to this product can be found here. The purpose of this mapping effort is to provide a common framework and language for conservation planning and wildlife management across jurisdictional borders. Specifically, the NE Terrestrial Habitat Classification System and this map are meant to: provide a standardized and consistent habitat and ecosystem classification at multiple scales across states, provinces, and international borders; facilitate interjurisdictional communication about habitats; offer managers a tool for understanding regional biodiversity patterns; allow for more effective and efficient habitat conservation across the region, including the priortization of habitat conservation activities.

While models can be used to predict the types of impacts that climate change might have on a landscape, uncertainty remains surrounding factors such as how quickly changes will occur and how specific resources will respond.   In order to plan for this uncertain future, managers have begun to use a tool known as scenario planning. In this approach, a subset of global climate model projections are selected that represent a range of plausible future climate scenarios for a particular area. Through a series of facilitated workshops, managers can then explore different management options under each scenario, enabling them to be proactive in the face of uncertainty. However, selecting and synthesizing climate information for scenario planning requires significant time and skills, and it can be difficult to predict exactly how resources might respond to a combination of climate, management actions, and other factors.   Therefore, the goals of this project are to develop a process for creating regional climate summaries that can also be used for local scenario planning, and to pilot an approach for enhancing scenario planning through simulation modeling. Researchers will draw on global climate model projections to develop several climate summaries for the northern Great Plains region. The summaries will then be used for local-scale climate adaptation planning efforts for Badlands National Park (South Dakota) and Knife River Indian Villages National Historical Site (North Dakota) and surrounding federal and tribal lands.

External impacts \u2013 such as climate change \u2013 can have significant impacts to these important parts of the region\u2019s landscape. Understanding the responses of lakes to these drivers is critical for species conservation and management decisions.   Water temperature data are foundational to providing this understanding and are currently the most widely measured of all aquatic parameters with over 400 unique groups monitoring water temperature in U.S. lakes and rivers. However, lake temperature data are lacking at the relevant spatial and temporal scales needed for decision-making, and there has been a lack of national coordination and synthesis of these data collection efforts. Assembling and harmonizing this wealth of data would provide a valuable resource for modeling, analyzing, and predicting water temperature.   This project will build upon previous work funded by the Northeast CASC that provided a foundation for modeling and predicting water temperature of approximately 11,000 lakes in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Project researchers are expanding those efforts by using the modeling techniques from the previous project, along with existing temperature data, to reconstruct a historical record of water temperatures from 1979 to 2018 and generate predictions for tens of thousands of lakes in the prairie pothole region of North and South Dakota. With this information, the team will also analyze the habitat suitability of these lakes to several fish species.   Data from this project will help water and natural resource managers clarify and quantify risks to fish populations, for example by identifying where the preferred thermal habitat of a species is projected to disappear and put the fish at risk of local extirpation.

At high elevations, headwater streams fared no better, with numerous streams experiencing periods of \u201cno flow\u201d for the first time in recorded history. These periods of low to no water flow can cause major water availability problems for wildlife and human communities, especially if they are not anticipated.  In order for land and resource managers to anticipate and prepare for future droughts, they need scientific information on water availability now and in the future at a landscape-scale and they need to know which headwater streams are particularly resilient to drought in order to place limited funds and resources into management of those streams. However, this scientific information is currently lacking and incomplete.  The objectives of this project are to: 1) develop a Headwaters Intermittency Prediction (HIP) tool that will provide managers with a prediction map of the expected permanence of water flows in streams; 2) utilize citizen-science techniques to gather steamflow data across the Northwest region; and 3) apply stream flow predictions to existing assessments of the vulnerability of aquatic species, such as the native bull trout, redband trout, and Lahontan cutthroat trout.

Raw streamflow permanence probabilities were produced by the PRObability of Streamflow PERmanence (PROSPER) model, a GIS raster-based empirical model of probabilistic predictions of a stream channel having year-round flow for any unregulated and minimally-impaired stream channel in the Pacific Northwest region, U.S. The model provides predictions of annual streamflow permanence probabilities at a 30-m spatial resolution based on monthly or annually updated values of climatic conditions and static physiographic variables associated with the upstream basin.

Research findings revealed that CBM is understood as both a method for generating data useful for decision-making and an expression of governance itself, rooted in understandings of stewardship, kinship and responsibility. Our findings also suggest that data quality and credibility, trust and legitimacy and relevance to decision contexts are key to mobilizing CBM data in relevant decision-making processes. We provide three recommendations to improve linkages between CBM programs and Indigenous governance: Indigenous governments must take a leading role in CBM programs; networked capacity between Indigenous governments can be built using a bridging organization; and CBM programs should be closely coupled with Indigenous environmental governance strategies.

Furthermore, information is lacking about how climate change and sea-level rise (which can influence the frequency and intensity of storms and subsequent flooding) are affecting this area, its communities, and their infrastructure. Through this project, researchers expanded the current understanding of coastal storms and climate change impacts on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of western Alaska by modeling (1) historical and future storms under likely sea-level rise scenarios, (2) flood extent, depth, and frequency for different storms, and (3) impacts of storms on wildlife abundance, nesting sites, and water quality.

This region contains millions of wetlands in which waterfowl breed and from which 50-80% of the continent's migratory ducks originate each year.  Previous modeling efforts indicated that climate change would result in a shift of suitable waterfowl breeding habitat from the central PPR to the southeastern portion of the region, an area where the majority of wetlands have been drained. If this future scenario were to materialize, a significant restoration effort would be needed in the southeastern PPR to support waterfowl production. However, more recent research has revealed that changes in climate are influencing these critical wetland habitats in novel ways, and previous modeling results may no longer be valid. Land and natural resource managers are in need of more accurate, up-to-date scientific information in order to make fully informed planning decisions about these important wetlands and waterfowl habitat.  This project aims to improve our understanding of how future climate changes might impact wetland ecosystems and waterfowl habitats of the PPR. Project researchers are using a newly developed wetland simulation model to simulate hydrologic and chemical conditions of prairie pothole wetlands under various climate change scenarios. Results will be compared to results from previous modeling and analysis efforts to gain a better understanding of future impacts to wetlands and the ability of prairie pothole wetlands to continue meeting the habitat needs of breeding waterfowl. Throughout this effort, the project team is working directly with land managers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Habitat and Population Evaluation Team and Chase Lake Wetland Management District in North Dakota to ensure that study results and science products can directly inform climate adaptation plans for waterfowl habitat.

for different whitebark pine(Pinus albicaulis) management activities, summarized by climate suitability zones. This data was developed for use in a landscape simulation modeling study aimed at evaluating how well alternative management strategies maintain whitebark pine populations under historical climate and future climate conditions. For the study, we developed three spatial management alternatives for whitebark pine in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem representing no active management, current management, and climate-informed management. These management alternatives were implemented in the simulaton model FireBGCv2 under historical climate and three future climate change scenarios - the HadGEM-ES, CESM1-CAM5, and CNRM-CM5 Global Circulation Models under the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario. We worked with the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee's (GYCC) Whitebark Pine Subcommittee to develop this spatial representation of their current management strategy. The treatments mapped represent a set of the treatments recommended in the GYCC Whitebark Pine 2011 Strategy document and include planting blister-rust resistant whitebark pine seedlings, competition removal thinning, wildland fire use and prescribed fire, and protection from mountain pine beetles using verbenone and carbaryl. We used historical and future projections of climate suitability based on species distribution models for whitebark pine (Chang et al. 2014) to map zones of core, deteriorating, and future whitebark pine habitat. Core zones were those areas that are currently suitable for whitebark and remain suitable in the future. Deteriorating zones were where the climatic conditions for whitebark pine are expected to decline. Future zones were areas that are projected to become newly suitable for whitebark pine. We then overlaid our climate zones for whitebark pine with similar projections of future climate suitability for all of whitebark pine\u2019s competitors - Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, and Douglas-fir (Piekielek et al. 2015. We discussed the different combinations of climate suitability zones (core, deteriorating, future) and potential future level of competition (low or high) from other species with the GYCC Whitebark Pine Subcommittee to determine which management activities should be prioritized within each management zone. The result is a map of management zones where different activities are prioritized to meet the goal of maintaining whitebark pine populations. This was used to determine which treatments would be implemented spatially during the simulation modeling, dependent upon additional criteria related to simulated stand-level conditions. In this dataset, we used the resulting map of spatially prioritized management activities to summarize the area prioritized for each management activity that fell within Core, Deteriorating, and Future climate suitability zones The purpose of this data is to provide a tabular summary of the area prioritized for treatment within each future climate suitability zone for whitebark pine and for each management scenario. These data were created to summarize treatment areas under current and climate-informed management strategies for a mid-range future climate scenario at the end of the century (CESM1-CAM5, RCP 8.5,

for different whitebark pine(Pinus albicaulis) management activities, summarized by land classes. This data was developed for use in a landscape simulation modeling study aimed at evaluating how well alternative management strategies maintain whitebark pine populations under historical climate and future climate conditions. For the study, we developed three spatial management alternatives for whitebark pine in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem representing no active management, current management, and climate-informed management. These management alternatives were implemented in the simulaton model FireBGCv2 under historical climate and three future climate change scenarios - the HadGEM-ES, CESM1-CAM5, and CNRM-CM5 Global Circulation Models under the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario. We worked with the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee's (GYCC) Whitebark Pine Subcommittee to develop this spatial representation of their current management strategy. The treatments mapped represent a set of the treatments recommended in the GYCC Whitebark Pine 2011 Strategy document and include planting blister-rust resistant whitebark pine seedlings, competition removal thinning, wildland fire use and prescribed fire, and protection from mountain pine beetles using verbenone and carbaryl. We used historical and future projections of climate suitability based on species distribution models for whitebark pine (Chang et al. 2014) to map zones of core, deteriorating, and future whitebark pine habitat. Core zones were those areas that are currently suitable for whitebark and remain suitable in the future. Deteriorating zones were where the climatic conditions for whitebark pine are expected to decline. Future zones were areas that are projected to become newly suitable for whitebark pine. We then overlaid our climate zones for whitebark pine with similar projections of future climate suitability for all of whitebark pine\u2019s competitors - Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, and Douglas-fir (Piekielek et al. 2015. We discussed the different combinations of climate suitability zones (core, deteriorating, future) and potential future level of competition (low or high) from other species with the GYCC Whitebark Pine Subcommittee to determine which management activities should be prioritized within each management zone. The result is a map of management zones where different activities are prioritized to meet the goal of maintaining whitebark pine populations. This was used to determine which treatments would be implemented spatially during the simulation modeling, dependent upon additional criteria related to simulated stand-level conditions. In this dataset, we used the resulting map of spatially prioritized management activities to summarize the area prioritized for each management activity that fell within different land classifications (mutliple use forests, National Park Service lands, Wilderness lands, and non-federal lands). The purpose of this data is to provide a tabular summary of the area prioritized for treatment within each land class and for each management scenario. These data were created to summarize treatment areas under current and climate-informed management strategies for a mid-range future climate scenario at the end of the century (CESM1-CAM5, RCP 8.5, 2069-2099).The data was used to produce figures in resulting manuscripts.", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a85a5a1e4b00f54eb3664dc", "item_phrases": ["developed three spatial management alternatives", "gycc whitebark pine 2011 strategy document", "different whitebark pine", "subalpine fir", "whitebark pine \u2019", "mutliple use forests", "competition removal", "similar projections", "yellowstone ecosystem", "greater yellowstone coordinating committee", "blister-rust resistant whitebark pine seedlings", "climate suitability", ".the data", "management alternatives", "management zones", "different land classifications", "future zones", "potential future level", "summarize treatment areas", "whitebark pine subcommittee", "core", "other species", "climatic conditions", "whitebark pine populations", "strategy", "future whitebark pine habitat", "engelmann", "map zones", "alternative management strategies", "greater yellowstone ecosystem", "simulaton model", "committee 's", "piekielek", "chang", "firebgcv2", "management zone", "future level", "mountain pine beetles", "gycc whitebark pine subcommittee", "landscape simulation", "competition removal thinning", "chang et al.", "management activity", "stand-level conditions", "hadgem-es", "wildland fire use", "whitebark pine \u2019 s competitors", "spatial management alternatives", "tabular summary", "future projections", "species distribution models", "management scenario", "future climate scenario", "2069-2099).the data", "resistant whitebark pine seedlings", "national park service lands", "different activities", "additional criteria", "gycc whitebark pine", "deteriorating", "whitebark pine", "management strategies", "climate zones", "three future climate change scenarios", "climate suitability zones", "lodgepole pine", "future climate conditions", "emissions scenario", "piekielek et al.", "future climate", "simulation modeling", "different whitebark pine(pinus albicaulis", "engelmann spruce", "mid-range future climate scenario", "current management strategy", "core zones", "different combinations", "management activities", "rcp", "historical climate", "simulaton model firebgcv2", "cesm1-cam5", "land classes", "douglas-fir", "pinus", "spatial representation", "yellowstone coordinating", "current management", "land class", "cnrm-cm5 global circulation models", "active management", "landscape simulation modeling study", "non-federal lands", "wilderness lands", "future climate suitability", "gycc", "cnrm-cm5 global circulation"], "weighted_sim": 0.639, "avg_sim": 0.6451}}}, "51e44c8ce4b08262df3d63e6": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/51e44c8ce4b08262df3d63e6", "proj_summary": "Natural climate variability can obscure or enhance long-term trends in experienced weather due to climate change.

We focused on five species of mammals in the alpine zone of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, including the federally endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep and the American pika, a species recently proposed for listing due to the loss of populations from altered climatic conditions. It is expected that there will be an upward expansion of trees and shrubs from lower elevations and that many or even most alpine meadows will be converted to woody dominated communities. Meadows provide critical habitat for many alpine mammal species, and their conversion could represent a major loss with severe consequences for the long-term persistence of these species. However, it is currently unknown whether the severity of the effects of meadow conversion on alpine mammals would be uniform or species-specific; all species could be impacted similarly; some species could be unaffected; or species currently not considered at risk may be seriously impacted. Moreover, while climate could potentially trigger changes in alpine vegetation communities, herbivorous and granivorous mammals could mediate the magnitude and extent of meadow conversion through their consumption of woody seeds and seedlings. In other words, feedbacks between climate and alpine mammals could result in the mammals \u201cmanaging their own habitat.\u201d Presently though, very little is known about vegetation or mammal communities in the alpine zone of the Sierra Nevada, especially in relation to climate change. Consequently, resource management agencies are seriously hindered in development of justifiable, long-term management strategies for bighorn sheep, pika, and other alpine mammals. To answer these questions, we modeled (1) the range shifts for five alpine mammal species and (2) the degree to which plant-animal interactions may alter what is often assumed to be an inevitable, climatically driven transition of alpine meadows to woody dominated communities in the Sierra Nevada.

LERI assesses anomalies in actual evapotranspiration (ETa), as percentiles, across the Contiguous US and northern Mexico at a 1-km spatial resolution. LERI is based on the ETa data produced by the U. S. Geological Survey using the operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model. SSEBop combines evapotranspiration fraction generated from remotely sensed MODIS thermal imagery, acquired every 8 days, with climatological atmospheric evaporative demand. To quantify LERI, a rank-based, non-parametric method is used to estimate percentiles of the SSEBop ETa, over a period of ETa accumulation, compared to the available period of record (January 2000 to present). LERI percentiles are also binned into four drought categories (LD0 - LD3) analogous to the US Drought Monitor (USDM) categories (i.e. D0-D3) and using the same percentile breaks that USDM considers for soil moisture. By its numerical design, LERI essentially represents the evaporative response of the landscape driven primarily by the anomalous state of soil moisture to meet the climatological atmospheric demand through a combination of evaporation (from soil and leaf surfaces) and transpiration (root-stomata-air) processes. Real-time and high-resolution assessment of this soil moisture state is extremely salient to understanding and forecasting ecological responses. LERI serves as an experimental drought-monitoring and early warning guidance tool and has the potential to inform research into understanding characteristics of Ecological Drought. Preliminary work finds LERI to closely track modeled moisture conditions in the upper soil layers (~10 cm). LERI can complement other drought-monitoring indices and modeled soil moisture products.

They will also use results from a hydrological and a vegetation model to explore the influence of the downscaling method on projections of vegetation, fire and streamflow.

The results of this project will inform strategic management decisions regarding wildfire control on public lands. By identifying the current and future vulnerability of forests to changes in climate and wildfires, this project will support managers in prioritizing areas for proactive fire management in the face of uncertainty.

Unfortunately, not only are these valuable ecosystems understudied compared to others, but they are also among the most sensitive to climate change. Climate change threatens wetlands by altering temperature and precipitation, which cause changes in water level and water temperature. Due to this threat, the international community and domestic agencies alike have highlighted the need to better understand wetlands in the face of climate change, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to the Ramsar Convention, to the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service.   Focusing on the Pacific Northwest region, this project substantially improves our understanding of wetlands and how they will respond to climate change. Researchers developed new methods to map and monitor wetlands, modeled historical and future wetland hydrologic conditions, and evaluated the impacts of climate change on wetlands and the species that rely on them.  Results show that montane wetlands \u2013 those found in high altitudes \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to climate change, which is causing reduced snowpack and longer summer drought, threatening the species that depend on them. Amphibians in particular, such as the Cascades frog, rely on wetlands for breeding and are at risk of local extinction due to the loss of suitable habitat.   This research produced information that is essential for managers seeking to understand the vulnerability of wetland ecosystems to climate change and to effectively plan for and mitigate its impacts. By studying wetlands in multiple locations throughout the Pacific Northwest, researchers discovered that the effects of climate change varied considerably between sites, suggesting that a one-size-fits all approach might not work \u2013 rather, management efforts may need to be tailored accordingly from site to site.

Already, high elevation areas have experienced rapidly increasing temperatures and there has been an increase in the frequency of drought across the Islands. These climatic changes could have significant impacts on Hawai`i\u2019s plants and animals. Changes in temperature and moisture may make current habitat no longer suitable for some species, and could allow invasive species to spread into new areas.   Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park is home to 23 species of endangered vascular plants and 15 species of endangered trees. Understanding how climate change may impact the park\u2019s plants is vital for their long-term survival. This project will assist managers of Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park in preparing for a changing climate by identifying how plant distributions within the park may shift under future climate conditions. Researchers will focus on the park\u2019s Special Ecological Areas \u2013 sites of critical importance roughly configured to protect representative plant communities and important species by controlling the most invasive incipient plants and animals.

Park (HAVO). The key objective of this project was to combine climate projections from the International Pacific Research Center (IPRC) and plant distribution models from Price et al. to produce a series of projected species range maps over the next century. Although the project focused on HAVO, the projected species range maps were created for seven of the main Hawaiian Islands. We stored the model output as rasters (.TIF files); additionally we created multi-panel maps of these rasters that are available separately. In summary, this dataset consists of 4,095 rasters that delineate plant species range, both present and future, for various climate change scenarios and years. The series covers 39 species, 7 islands, and 15 different combinations of climate trajectory and year. The contents of each raster varies slightly, but the contents can be determined from the specific filename. Filenames have a consistent naming convenion, as follows: Species name + island + file type + climate trajectory + year.TIF, where the following definitions apply: Species name = abbreviated code representing genus and species; Island = 1 of the main 7 Hawaiian Islands (Hawaii, Maui, Kahoolwe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, and Kauai); File type = one of 3 file types: (1) RANGE = present species range as of year 2000, (2) 80 PCT = binary raster of habitat suitability, (3) CHANGE TO 80 = raster showing the change in suitability between the year 2000 and the year indicated in the file name; Climate trajectory = lower (concave upward trajectory of change in rainfall and temperature over the century), middle (linear change in rainfall and temperature), upper (concave downward trajectory of change in rainfall and temperature), or future (where all three trajectories converge in 2090); Year = one of the following years: 2000, 2040, 2070, or 2090. For example, consider this filename: Acakoa Hawaii 80 pct future2090.tif. This filename defines the following: Species name = Acakoa (Acacia koa), Island = Hawaii island, File type = 80 pct, indicating that it is a binary raster of habitat suitability where a value of 1 means 80% of model iterations forecast suitable habitat, and a value of 0 means less than 80% of model runs project suitability, Climate trajectory = future, which represents the point in the future (2090) where the lower, middle and upper trajectories converge, Year = 2090 (end of century since that's when our climate data set series ends). The rasters produced in this study show the projected species range of 39 plant species at various points in time (from 2000-2090) and for various trajectories of climate change. The focus of this study was to project plant species range within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HAVO) on the island of Hawaii over the next century (2000-2090).

These fires were associated with extreme winds and were potentially also influenced by unusually dry conditions during several years leading up to the 2017 events. This fire season brought additional attention and emphasized the vital need for managers in the western U.S. to have access to scientific information on when and where to expect dangerous fire events. Understanding the multiple factors that cause extreme wildfire events is critical to short and long-term forecasting and planning. Seasonal climate measures such as temperature and precipitation are commonly used to explain fire occurrence and impact. However, weather events that produce extreme winds and severe temperatures over short periods of time can also have substantial impacts on fire behavior. In addition, multi-year droughts may increase fire potential by decreasing the amount of moisture in vegetation.   The goal of this project is to investigate the range of factors that may explain the variation in annual fire activity in both forested and non-forested landscapes in California. These factors will include the longer-term effects of extended droughts and the shorter-term effects of intense heat spells, low relative humidity, and extreme winds. In addition, researchers will evaluate the extent to which large fires are associated with particular fire ignition sources. Results should inform improved predictive models to show how long-term drought events and short-term extreme weather could impact future fire activity.   This project will evaluate the relative importance of these environmental factors over the last several decades, across different landscape types in California.

These changes have implications for the phenology, or the timing of natural life events (e.g. the timing of plant flowering in Spring or leaves falling in Autumn), of many plant species. However, not all species and regions are changing at the same rate, which can lead to mismatches (e.g. between the emergence of plants and pollinators in early spring). Many interactions in nature depend on timing and, as such, phenology affects nearly all aspects of the environment, including the abundance, distribution, and diversity of organisms, ecosystem services, food webs, even global water and carbon cycles.   Phenology is among the best indicators of climate change impacts, in large part because phenological events are some of the most sensitive biological responses to environmental changes. Researchers are rapidly developing datasets, models, and indices that can improve our understanding of changing phenology. However, most indices of phenological change are poorly suited for water-limited ecosystems, and existing models are lacking in their ability to represent phenological change at local scales that are relevant and useful for decision making.   This project is a step towards addressing these limitations. The project team aims to use local phenology data and climate information to build new phenology indices and models for the southwestern U.S. that address several significant information gaps, with a specific focus on creating useful and relevant data products and decision-support tools for managers. These models will be used to evaluate variations in historical phenology trends based on time period, plant type, geography, and moisture availability. The team plans to generate a phenology tool that resource managers in the Southwest can use to predict phenology events (e.g. plant green-up) based on a specified climate (historical, future near-term, and long-term).

Grasping the impacts of drought on fish and wildlife will be critical for management planning in the Southwest, as climate models project warmer, drier conditions for the region in the future.   Species are known to respond to environmental changes such as drought in different ways. Often, before changes are observed at the larger population level, they are first noticed at the level of the individual, through changes in an animal\u2019s behavior. For example, when vegetation becomes harder to find during a drought, individuals may increase the amount of time and energy they spend searching for food. If changes in behavior such as these are not sufficient to compensate for the lack of vegetation, the population as a whole could eventually experience decreased survival and reproductive rates.

Resource managers face the challenge of apportioning scarce water resources among competing uses, but they lack a systematic framework for comparing the costs and benefits of proposed water management decisions and conservation actions.  In 2016, Co-PIs Neeson and Moreno were funded by the Great Plains LCC to develop a decision support model for identifying the most cost-effective water conservation alternatives across the Red River basin. Here, we propose to extend this optimization model in three significant ways to support cost-effective conservation decisions in the face of climate change and drought. First, we will incorporate SC CSC-developed predictions of rainfall, runoff, and stream flows through the year 2099 into our hydrologic database. Using this database, our enhanced optimization model will enable decision-makers to visualize and evaluate multiple competing water use scenarios under future drought conditions. Second, we will use SC-CSC predictions of stream flows and temperature through the year 2099 to estimate the future distributions of 28 fish species of conservation concern across the Red River.

Despite its naturally warm waters, the basin supports abundant redband trout. These are some of the largest-bodied trout in the entire U.S., and are a culturally and economically important species, providing the last remaining subsistence fishery for the Klamath Tribes and drawing recreational anglers. The ability of this coldwater species to survive in one of the region\u2019s warmest watersheds could hold valuable clues for conservation in the face of warming global temperatures, which represents one of the biggest threats to North America\u2019s coldwater fish.  Previous research has found that redband trout rely heavily on spring-fed habitats. These springs provide pockets of cooler water for relief from extreme temperatures in the summer, and comparably warmer waters for spawning in the winter. Fish will migrate long distances to spawn in these habitats, sometimes 100 miles or more. However, there is currently a lack of information on how these \u201crefugia\u201d are used by fish throughout their life cycle. This prevents managers from understanding how refugia scale-up across the landscape and support fish at the population level. The goal of this project is to identify how redband trout use coldwater refugia at each life stage to survive extreme heat. Researchers will develop maps of existing spring-fed habitats and the life-stages that each supports, in addition to maps of currently impaired spring-fed habitats and the life-stages that they would likely support if restored.  This information will be critical for restoration planners, including those with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Trout Unlimited, and the Klamath Tribes, as they refine strategic approaches for ensuring that key cold water habitats are protected and restored. For example, the results will be incorporated into two of the most important habitat restoration plans in the western U.S. - the Upper Klamath Basin Watershed Action Plan and the Klamath Anadromous Fish Reintroduction Implementation Plan.

According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in 2011, 33.1 million people fished and spent $41.8 billion in the United States alone. Yet to date, little comprehensive research has been conducted to investigate the effects of climate change on inland fisheries at a large scale.    The aim of this project was to summarize the current state of knowledge, identify data gaps, and suggest future research directions around four major themes dealing with climate related impacts on fishes and fisheries. To answer these questions, researchers lead a workshop for experts in climate change and fish ecology from universities, state and provincial governments, and federal agencies throughout the U.S. and Canada. Together, the experts compiled the findings of 48 studies, mainly focused on salmon and trout, and solicited feedback from inland fishery experts around the world.  The findings of this effort show that climate change is poised to impact inland fish in a variety of ways.

The combination of these environmental conditions makes semi-arid and arid regions difficult to represent with a hydrologic model, especially extreme events. In some cases, overestimating flows may be acceptable to water managers (e.g., vulnerability of infrastructures), but could greatly affect estimates of fish species persistence.

To maximize the number of potential explanatory variables and survey locations available in the Canadian River basin for the development of flow-ecology response models and minimize bias and uncertainty, a combination of these approaches is likely warranted.

Yet wildfire is increasing in the West, turning biodiverse, shrub-based ecosystems dominated by sagebrush into grasslands containing invasive species such as cheatgrass and less overall plant and animal diversity. These transformations negatively impact people and ecosystems by reducing habitat quality for wildlife and the aesthetic value of the landscape.   Understanding how sagebrush communities are already responding and will continue to respond to changes in wildfire, invasive species, and climate is a priority for managers in the West. However, we currently know very little about how invasive grasses and fire will affect big sagebrush rangelands in the future and whether all big sagebrush ecosystems in the western U.S. will be negatively affected. In collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this project aims to fill this gap by assessing the vulnerability of sagebrush plant communities to future changes in climate, wildfire, and invasive grasses. To do this, researchers will predict sagebrush plant community responses to climate variability, wildfire-driven increases in invasive grasses,and grazing pressure at 200 sites across the West that are particularly important for the greater sage-grouse. They will then produce maps of what future sagebrush plant communities could look like by mid- and late-century for local and regional land and wildlife managers.

boundaries.  Human impacts occurring throughout the Northeast and Midwest United States, including urbanization, agriculture, and dams, have multiple effects on the region\u2019s streams which support economically valuable stream fishes.  Changes in climate are expected to lead to additional impacts in stream habitats and fish assemblages in multiple ways, including changing stream water temperatures.  To manage streams for current impacts and future changes, managers need region-wide information for decision-making and developing proactive management strategies.  Our project met that need by integrating results of a current condition assessment of stream habitats based on fish response to human land use, water quality impairment, and fragmentation by dams and road crossings with estimates of which stream habitats may change in the future.  Results are available for all streams in the NE CSC region through a spatially-explicit, web-based viewer (FishTail).  With this tool, managers can evaluate how streams of interest are currently impacted by land uses and assess if those habitats may change with climate.  These results, available in a comparable way throughout the NE CSC, provide natural resource managers, decision-makers, and the public with a wealth of information to better protect and conserve stream fishes and their habitats.  These data are integrated into a web-based decision support viewer (FishTail): 1) current condition of streams determined from disturbances limiting stream fishes, 2) future conditions resulting from changes in climate, and, 3) changes in water temperature for key locations resulting from climate changes for all streams of the NE CSC region.

Unfortunately, many of these ecosystems are increasingly under threat due to rapid human development, and management agencies are increasingly aware of the potential effects that climate change will have on these ecosystems. Natural resource managers and conservation planners can be effective at preserving ecosystems in the face of these stressors only if they can adapt current conservation efforts to increase the overall resilience of the system. Climate change, in particular, challenges many of the basic assumptions used by conservation planners and managers. Previous conservation planning efforts identified and prioritized areas for conservation based on the current environmental conditions, such as habitat quality, and assumed that conditions in conservation lands would be largely controlled by management actions (including no action). Climate change, however, will likely alter important system drivers (temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise) and make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain recent historic conditions in conservation lands into the future. Climate change will also influence the future conservation potential of non-conservation lands, further complicating conservation planning. Therefore, there is a need to develop and adapt effective conservation strategies to cope with the effects of climate and landscape change on future environmental conditions.  Traditional urban growth models are very localized and data-intensive and lack the capability to be applied across large regions. In response to these limitations the North Carolina Cooperative Research Unit began using the USGS SLEUTH urban growth model to develop urbanization scenarios as part of the Southeast Regional Assessment Project (SERAP). Extensive modifications of the model framework and calibration were undertaken that resulted in the ability to rapidly develop urbanization scenarios for very large regions, such as the Appalachian, Caribbean, and Gulf Coastal Plain Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). This new modeling effort allows LCC\u2019s to address fundamental questions that affect conservation planning over decadal time scales.

long-term conservation strategies. The SAMBI DSL project used predicted urban growth models described herein to inform future landscape conditions that were also based climate change impacts and vegetative community succession. These future landscape conditions were then applied as a context for land use and management decisions in conservation planning.  SLEUTH, named for the model input datasets (Slope, Land use, Excluded, Urban, Transportation and Hillshade) is the evolutionary product of the Clarke Urban Growth Model that uses cellular automata, terrain mapping and land cover change modeling to address urban growth (Jantz et al, 2009; NCGIA 2011). SLEUTH provides urban growth projections which are useful across a range of applications; including wildlife habitat analysis, conservation planning, and land cover dynamics analysis. SLEUTH incorporates four growth rules (Spontaneous Growth, New Spreading Centers, Edge Growth and Road-Influenced Growth) to model the rate and pattern of urbanization. The model simulates not only outward growth of existing urban areas, but also growth along transportation corridors and new centers of urbanization. SLEUTH incorporates five parameters (Dispersion, Breed, Spread, Slope and Road Gravity) into the growth rules which project future urbanization. Possible parameter coefficient values range between 1 and 100. During calibration every possible combination of these five parameter coefficients (between defined start and stop values and by a defined step size) is applied to the growth rules, in order to find the combination that best matches past urbanization patterns observed in the training data. Once found, the model is run in prediction mode using these parameter values in the growth rules. The model produces one urban growth cycle per year. For each growth cycle, a GIF image is produced showing the probability of urbanization for each pixel.

These changes include shifting precipitation patterns, warming temperatures, and more frequent extreme events, such as droughts and floods. As these changes occur, managers face different challenges and have different needs, depending on the resources they manage. For example, water managers are focused on responding to changes in water availability, while wildlife managers may be more concerned with changing habitat conditions \u2013 whether it be for migratory waterfowl, coldwater fish, or large mammals.   In the face of these changes, managers are seeking effective strategies for managing resources. To meet this goal, managers require usable and timely information that is relevant to current needs \u2013 known as \u201cactionable science\u201d. The goal of this project is to identify best practices for developing actionable science results, which are often built around strong stakeholder engagement. Researchers will evaluate the different processes \u2013 including mechanisms of stakeholder engagement \u2013 that have been employed by the North Central Climate Science Center to provide managers with actionable science that supports climate adaptation planning.

To address this need, a primary goal of the Southwest Climate Science Center is to develop actionable science \u2013 scientific information that can be easily used to inform these decisions.   Evidence shows that more collaborative forms of knowledge development and exchange between scientists and decision makers tend to produce information that is considered more trusted and usable, and lead to higher-quality decisions about environmental management. However, there is still a need for more effective ways to integrate collaboration and co-production of knowledge into established research programs and organizational frameworks. There is also a need for a process to effectively evaluate projects that no longer resemble standard academic research because they integrate decision-makers in a full and collaborative manner.   The project researchers have developed a framework for the evaluation of collaboratively produced climate science that specifically addresses the process of producing and outcomes of actionable science. Through this project, the team is using this framework to evaluate a sample of projects funded by the Southwest CSC to determine: 1) To what extent the science is being applied to management decisions in the Southwest region, 2) What the barriers are to the use of science, and 3) Which practices or strategies are most associated with the production of actionable science.

While a complete climate prediction may be intractable at this time -- for instance, the climate projections may not incorporate land use changes and solar fluctuations into the boundary conditions -- we proposed a framework to quantify known uncertainty that is also flexible enough to adapt to advances in climate predictions. A key advantage of the hierarchical approach is that it incorporates various sources of observations and includes established scientific knowledge, and uncertainties associated with each. This work is critical for monitoring effects of climate change since lakes and streams have been identified as sentinels of environmental change. The proposed hierarchical modeling approach should help to account for these uncertainties, in particular variability of relevant climate conditions across temporal and spatial scales, so forecasts of community or population response to a given climate change scenario include realistic measures of uncertainty. The approach combined available data from numerous agencies (e.g., US Geological Survey, US Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service) and models (e.g., North American Regional Climate Change Program and sturgeon population, movement, and bioenergetics model) across a variety of scales. This work provides the framework for describing the potential consequences of global climate changes on large riverine ecosystems, alerting decision-makers to the most likely consequences, and producing a new suite of indicators of large riverine ecosystem change and health. The project also provides explicit means for scaling results up or down multiple hierarchical levels and associated uncertainty.

In western Montana for example, snowshoe hare make up 96% of lynx diet. In fact, hares are critical players in forest ecosystems because most carnivores prey on them.   The main way that snowshoe hares escape predation is through camouflage. In response to changes in day length, snowshoe hares molt seasonally, changing color from brown to white in the winter to blend in with the snowfall and hide from predators. However, due to shorter snow seasons caused by recent changes in climate, snowshoe hares are turning white before it snows, making them more visible to predators. Because 21 other species around the world also undergo these seasonal coat color changes, snowshoe hares also represent a window to understand climate change effects on wild animals.   The goal of this project was to investigate the causes and consequences of climate change induced color mismatch in snowshoe hares, focusing on populations in the Seeley-Swan valley and Gallatin National Forest in Montana. With the cooperation of multiple partners, including the University of Montana, the National Science Foundation, NASA, the National Park Service, Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and the U.S. Forest Service, this research combined field data with climate projections to directly evaluate how well wild animals might be able to adapt and persist in the face of climate change.    Results of this project show that snowshoe hares do not have much ability to adapt through behaviors such as hiding or fleeing more readily when they are white and mismatched against a brown snowless background. Also, they cannot readily adjust their color molt to track shorter snow seasons. Mismatched white animals on snowless ground were found to have a 7% higher chance of being killed each week by predators than color matched animals.   These results mean that without evolutionary changes, wild hares are highly likely to experience severe population declines by the end of the century. However, such declines are not inevitable, as the researchers note tangible ways that land managers could increase wildlife resilience to climate change by fostering \u2018evolutionary rescue\u2019 to climate change. In short, this project both provides specific information on snowshoe hares to wildlife managers, and also provides a novel way to foster resilience to climate change through evolutionary change.

This project will produce effective soil moisture-based drought indices that decision-makers can use retrospectively or in real-time with data from existing monitoring networks to assess drought severity in the South Central region or across the US. Researchers will also create the first regional soil moisture database for the South Central US, which will further support drought monitoring and other climate-related research efforts in this drought-prone region.

We know that plants and animals may adjust the timing of certain phenological events, such as tree flowering or migration, based on changes in weather. However, it\u2019s important that we also understand how the timing of phenological events is changing over longer time frames, as climate conditions change.   While some species appear to be adjusting to the increase in unseasonal temperatures, drought, and extreme storms that have come with climate change, not all species are responding at the same speed or in the same ways. This can disrupt the manner in which species interact and the way that ecosystems function overall. For example, plants may bloom before butterflies emerge to pollinate them, or caterpillars may emerge before migratory birds arrive to feed them to their young.   For natural resource managers, understanding how changing climate conditions are impacting plant and animal phenology is essential for making effective adaptive management decisions. This project will support management needs in the Pacific Northwest by synthesizing and communicating what we know about the impacts of climate change on phenology in the region, as well as identifying what gaps exist in the research and what tools are available to support management planning.

The study includes both top-level, regional analyses and more detailed case studies of individual lakes. The goal of this project was to provide (1) projections of land use and climate change impacts on the trophic status of Midwestern coldwater glacial lakes, (2) projections of land use and climate change impacts on the regional distribution of coldwater lake oxythermal habitat, and (3) guidance on the types of coldwater lakes in which locations will be the most or least vulnerable to land use and climate change. To do so, methods were developed for conducting regional analyses of large numbers of coldwater lakes, including models for watershed nutrient loading and lake response models. Retrospective analyses were also conducted on trends in ice-out, water temperature, and fish assemblages in Minnesota\u2019s lakes, based on historic data. These models can then be used to help inform management decisions regarding the protection and restoration of lakes and their watersheds with respect to maintenance of cold water refugia under future climate and land use scenarios. The goal of this project was to produce a Watershed Nutrient Loading Model and a Lake Response Model.The former is comprised of regional models for nutrient loading to coldwater lakes that will enable prediction of the changes in lake nutrient loading and concentration in response to changes in land use and climate. Meanwhile, the latter is a deterministic lake model (MINLAKE) calibrated for current conditions for a set of coldwater Cisco lakes in Minnesota. The calibrated models can then be used to predict changes in habitat (temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles) in response to climate change for several global climate change scenarios.

Although general adaptation strategies have been suggested for sustaining forests, it is unclear how effective these strategies would be for maintaining forests \u2013 and the wildlife that depend on forests \u2013 at local or regional levels. In addition, these strategies have not been developed into explicit decision-support tools that could guide regional conservation planning. This lack of information hampers the ability of resource managers to anticipate landscape-level changes in forests and identify appropriate adaptive responses.   Focusing on the Adirondack Region of New York, the goal of this project is to inform forest and wildlife management decisions in light of changing conditions. Researchers will use a framework that incorporates the effects of future disturbances (e.g. wildfires or drought), insects and diseases, changing climate conditions, and different adaptive management approaches on forest conservation. Using this integrative approach, researchers will be able to model the future distribution and condition of forests under different scenarios of climate change, disturbance, and invasive species, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of different adaptive management strategies under alternative scenarios.   The results of this project will inform not only forest conservation, but also wildlife conservation in the Adirondacks.

However wildfire, which is becoming more common as temperatures rise, can disrupt the role of mountain forests in the hydrologic cycle. Uncertainty about the interactions between wildfire and snow-water, and how these interactions may change as climate conditions shift, impedes effective water resource planning in the region.  Until recently, there has been no method available to characterize the potential effects of forest fire on snow-water (water from melted snow) resources.

This project seeks to understand the effects of the hotter drought on Sierra Nevada forests across three different spatial scales (from leaves to landscapes): (1) water stress and the physiology of individual trees; (2) measurements of foliage dieback and tree mortality in tree populations; and (3) large landscape mapping of the vulnerability of forests to drought using airborne sensors. Linking the findings across these scales will help us better understand the thresholds of forest stress and dieback \u2013 including for the iconic giant sequoias \u2013 and how and why these thresholds vary across landscapes. Important products will include maps of forest vulnerability to hotter droughts of the future. Our results will help forest managers target forest treatments \u2013 such as prescribed fire \u2013 that are aimed at increasing the likelihood that forests will persist in the face of future climatic changes.

The modeled projections were then used to evaluate climate change effects on high priority bird species, waterfowl, amphibians, and fisheries. In particular, the researchers sought to answer two key questions: (1) what are the impacts of predicted climate change on ecosystem structure, processes, and services, particularly those affecting DOI trust resources and species, in the LMV? and (2) will current restoration, mitigation, and adaptation strategies meet desired conservation targets and outcomes under projected future climates?.

This subspecies appears to be more vulnerable to drought than more northern subspecies, because it occupies small and fragmented streams which are at greater risk of drying up during drought. Most notably, in 2002 drought in the Southwest resulted in the loss of 14 different Rio Grande cutthroat trout populations \u2013 about 10% of the total population.   While it is known that drought is having an effect on Rio Grande cutthroat trout, the specific ways in which individuals and populations are affected by drought remains unclear. In light of worsening drought conditions in the Southwest, the need to identify the specific impacts of drought on the Rio Grande cutthroat trout is only increasing. This project is examining the effects of reduced stream flow and higher stream temperature on Rio Grande cutthroat trout to identify how factors such as the survival of individual fish and the growth rates of entire populations may be changing. Once these effects have been identified, researchers will model the long-term survival of the subspecies under predicted future drought conditions.   Although the Rio Grande cutthroat trout is not at immediate risk of extinction according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, more than half of the remaining populations are considered to be in fair or poor condition. The results of this research will directly inform managers as to the vulnerability of this species to drought and which actions can be taken to increase the survival of Rio Grande cutthroat trout during drought.

There is ample literature on the effects of long-term climate change and short-term climate variability on the occurrence of droughts. However, it is unclear whether this information meets the needs of relevant stakeholders and actually contributes to reducing the vulnerability or increasing the resilience of communities to droughts. For example, are the methods used to characterize the severity of drought \u2013 known as drought indices \u2013 effective tools for predicting the actual damage felt by communities?   As droughts continue to increase in frequency and severity, the need to understand community vulnerability and resilience to drought is only growing. Focusing on New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, this study sought to answer several key questions. First, researchers examined whether existing drought indices are effective in predicting the occurrence of drought events and their actual damages. Second, researchers explored why some communities suffer less damage from drought and recover faster than others. Finally, researchers identified strategies for encouraging the adoption of water conservation behaviors among residents. So far, results show that drought indices are overall useful tools for predicting drought damage and that a community\u2019s resilience to drought is often tied to socioeconomic conditions.   This research was conducted in partnership with two Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. In addition to gaining the scientific knowledge of the linkages between drought indices, damages, and community resilience, this research (1) developed tools to measure drought resilience, (2) identified key indicators of resilience, (3) identified the gaps between drought indices and actual damages, and (4) identified the factors that influence residents\u2019 decisions to adopt adaptive measures.

Although ample literature exists on the climatological aspects of drought, little is known on whether existing drought indices can predict the damages and how different human communities respond and adapt to the hazard. This project examines (1) whether existing drought indices can predict the occurrence of drought events and their actual damages; (2) how the adaptive capacity (i.e., resilience) varies across space; and (3) what public outreach and engagement effort would be most effective for mitigation of risk and impacts. The study region includes all 503 counties in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. This data set was created to examine the first objective of the project. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI) data, available only at the climate-division level, were downscaled into county-level indices over the 1975-2010 period. The drought damage data, acquired from the Spatial Hazards Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUSTM), were tabulated for the same time period. Statistical correlations were conducted between drought indices and drought damages to test whether these indices accurately represent the drought damage in the study region. This data set contains the two county-level drought indices and drought damage for the period 1975-2010, which should be useful to future related studies. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI) are publicly available data, collected from Midwestern Regional Climate Center (MRCC), which mainly originate from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The PDSI and PHDI are published weekly and aggregated into a monthly dataset by NOAA, at the climate divisional level. Although several drought indices are available; which captures somewhat different aspects of drought conditions (Heim 2000), the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI; Palmer 1965) and Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI; Karl 1986) are commonly used, highly regarded, and readily available metrics. The PDSI, a weekly index of long-term moisture conditions, is produced by NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center and is calibrated to \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 conditions for its own subset of a state known as a climate division, with 0.0 representing average soil moisture conditions at that climate division for that time of year. Positive values represent above-normal moisture conditions for that location and negative values suggest below-normal soil moisture. Because the water balance calculations for PDSI include lags to take into account deep soil moisture conditions, PDSI is often considered in many applications a reasonable and versatile index of medium-term moisture. For evaluating longer-term hydrological conditions, the PHDI may prove more useful, because it's even longer-lagged response to changes in moisture conditions may better reflect the changes in groundwater availability and reservoir supplies that would be characteristic of drought impacts on communities\u2019 long-term water supply and demand (Guttman 1991). These two indices remain the most widely used and cited measures of drought. The versatility and availability of the PDSI and PHDI on a near-real-time basis make these two indices most desirable for use by environmental planners. For the study, these monthly data are extracted for the 45 climate divisions in the five-state region over the 1975-2010 period.", "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/582a1085e4b01fad8725485c", "item_phrases": ["account deep soil moisture conditions", "national oceanic", "guttman 1991", "longer-term hydrological conditions", "karl", "louisiana", "above-normal moisture conditions", "karl 1986", "available data", "environmental planners", "mexico", "0.0 representing average soil moisture conditions", "noaa \u2019", "reservoir supplies", "weekly index", "climate divisions", "public outreach", "midwestern", "climate prediction center", "pdsi", "statistical correlations", "palmer hydrological drought index", "climate division", "county-level drought indices", "what public outreach", "communities \u2019 long-term water", "natural hazard", "heim", "own subset", "united states", "palmer 1965", "midwestern regional climate center", "drought events", "atmospheric administration", "water balance calculations", "palmer drought severity index", "atmospheric", "climate prediction", "heim 2000", "first objective", "palmer", "different human communities", "negative values", "monthly data", "climate-division level", "spatial hazards events", "arkansas", "drought damages", "below-normal soil moisture", "actual damages", "positive", "average soil moisture conditions", "ample literature", "time period", "groundwater availability", "drought damage data", "versatile index", "study region", "several drought indices", "project examines", "costly damage", "phdi", "different aspects", "guttman", "long-term moisture conditions", "human communities", "adaptive capacity", "drought impacts", "climate divisional level", "\u2018 \u2018 normal \u2019 \u2019 conditions", "near-real-time basis", "inflicts costly damage", "\u2019 s", "drought indices", "ample literature exists", "moisture conditions", "drought damage", "two county-level drought indices", "communities \u2019 long-term water supply", "available metrics", "oceanic", "\u2018 \u2018", "county-level indices", "losses database", "climate", "texas", "drought conditions", "medium-term moisture", "new mexico", "mrcc", "soil moisture conditions", "statistical", "climatological aspects", "engagement effort", "noaa", "normal \u2019 \u2019 conditions", "five-state region", "monthly dataset", "sheldustm", "oklahoma", "drought", "same time period"], "weighted_sim": 0.6474, "avg_sim": 0.6539}}}, "594aa23de4b062508e36f43c": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/594aa23de4b062508e36f43c", "proj_summary": "Wildfires scorched 10 million acres across the United States in 2015, and for the first time on record, wildfire suppression costs topped $2 billion.

Advancements in wildfire danger modeling may increase wildfire preparedness, and therefore decrease loss of life, property, and habitat due to wildfire. Still, soil moisture\u2014an important determinant of wildfire risk\u2014is not currently used for wildfire danger assessments because data are generally unavailable at the appropriate scales of space and time.  Our project addresses this knowledge gap by developing and disseminating improved wildfire danger assessments that are rooted in high precision estimates of soil moisture. Primary goals are (1) develop an effective model of soil moisture for the Red River and Rio Grande basins using soil maps and climate data; (2) quantify the relationships between modeled soil moisture and wildfire probability; and (3) distribute soil moisture and wildfire probability maps for both basins. Primary outcomes of this work include new web-based tools for exploring soil moisture dynamics in near real-time and relating those dynamics to wildfire probability. We will initiate an aggressive outreach program to ensure our results will have practical applications relevant to a wide range of stakeholders interested in drought, flooding, and fire monitoring and prediction.

Today, sea-level rise, more frequent and stronger storms, saltwater intrusion, and warming water temperatures are among the threats that are altering these important habitats.   To support future planning and conservation of California\u2019s near-shore habitats, researchers examined current weather patterns, elevations, tides, and sediments at these sites to see how they affect plants and animals.

We installed deep rod surface elevation tables (SETs) to quantify the relative contributions of surface and subsurface processes to present-day elevation change (i.e., root growth, decomposition, compaction, water flux), shallow subsidence (accretion \u2013 elevation), and shallow subsidence between shallow (root zone) and deeper (to &gt;10 m) portions of the soil profile. We installed four SETs at each marsh site, following methods described by Cahoon et al. 2002 and Webb et al., 2013. We established two SETs in low marsh and two in high marsh at each site after visual assessment of vegetation composition and distance from tidal source. We deployed each SET with three feldspar marker horizon plots. When the SET instrument is attached to the installed bench mark, the SET provides a constant reference plane in space from which the distance to the sediment surface can be measured by means of pins lowered to the sediment surface. SET measurements will be taken by reading the heights of nine pins lowered to the sediment surface using the SET instrumentation at 4 directions, which are 90 degrees from each other. Repeated measurements of elevation can be made with high precision because the orientation of the table in space remains fixed for each sampling. We are conducting on-going measurements every three months at all sites. We installed surface elevation tables (SETs) at our seven study sites between September and December 2013 (n = 24) to evaluate present-day changes in marsh surface elevation. As of the time of this report, we collected two to seven baseline readings at each site (Figure 24; Table 12). Early results suggest that the magnitude of marsh surface elevation change varied within sites and between low and high tidal marsh. Net marsh surface elevation change was positive in both high and low marsh in Bolinas and Mad River. In contrast, surface elevation declined in high marsh locations at Morro, Pt. Mugu, San Pablo, and Tijuana. These initial findings should be considered inconclusive until several additional years of data have been collected. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast.

\u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4).

At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS).

We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses in this study including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and

conducted concurrently. Over 2,000 intertidal plots were sampled for plant cover, frequency of occurrence, and species richness across the six study sites. Approximately 57 vascular plant species were found in the study, including grasses, rushes, forbs and sedges. Vegetated marsh ranged in elevation from approximately local mean tide level (MTL) to the marsh-upland transition zone (upland plots, defined as areas estimated to flood 1 time per year on average, were not considered for further analysis). We assessed vegetation cover and species richness concurrently with elevation surveys at approximately 25% of the elevation points. We visually assessed percent cover of all plant species within a 0.25 m2 quadrat, and recorded the average and maximum height (measured to the nearest centimeter) of each species. Total plant cover in a plot could exceed 100% due to vegetation layering. Vascular plant nomenclature generally follows Baldwin et al. (2012). We used long-term (10 yr) NOAA tide data to assess inundation relationships with local elevation and thereby define the elevation limits of four intertidal habitat zones for evaluation of SLR impacts to marshes along the California coastline: low marsh, middle marsh, high marsh and transitional marsh. First, to determine region-specific relationships between elevation and inundation, we compiled data from all recorded high tides from 2004-2013 at three NOAA tidal stations along the US west coast: San Diego, San Francisco, and Charleston, Oregon (tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). Using these time series, we determined the percentage of high tides that reached a given elevation. We defined low marsh as all elevations between the lowest vegetation plot and the elevation reached by 50% of all recorded high tides (low marsh flooded at least once daily, on average). We defined middle marsh as habitat flooded by 50-25% of all high tides (flooding once every 1-2 days, on average), and high marsh as elevations flooded by 3-25% of all high tides (flooding at least twice per month, but less than once every other day, on average). We defined transition zone marsh as habitat flooded by 0.14-3% of all high tides (flooding at least once annually, but no more than twice per month, on average). Mudflat occurred between local mean-lower low water (MLLW) and the lowest extent of emergent tidal marsh vegetation; subtidal habitat occurred. Using the regional NOAA data, we determined the z* ranges that corresponded to the four marsh zones as defined above.

At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses in this study including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones.

surveys at all sites between 2009 and 2013 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK)Global Positioning System (GPS) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses in this study including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones.

We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and

GPS Viva rover, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat (Bass Hunter, Cabelas, Sidney, NE; Figure 7). The RTK GPS obtained high resolution elevations of the water surface (reported precision 10 cm water depth. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. We suspended the bar-check plate below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. Morro Bay did not have bathymetry data, therefore we downloaded LIDAR data collected by the NOAA California Coastal Conservancy Coastal Topobathy Project: Digital Elevation Model 2009-2011.For bathymetry at Pt. Mugu, we used data collected by the Seafloor Mapping Lab (SFML) at the California State University Monterey Bay (Seafloor Mapping Lab, 2013). Side scan data for Pt. Mugu were acquired using a Swathplus interferometric sonar with an Applanix Position and Orientation System, Marine Vessel (POS MV 320 v.4) system (position accuracy \u00b1 2 m, pitch, roll and heading accuracy \u00b1 0.02\u00b0, heave accuracy \u00b1 5% or 5 cm). Bathymetric data were post-processed using CARIS HIPS hydrographic data cleaning system software. Derived products are at 1m resolution and relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum with geoid09. Data acquisition, post-processing, and final products derived from multibeam bathymetry data were handled by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at CSUMB. We synthesized the bathymetry data to create a DEM of the mudflat and subtidal regions at Mad River, San Pablo, Bolinas, Morro, Pt.

(Swanson et al., 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Mad River Slough marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change.

The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "item_url":

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Tijuana Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services.

conducted survey-grade elevation surveys at all sites between 2009 and 2013 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK)Global Positioning System (GPS) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses in this study including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones.

We deployed 1-4 water level loggers and a single conductivity logger at all sites over the study period (Figure 6; Table 2). Primary water level loggers and conductivity loggers were deployed in major tidal channels connecting the marshes to the estuary. Secondary water level loggers were deployed in the upper reaches of second-order tidal channels to capture high tides and determine inundation patterns. Water level readings were collected every six minutes. We used data from the primary water level logger at each site to develop local hydrographs and inundation rates. Loggers were surveyed by RTK GPS at least once during the period of deployment. We corrected all raw water level data with local time series of barometric pressure using Solinst barometric loggers (Model 3001, Solinst Canada Ltd., Georgetown, Ontario, Canada), additional Hobo loggers (Model U-20-001-01-Ti, Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA, USA) or barometric pressure from local airports (distance less than 10 miles). We assessed salinity and water temperature in the tidal channels at each site with Odyssey conductivity/temperature loggers (Dataflow Systems Pty Limited, Christchurch, New Zealand), after an initial period of unsuccessful deployment of Hobo conductivity loggers (Model U-24-001, Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA, USA), that were recalled due to manufacture error and data inconsistencies. We converted specific conductance values obtained with the Odyssey loggers to practical salinity units (PSU) using the equation in UNESCO (1983). At Tijuana, we used salinity data from the National Estuarine Research Reserve System Centralized Data Management Office website, using the Boca Rio station (TJRBRWQ, 32.5595\u00b0 N latitude, -117.1288\u00b0 W longitude; cdmo.baruch.sc.edu). The water level data was used to estimate local tidal datums for all sites using procedures outlined in the NOAA Tidal Datums Handbook (NOAA 2003). Only local MHW and MHHW was calculated because the loggers were positioned in the intertidal and therefore could not be used to compute lower datums. Mean tide level (MTL) was estimated for each site by using NOAA\u2019s VDATUM model (v.3.4) at the location of the primary water level logger or at a nearby site in the estuary if the VDATUM model domain did not include the water level logger location. At Bolinas we used NOAA published values for MTL, MHW and MHHW; the station was located about 2km from the study site. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast.", "item_url":

Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Newport Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Morro Bay Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "item_url":

vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS).

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast.", "item_url":

bathymetric surveys using a shallow-water echo-sounding system (Takekawa et al., 2010, Brand et al., 2012) comprised of an acoustic profiler (Navisound 210; Reson, Inc., Slangerup, Denmark), Leica RTK GPS Viva rover, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat (Bass Hunter, Cabelas, Sidney, NE; Figure 7). The RTK GPS obtained high resolution elevations of the water surface (reported precision 10 cm water depth. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. We suspended the bar-check plate below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. Morro Bay did not have bathymetry data, therefore we downloaded LIDAR data collected by the NOAA California Coastal Conservancy Coastal Topobathy Project: Digital Elevation Model 2009-2011.For bathymetry at Pt. Mugu, we used data collected by the Seafloor Mapping Lab (SFML) at the California State University Monterey Bay (Seafloor Mapping Lab, 2013). Side scan data for Pt. Mugu were acquired using a Swathplus interferometric sonar with an Applanix Position and Orientation System, Marine Vessel (POS MV 320 v.4) system (position accuracy \u00b1 2 m, pitch, roll and heading accuracy \u00b1 0.02\u00b0, heave accuracy \u00b1 5% or 5 cm). Bathymetric data were post-processed using CARIS HIPS hydrographic data cleaning system software. Derived products are at 1m resolution and relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum with geoid09. Data acquisition, post-processing, and final products derived from multibeam bathymetry data were handled by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at CSUMB. We synthesized the bathymetry data to create a DEM of the mudflat and subtidal regions at Mad River, San Pablo, Bolinas, Morro, Pt. Mugu, and Newport using ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013, Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size). We removed portions of bathymetry data that overlapped with elevation surveys conducted on the marsh. In this report we present elevation data as local orthometric heights (NAVD88). \u2003 At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services.

topography of the tidal marshes we conducted survey-grade elevation surveys at all sites between 2009 and 2013 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK)Global Positioning System (GPS) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS).

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Mad River Slough marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2070 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "item_url":

At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS).

GPS Viva rover, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat (Bass Hunter, Cabelas, Sidney, NE; Figure 7). The RTK GPS obtained high resolution elevations of the water surface (reported precision 10 cm water depth. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. We suspended the bar-check plate below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. Morro Bay did not have bathymetry data, therefore we downloaded LIDAR data collected by the NOAA California Coastal Conservancy Coastal Topobathy Project: Digital Elevation Model 2009-2011.For bathymetry at Pt. Mugu, we used data collected by the Seafloor Mapping Lab (SFML) at the California State University Monterey Bay (Seafloor Mapping Lab, 2013). Side scan data for Pt. Mugu were acquired using a Swathplus interferometric sonar with an Applanix Position and Orientation System, Marine Vessel (POS MV 320 v.4) system (position accuracy \u00b1 2 m, pitch, roll and heading accuracy \u00b1 0.02\u00b0, heave accuracy \u00b1 5% or 5 cm). Bathymetric data were post-processed using CARIS HIPS hydrographic data cleaning system software. Derived products are at 1m resolution and relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum with geoid09. Data acquisition, post-processing, and final products derived from multibeam bathymetry data were handled by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at CSUMB. We synthesized the bathymetry data to create a DEM of the mudflat and subtidal regions at Mad River, San Pablo, Bolinas, Morro, Pt. Mugu, and Newport using ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013, Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size). We removed portions of bathymetry data that overlapped with elevation surveys conducted on the marsh.

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast.

We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and

topography of the tidal marshes we conducted survey-grade elevation surveys at all sites between 2009 and 2013 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK)Global Positioning System (GPS) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses in this study including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones.

cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al., 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Pt. Mugu Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "item_url":

(Swanson et al., 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Bolinas Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services.

The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Morro Bay Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "item_url":

conducted survey-grade elevation surveys at all sites between 2009 and 2013 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK)Global Positioning System (GPS) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses in this study including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones.

GPS Viva rover, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat (Bass Hunter, Cabelas, Sidney, NE; Figure 7). The RTK GPS obtained high resolution elevations of the water surface (reported precision 10 cm water depth. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. We suspended the bar-check plate below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. Morro Bay did not have bathymetry data, therefore we downloaded LIDAR data collected by the NOAA California Coastal Conservancy Coastal Topobathy Project: Digital Elevation Model 2009-2011.For bathymetry at Pt. Mugu, we used data collected by the Seafloor Mapping Lab (SFML) at the California State University Monterey Bay (Seafloor Mapping Lab, 2013). Side scan data for Pt. Mugu were acquired using a Swathplus interferometric sonar with an Applanix Position and Orientation System, Marine Vessel (POS MV 320 v.4) system (position accuracy \u00b1 2 m, pitch, roll and heading accuracy \u00b1 0.02\u00b0, heave accuracy \u00b1 5% or 5 cm). Bathymetric data were post-processed using CARIS HIPS hydrographic data cleaning system software. Derived products are at 1m resolution and relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum with geoid09. Data acquisition, post-processing, and final products derived from multibeam bathymetry data were handled by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at CSUMB.

cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al., 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Tijuana Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "item_url":

vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS).

cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al., 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Pt. Mugu Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "item_url":

(Swanson et al., 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant.

We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Newport Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "item_url":

summer and winter habitats, that are often strongly controlled by changes in environmental conditions, including climate. Because species interact, shifts in one species\u2019 phenology can have cascading effects throughout entire food webs and ecosystems. Recent advances have helped grow the body of literature surrounding phenology. We now know, for example, that invasive species often show greater flexibility in the timing of their phenological events, enabling them to outcompete native species as climate and environmental conditions change.  Natural resource managers recognize that changes in phenology can substantially affect their management activities. Phenological information can be used to identify when to survey for or treat invasive insects or plants, when to apply prescribed fire to maintain habitat, or when to prepare for peak tourist seasons in national parks. However, managers on-the-ground are often uncertain about how to best incorporate this information into their management practices.  With a focus on the Southwest U.S., this project will connect scientists and natural resource managers to ensure that managers are getting the right phenological information, in the right format, at the right time. Through a series of workshops, scientists with the USA National Phenology Network, the USGS, and universities will connect with resource managers from federal and state land management agencies, tribes, and private landholders to identify key decisions that would immediately benefit from phenological information. Through this engagement process, targeted products will be developed to address stakeholder-identified needs. Such products might include maps projecting green up of invasive plant species, such as buffelgrass, to inform the timing of the application of control treatments.

(2013a). In this case the evergreen needleleaf life form corresponds to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). For the eastern NGP we recalibrated MC1 so that the evergreen needleleaf lifeform corresponds to juniper; principally eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), but also to Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopularum), which is present in the western and central NGP.

Our lack of knowledge regarding the status results from the common belief that inland fishery harvests are widely under reported (FAO 2009; Welcomme et al. 2010), particularly the contributions from recreational, artisanal, and illegal fisheries (FAO 2003; Allan et al. 2005). Overcoming this knowledge gap has no simple solution, given that resources to conduct on-the-ground fisheries assessments are lacking throughout much of the world, particularly in Africa or Asia where the majority of the inland fisheries harvest for subsistence and commercial purposes occurs (FAO 2003). At the local level, the lack of reliable data on the status of fish populations constrains the ability of managers to intervene when fisheries are in decline, until the system has virtually collapsed. It is worth reemphasizing that sustainable inland fisheries are essential in the battle towards poverty eradication and improved nutrition in many of the least developed countries, and that poverty eradication is one of the key Millennium Development Goals set forth by the United Nations. Inland systems also will be vulnerable to changes in climate and land use in the coming century (Ficke et al. 2007; Brander 2007), and knowledge gaps in status and function of inland fisheries will exacerbate the inability of managers to mitigate climate-induced changes in fish populations. Relative to marine systems, habitats in inland systems will likely be more influenced by changes in precipitation patterns (and water levels) and thermal structure, and landlocked inland fish species likely have less ability to migrate to optimal water temperatures.   This project aimed to develop tools to narrow existing knowledge gaps on the status and key drivers of inland fisheries, given their importance in providing food and a means for poverty alleviation for people in developing countries and in driving economies in developed countries. By providing models that provide potentially less biased estimates of fish production as well as some key variables that could predict fish production, managers would have better information to both manage these key fisheries and their allied ecosystems presently and prepare for the effective governance of these resources in the face of future local and global climate, land and water induced changes.", "proj_phrases": ["ficke et al.", "local level", "fish production", "allan et al.", "inland fisheries harvest", "welcomme", "conduct on-the-ground fisheries assessments", "key millennium development goals", "thermal structure", "brander", "effective governance", "united nations", "knowledge gap", "inland fisheries exists", "allan", "beard et al.", "africa", "common belief", "key variables", "knowledge gaps", "key drivers", "reliable data", "fish populations", "commercial purposes occurs", "status results", "inland fish species", "overcoming", "beard", "asia", "ecosystem services", "key fisheries", "inland systems", "land use", "global climate", "inland fisheries", "fish species likely", "goals", "sustainable inland fisheries", "inland fishery harvests", "simple solution", "fao", "brander 2007", "marine systems", "optimal water temperatures", "illegal fisheries", "millennium", "precipitation patterns", "water levels", "welcomme et al.", "comprehensive understanding", "important effects", "poverty alleviation", "ficke", "relative", "fish populations constrains", "poverty eradication", "inland"], "num_items": 0, "avg_item_sim": 0, "proj_items": {}}, "55e01730e4b0f42e3d040dce": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55e01730e4b0f42e3d040dce", "proj_summary": "The Integrated Scenarios of the Future Northwest Environment project (an FY2012 NW CSC funded project), resulted in several datasets describing projected changes in climate, hydrology and vegetation for the 21st century over the Northwestern US.

Addressing these gaps in information regarding permafrost characteristics and dynamics, and what these changes will mean for human communities and ecosystems, will support management and planning efforts.   This project seeks to address these gaps through several mechanisms. First researchers have synthesized available information on the impacts of thawing permafrost on infrastructure and ecosystem services. The synthesis on permafrost and infrastructure highlights the need to better integrate data on current and future environmental conditions by bringing together engineers and scientists. The synthesis on ecosystem services, meanwhile, highlights the fact that permafrost is a critical landscape feature that supports drinking water availability, access to hunting and harvest areas, and fish and wildlife habitat.   A second component of this project has focused on synthesizing the distribution of surface water in the northern hemisphere in comparison to permafrost characteristics - such as permafrost extent, ground temperature, and thermokarst occurrence.

These trees currently face multiple threats, including attack by the mountain pine beetle, which has recently killed whitebark pines over much of the western U.S. Climate is an important factor in these outbreaks, and future warming is expected to affect epidemics. Our project developed statistical models of outbreaks in whitebark pine for three regions: the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Northern U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the Cascade Range. We used these models to understand climate/beetle outbreak relationships, evaluate climatic causes of recent outbreaks, and estimate the potential for future outbreaks given projections of climate change. The models fit the observations well, indicating confidence in their reliability. Climate influenced mountain pine beetle outbreaks through fall and winter temperatures, which are direct effects on beetles, as well as via reduced summer precipitation which increases drought stress on trees. Recent outbreaks were caused by warming and drought in the early 2000s. We found that, compared with a baseline of 1985-1994 when little beetle activity occurred, future climate will be more favorable for mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, our preliminary results indicate that some projections were similar to or exceed the climate favorability of conditions during the recent severe and extensive outbreak (2000-2009). Variability existed among outbreak projections as a result of the amount of future warming and changes in precipitation, which are functions of climate model, emissions scenario, and decade. Our project provides evidence of the importance of climate for influencing recent and future beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine forests. We recommend that land managers and decision makers consider the impacts of expected climate change on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine when planning conservation actions.

Key to a fish finding and using these different habitats is the connectivity between them. Changing conditions in the future, including increased air and water temperatures, are expected to impact many fish populations, as well as the rivers, streams, and habitats where they\u2019re found.  This project, jointly funded by the Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative, focused on the Methow River Basin in the arid east-central part of Washington State. The project team used data on fish growth, distribution, movement, food webs, river flow, and water temperature to develop a bioenergetics model and provide a complete picture of the habitat needs for bull trout. It also demonstrated that habitat connectivity is highly important for bull trout. The study showed that mountain whitefish in the Methow River moved up to 185 km from their natal stream areas, similar to the scale documented for bull trout. These large-scale movements are considered extremely important for diversity and resilience to environmental change. Loss of connectivity will be an increasing concern with rising stream temperatures and altered streamflows, and the project suggests that climate change impacts can be expected to affect major aspects of fish life.

These animals play vital roles in the boreal forest ecosystem, are a source of pleasure for bird and wildlife watchers, and contribute to tourism revenue for many communities. However, moose and migratory birds are thought to be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. For example, in New York\u2019s Adirondack Park system, five species of boreal birds have shown occupancy declines of 15% or more. Meanwhile, moose are threatened by winter ticks that thrive in warmer climates and spread disease. A 2018 New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYDEC) report found that there are approximately 400 moose in the Adirondacks, which is down from previous estimates of 600-1,200 moose.  Building upon earlier work related to moose populations and management, this project will continue to develop climate scenarios for moose management. Researchers will then apply these scenarios to moose management options developed by NYDEC managers. Additionally, they will identify climate change impacts to bird communities in the Adirondacks and neighboring boreal ecosystems, and use existing research to describe the causes of decline in resident and migratory boreal bird species. The project will also convene resource managers, state agencies, and NGOs to present results of long-term bird community analyses, and discuss best management practices in light of future plausible scenarios of change in boreal bird communities and habitat. Finally, this project will explore how a changing climate may create opportunities for birds from areas further south and lower in elevation as they move into Adirondack Park.  By examining impacts to moose and bird communities, this project will allow managers to contrast climate change impacts and adaptation options facing the boreal-dependent moose, which are able to thrive on a wide variety of food resources, compared to boreal birds, which have a more limited diet.

To make matters worse, it is also expected to shift the range of many species, forcing animals capable of adapting by moving to expand into new areas to find more suitable temperatures and adequate food supplies \u2013 a challenge made difficult, if not impossible, by disconnected landscapes. Maintaining connectivity between habitats is a key strategy for conserving wildlife populations into the future, and sound science is needed to inform conservation decisions.  Scientists with the SE CSC, in partnership with the South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative, assessed current and projected connectivity for three species that inhabit bottomland hardwood forests, a habitat of high conservation concern: American black bear, Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bat, and timber rattlesnake. Not surprisingly, the study results suggest that under anticipated climate conditions, there will be fewer connections for species to move between suitable habitats.  Moreover, the findings reveal that the connectedness of a future landscape will be species specific. For example, what may be sufficiently connected for a black bear to easily traverse long distances might well prove to be disconnected for a rattlesnake. This suggests a limited ability for managers to use the \u201cumbrella species\u201d concept to make generalized management decisions. The team additionally found that connectivity projections differ based on the model and method being used. Researchers suggest that managers and others use multiple techniques and focus on multiple species to get a more holistic, accurate representation of how species will use a particular landscape in the future and how connections between and among habitats can be strengthened most effectively.

The team will then convene researchers, managers, subject-matter experts, and climate change adaptation specialists at a participatory climate change scenario planning workshop to develop a small set (3-5) of challenging, plausible, relevant, and divergent future scenarios that qualitatively assess how grazing resources and management at DINO may be affected under climate change. Concurrently, the process will identify common key characteristics that may be regionally applicable to BLCA and CURE, and will consider caveats for broader use at parks managing grazing in other regional biomes. Workshop participants will provide input on the project and process, identify quantitative information needs, and offer recommendations for streamlining the effort into a scalable, transferable approach that could be used to guide other park units seeking to update their own grazing management plans.    A potential second phase of this project would entail the development of a modeling approach to provide quantitative information to NPS units that allow livestock grazing. This task would leverage recent advances in our ability to model grazing activities to evaluate the effects of climate change and management actions on vegetation within a specific park unit.

We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100. We were able to develop good predictive models of how warming influences beneficial and pest insects for cities in the Southeast and across the east coast more generally. We were also able to predict how tree health will respond to these changes in insect communities. In addition, by comparing our results to those we garnered from herbarium specimens (many insects can be found on herbarium specimens) we could show that the effects of urban warming match those of climate change through time. In short, a subset of pests is likely to get far worse with warming and this effect is likely to be most pronounced in the Southeast.

Given the importance of rainfall for Hawaiian ecosystems and freshwater reserves, this project investigated past seasonal rainfall pattern and developed a statistical model to estimate future rainfall changes for the major islands. As a result of this research, high-resolution maps and data are now available that researchers can use to study potential impacts on endangered species, or use the rainfall changes as input in decision-support tools.This data product provides data files that present future climate change rainfall scenarios for the Hawaiian Islands. The data products are served in GIS compatible formats, text-based spreadsheet tables, and the scientific data format NetCDF. Furthermore, figure files in PDF format are part of the distribution. The data product contains information on future rainfall change scenarios for the main Hawaiian Islands (Kauai, Oahu, Maui Nui, and Hawaii) for two time periods in the 21st century 2041-2070 and 2071-2099. In addition, some information from the historical 19th to 20th century are provided. The statistical downscaling method worked with station rainfall data. Geospatial interpolation methods were applied to create spatially interpolated gridded maps and contour files for the main Hawaiian Islands. The rainfall anomaly maps are provided in different resolutions (3km, 250m, and 0.5 minute resolution in longitude and latitude). In addition to the anomaly maps, we included seasonal rainfall climatology maps as references (base maps). These base maps, which were obtained from the Rainfall Atlas of Hawaii products (Giambelluca et al., 2013; http://rainfall.geography.hawaii.edu/) are provided at 250m resolution. This data product contains spatially interpolated maps with information on the skill of the statistical downscaling method. These data files and maps serve as a guidance for the user, in which regions the downscaled rainfall scenarios come with lower or higher confidence. In addition the product provides maps in 3km resolution with statistics on the frequency of future rainfall anomalies in five distinct categories: very dry, dry, neutral, wet, very wet conditions (details are provided in the accompanying README file that is part of this distribution). Taken together, these spatially interpolated maps provide insight into the potential rainfall changes in Hawaii that can be expected under the future climate change scenarios of the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5).

While the tribe has adapted to non-\u00adclimatic stressors over the past century, climate change impacts to water resources pose a threat to the ecosystems and species of fish so deeply important to the PLPT. Our previous research indicates that PLPT is an exemplary leader in adaptive planning, given that tribal members are keenly aware of and concerned for climate change impacts to Pyramid Lake.

These phenological events are linked to weather and climate, and as temperature and precipitation patterns have changed, some spring events are occurring earlier. These changes in plant phenology can have cascading effects on wildlife such as elk, moose, and mule deer, which depend on plants for food. It\u2019s thought that the quality of forage available in the spring could play a critical role for these big game species, which need to replenish energy depleted during the winter, in order to survive and successfully reproduce. Climate change will alter plant phenology, which in turn is likely to effect when, where, and for how long big game species can access the best quality food.   In mountainous areas, spring green-up occurs in a wave, beginning first at lower elevations before reaching higher elevations. Thus, to extend the amount of time that individuals are exposed to the highest quality food, they should follow this wave of spring green-up. The goal of this project is to determine whether mule deer track the spring green-up of vegetation as they migrate from their low elevation winter range to their high elevation summer range. While it\u2019s been hypothesized that mule deer and other herbivores \u201csurf the green wave\u201d \u2013 or track spring green-up \u2013 the question remains as to whether this behavior occurs or is common among big game species. To answer this question, researchers are tracking the movements of mule deer in Wyoming and are matching the progression of the green wave using GPS telemetry and remote-sensing technology.   So far, researchers have found that migratory mule deer do in fact surf the green wave. This result indicates that migratory routes are more than just a link between seasonal ranges; rather, they represent an important source of high-quality vegetation that mule deer can access by carefully timing their movements during spring migration. This means that changes in plant phenology resulting from shifting climate conditions could pose a threat to big game species like mule deer, potentially altering the quality and quantity of forage obtained during migration.

The impacts of this warming on aquatic ecosystems are significant in many areas, causing problems for fisheries management, as many economically and ecologically important fish species are experiencing range shifts and population declines. Fisheries and natural resource managers need timely and usable data and tools in order to understand and predict changes to lakes and their biota.   A previous Northeast CSC-funded project modeled lake temperatures to help state agencies in the Midwest understand trends in walleye and largemouth bass populations and predict lake-specific fish populations under future climate scenarios. These results have been extremely valuable for decisions and management strategies at the state scale, and this new project will expand these efforts and will focus on lake temperature products at the three spatial scales of most interest to state agency stakeholders: lake, state, and region (for Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan).   The project researchers will use a \u201chyperscale\u201d modeling approach that will build upon the multi-state modeling framework developed in the earlier project to increase model accuracy for high priority managed lakes. This approach will use all observations of temperature that exist for every study lake in the region and use machine learning techniques to uncover biases in models used for lakes with many observations. The project will generate an improved assessment of aquatic habitat for lake fisheries, and will provide estimates of contemporary thermal habitats to be used by state partners to estimate the distribution and abundance of ecologically and economically important fish species.

Because individual species respond to climate change differently, some will be adversely affected by climate change whereas others may benefit. Successfully managing species in a changing climate will require an understanding of which species will be most and least impacted by climate change. Although several approaches have been proposed for assessing the vulnerability of species to climate change, it is unclear whether these approaches are likely to produce similar results. In this study, we compared the relative vulnerabilities to climate change of 76 species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and trees based on three different approaches to assessing vulnerability. We compared (1) projected shifts in species distributions to (2) an assessment based on expert opinion and projected changes in climate to (3) an approach based on the current and future climatic conditions within species\u2019 current ranges. We found that the three approaches provided substantially different rankings of the species. Some species were determined to be highly vulnerable by one approach but only moderately vulnerable by the other two approaches. Only one species, the caribou, was consistently ranked in the top ten most vulnerable species by all three approaches. This is not entirely surprising given that the three measures assess different aspects of vulnerability and are based on different types of information. Nonetheless, these results are important because they indicate that more than one approach may be needed to adequately assess vulnerability and that basing management decisions on one approach alone may lead scientists and managers to underestimate vulnerability.

In many parts of the world, this decrease in temperature is a limiting factor for vegetation\u2014at certain elevations, the temperature becomes too cold for plants to survive. However in the tropics, moisture availability may play a more important role than temperature in determining the altitude at which forests can grow. For example on Haleakal\u0101, a volcano on the Hawaiian Island of Maui, the forest line is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. Rather, the forest line is highest in the wetter eastern-most end and lower on the drier, western end of the volcano.   Research also suggests that short-duration extreme climate events that cause changes in moisture, such as El Ni\u00f1o, can control the upper limit of forests more than long-term average climate does. This is because species found at the forest line are often already near their physiological limits, so extreme changes can have a big effect on their survival.    A strong El Ni\u00f1o occurred in Hawai\u2019i in 2015 and provided researchers with a unique opportunity to observe how vegetation responds to ensuing climate variability. Researchers are focusing on Metrosideros polymorpha, a species of flowering evergreen native to Hawai\u2019i. This species is the dominant canopy tree found near the forest line and will be used as an indicator for how the forest line responds to El Ni\u00f1o-driven drought. Specifically, the objectives of this study are to: (1) Observe the climate and ecosystem processes at locations near and above the forest line on Haleakal\u0101 during an El Ni\u00f1o event. (2) Determine how the ecosystem responds to changes in climate, such as drought, caused by El Ni\u00f1o.

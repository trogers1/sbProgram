Estimates of extinction rates and population losses attributable to climatic change are often based on studies of modeled biogeographic distributions, which rely on simple relationships between present-day distributions of species and climate variables to estimate distributions of species under future climate. Hundreds of papers using distribution models - based almost exclusively on relationships between plants and climate - have been published. The predictions of these models undergird conservation plans, are used to forecast the magnitude of future extinctions, and to leverage efforts to produce policies aimed at mitigating the effects of climatic change. Remarkably few experimental manipulations of the effects of climatic change, and in particular temperature change, have been conducted on animal populations and communities or on ecological processes dependent on their dynamics. This project builds upon the longest-running, largest scale forest warming experiment in the world to synthetically consider the effects of warming on diverse taxonomic and functional groups, from fungi and bacteria to herbivores and plant pathogens.

Today, sea-level rise, more frequent and stronger storms, saltwater intrusion, and warming water temperatures are among the threats that are altering these important habitats.   To support future planning and conservation of California\u2019s near-shore habitats, researchers examined current weather patterns, elevations, tides, and sediments at these sites to see how they affect plants and animals.

At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses in this study including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services.

We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast.", "avg_sim":

is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Mad River Slough marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change.

We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "avg_sim":

topography of the tidal marshes we conducted survey-grade elevation surveys at all sites between 2009 and 2013 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK)Global Positioning System (GPS) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses in this study including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US.

We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and

is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Pt. Mugu Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services.

At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses in this study including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services.

When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS).

is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Pt. Mugu Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change.

{"item_summary": "All of these files are Microsoft Excel format files that contain Surface Elevation Table (SET) data. We installed deep rod surface elevation tables (SETs) to quantify the relative contributions of surface and subsurface processes to present-day elevation change (i.e., root growth, decomposition, compaction, water flux), shallow subsidence (accretion \u2013 elevation), and shallow subsidence between shallow (root zone) and deeper (to &gt;10 m) portions of the soil profile. We installed four SETs at each marsh site, following methods described by Cahoon et al. 2002 and Webb et al., 2013. We established two SETs in low marsh and two in high marsh at each site after visual assessment of vegetation composition and distance from tidal source. We deployed each SET with three feldspar marker horizon plots. When the SET instrument is attached to the installed bench mark, the SET provides a constant reference plane in space from which the distance to the sediment surface can be measured by means of pins lowered to the sediment surface. SET measurements will be taken by reading the heights of nine pins lowered to the sediment surface using the SET instrumentation at 4 directions, which are 90 degrees from each other. Repeated measurements of elevation can be made with high precision because the orientation of the table in space remains fixed for each sampling. We are conducting on-going measurements every three months at all sites. We installed surface elevation tables (SETs) at our seven study sites between September and December 2013 (n = 24) to evaluate present-day changes in marsh surface elevation. As of the time of this report, we collected two to seven baseline readings at each site (Figure 24; Table 12). Early results suggest that the magnitude of marsh surface elevation change varied within sites and between low and high tidal marsh. Net marsh surface elevation change was positive in both high and low marsh in Bolinas and Mad River. In contrast, surface elevation declined in high marsh locations at Morro, Pt. Mugu, San Pablo, and Tijuana. These initial findings should be considered inconclusive until several additional years of data have been collected. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Tijuana Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model.

Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Mad River Slough marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2070 with a 12 cm sea-level rise rate. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "avg_sim":

cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al., 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110.

survey-grade elevation surveys at all sites between 2009 and 2013 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK)Global Positioning System (GPS) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses in this study including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast.", "avg_sim":

We deployed 1-4 water level loggers and a single conductivity logger at all sites over the study period (Figure 6; Table 2). Primary water level loggers and conductivity loggers were deployed in major tidal channels connecting the marshes to the estuary. Secondary water level loggers were deployed in the upper reaches of second-order tidal channels to capture high tides and determine inundation patterns. Water level readings were collected every six minutes. We used data from the primary water level logger at each site to develop local hydrographs and inundation rates. Loggers were surveyed by RTK GPS at least once during the period of deployment. We corrected all raw water level data with local time series of barometric pressure using Solinst barometric loggers (Model 3001, Solinst Canada Ltd., Georgetown, Ontario, Canada), additional Hobo loggers (Model U-20-001-01-Ti, Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA, USA) or barometric pressure from local airports (distance less than 10 miles). We assessed salinity and water temperature in the tidal channels at each site with Odyssey conductivity/temperature loggers (Dataflow Systems Pty Limited, Christchurch, New Zealand), after an initial period of unsuccessful deployment of Hobo conductivity loggers (Model U-24-001, Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA, USA), that were recalled due to manufacture error and data inconsistencies. We converted specific conductance values obtained with the Odyssey loggers to practical salinity units (PSU) using the equation in UNESCO (1983). At Tijuana, we used salinity data from the National Estuarine Research Reserve System Centralized Data Management Office website, using the Boca Rio station (TJRBRWQ, 32.5595\u00b0 N latitude, -117.1288\u00b0 W longitude; cdmo.baruch.sc.edu). The water level data was used to estimate local tidal datums for all sites using procedures outlined in the NOAA Tidal Datums Handbook (NOAA 2003). Only local MHW and MHHW was calculated because the loggers were positioned in the intertidal and therefore could not be used to compute lower datums. Mean tide level (MTL) was estimated for each site by using NOAA\u2019s VDATUM model (v.3.4) at the location of the primary water level logger or at a nearby site in the estuary if the VDATUM model domain did not include the water level logger location. At Bolinas we used NOAA published values for MTL, MHW and MHHW; the station was located about 2km from the study site.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Newport Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "avg_sim":

survey-grade elevation surveys at all sites between 2009 and 2013 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK)Global Positioning System (GPS) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS).

is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Bolinas Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "avg_sim":

bathymetric surveys using a shallow-water echo-sounding system (Takekawa et al., 2010, Brand et al., 2012) comprised of an acoustic profiler (Navisound 210; Reson, Inc., Slangerup, Denmark), Leica RTK GPS Viva rover, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat (Bass Hunter, Cabelas, Sidney, NE; Figure 7). The RTK GPS obtained high resolution elevations of the water surface (reported precision 10 cm water depth. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. We suspended the bar-check plate below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. Morro Bay did not have bathymetry data, therefore we downloaded LIDAR data collected by the NOAA California Coastal Conservancy Coastal Topobathy Project: Digital Elevation Model 2009-2011.For bathymetry at Pt. Mugu, we used data collected by the Seafloor Mapping Lab (SFML) at the California State University Monterey Bay (Seafloor Mapping Lab, 2013). Side scan data for Pt. Mugu were acquired using a Swathplus interferometric sonar with an Applanix Position and Orientation System, Marine Vessel (POS MV 320 v.4) system (position accuracy \u00b1 2 m, pitch, roll and heading accuracy \u00b1 0.02\u00b0, heave accuracy \u00b1 5% or 5 cm). Bathymetric data were post-processed using CARIS HIPS hydrographic data cleaning system software. Derived products are at 1m resolution and relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum with geoid09. Data acquisition, post-processing, and final products derived from multibeam bathymetry data were handled by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at CSUMB. We synthesized the bathymetry data to create a DEM of the mudflat and subtidal regions at Mad River, San Pablo, Bolinas, Morro, Pt. Mugu, and Newport using ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013, Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size). We removed portions of bathymetry data that overlapped with elevation surveys conducted on the marsh. In this report we present elevation data as local orthometric heights (NAVD88). \u2003 At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and

Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Tijuana Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "avg_sim":

model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al., 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Morro Bay Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "avg_sim":

topography of the tidal marshes we conducted survey-grade elevation surveys at all sites between 2009 and 2013 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK)Global Positioning System (GPS) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS).

Bathymetric data were post-processed using CARIS HIPS hydrographic data cleaning system software. Derived products are at 1m resolution and relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum with geoid09. Data acquisition, post-processing, and final products derived from multibeam bathymetry data were handled by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at CSUMB.

Over 2,000 intertidal plots were sampled for plant cover, frequency of occurrence, and species richness across the six study sites. Approximately 57 vascular plant species were found in the study, including grasses, rushes, forbs and sedges. Vegetated marsh ranged in elevation from approximately local mean tide level (MTL) to the marsh-upland transition zone (upland plots, defined as areas estimated to flood 1 time per year on average, were not considered for further analysis). We assessed vegetation cover and species richness concurrently with elevation surveys at approximately 25% of the elevation points. We visually assessed percent cover of all plant species within a 0.25 m2 quadrat, and recorded the average and maximum height (measured to the nearest centimeter) of each species. Total plant cover in a plot could exceed 100% due to vegetation layering. Vascular plant nomenclature generally follows Baldwin et al. (2012). We used long-term (10 yr) NOAA tide data to assess inundation relationships with local elevation and thereby define the elevation limits of four intertidal habitat zones for evaluation of SLR impacts to marshes along the California coastline: low marsh, middle marsh, high marsh and transitional marsh. First, to determine region-specific relationships between elevation and inundation, we compiled data from all recorded high tides from 2004-2013 at three NOAA tidal stations along the US west coast: San Diego, San Francisco, and Charleston, Oregon (tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). Using these time series, we determined the percentage of high tides that reached a given elevation. We defined low marsh as all elevations between the lowest vegetation plot and the elevation reached by 50% of all recorded high tides (low marsh flooded at least once daily, on average). We defined middle marsh as habitat flooded by 50-25% of all high tides (flooding once every 1-2 days, on average), and high marsh as elevations flooded by 3-25% of all high tides (flooding at least twice per month, but less than once every other day, on average). We defined transition zone marsh as habitat flooded by 0.14-3% of all high tides (flooding at least once annually, but no more than twice per month, on average). Mudflat occurred between local mean-lower low water (MLLW) and the lowest extent of emergent tidal marsh vegetation; subtidal habitat occurred. Using the regional NOAA data, we determined the z* ranges that corresponded to the four marsh zones as defined above. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services.

Real Time Kinematic (RTK)Global Positioning System (GPS) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK network coverage (San Pablo, Petaluma, Pt. Mugu, and Newport), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Humboldt, Bolinas, Morro and Tijuana), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. When using the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning. We verified rover accuracy and precision by measuring positions at local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks and temporary benchmarks established at each site (Table 1). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-2 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. At each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects oriented perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines. We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid values (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 or zone 11 using Leica GeoOffice (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA, v. 7.0.1).We synthesized the elevation survey data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) at each site in ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013; Redlands, CA) with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 mcell size) after adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square error (RMS).

is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Newport Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model. At the state level, California has highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change.

Co-production, a process whereby scientists work closely with managers to identify and fill knowledge gaps, is an effective means of ensuring that science results will be directly useful to managers.   Through a multi-phase project, researchers are implementing co-production to identify how climate change might affect management decisions, what science is available to inform those decisions, and what gaps in climate information need to be filled, to support the management of species of conservation concern in the North Central region. In phase one of the project (still ongoing), researchers are working with state wildlife managers to identify species of conservation concern in the region - such as those that are of high regional priority for managers, candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act, or for which management decisions could be improved by more information on climate-related stressors and adaptation options.   In this second phase, one species will be selected from the list to pilot the development of a co-produced work plan for science and planning that will help incorporate climate information into management decisions about the target species.

In order to identify knowledge gaps and resource needs related to adaptation and resilience in coastal Alaska, the Alaska Climate Science Center partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association, and a dozen other entities to hold a series of workshops in communities across coastal Alaska in 2016. These workshops brought together resource managers, tribal leaders, community planners, and scientists from tribes, state agencies, and federal agencies, with the goal of advancing coastal resilience and adaptation across the region.   This project will build on the workshop series and will be a joint effort between the CSC, the Aleutian and Bering Sea Islands Landscape Conservation Cooperative, the Aleut International Association, and the National Park Service. This group work work together to (1) produce maps of key subsistence harvest areas and other important socioeconomic information in the Aleutian Islands; (2) engage local decision-makers to collect input on key information needs; and (3) support community-based monitoring efforts that contribute to adaptation in the region.

The multiple drivers that affect lake sport fisheries, along with the complex interactions within lakes, make it difficult to forecast changes in sport fisheries and plan adaptive responses to build resilience of these important resources. Resilience involves managing with an eye toward critical thresholds for behavior of ecosystems. Project researchers are working to develop quantitative tools for assessment of thresholds in sport fisheries that can be used by management agencies to evaluate potential impacts of climate change mediated through species and habitat interactions. Several outputs of the project will be adaptable to other assessments of resilience of sport fisheries, including bioenergetics and ecosystem models to assess thresholds; delineation of Thresholds of Concern for regional sport fisheries subject to changing climate, land use and angling effort; and assessments of the capacity of management tools to alter critical thresholds for sport fisheries. To focus the work, the research team is addressing thresholds for replacement of cool-water sport fish by warm-water sport fish, using the specific example of walleye and bass in the Upper Midwestern U.S. Climate change has obvious implications for transitions between thermal guilds, but details of species interactions, changes in nearshore habitat, invasive species, angler behavior, regulations or many other factors are likely to affect the thresholds for transition between cool and warm water fishes and we will address these complex interactions.

As temperatures warm, permafrost is thawing, with potentially adverse impacts to infrastructure, communities, and the structure and function of Arctic ecosystems. However, the processes leading to changes in permafrost are not well understood, and there is a need to better understand the vulnerability of permafrost to thaw. Addressing these gaps in information regarding permafrost characteristics and dynamics, and what these changes will mean for human communities and ecosystems, will support management and planning efforts.   This project seeks to address these gaps through several mechanisms. First researchers have synthesized available information on the impacts of thawing permafrost on infrastructure and ecosystem services. The synthesis on permafrost and infrastructure highlights the need to better integrate data on current and future environmental conditions by bringing together engineers and scientists. The synthesis on ecosystem services, meanwhile, highlights the fact that permafrost is a critical landscape feature that supports drinking water availability, access to hunting and harvest areas, and fish and wildlife habitat.   A second component of this project has focused on synthesizing the distribution of surface water in the northern hemisphere in comparison to permafrost characteristics - such as permafrost extent, ground temperature, and thermokarst occurrence. Researchers used Landsat satellite data to identify the locations of water on the landscape and understand areas that have transition from water to land, between 1985 and 2015.

In particular, ongoing UAF data stewardship activities include ensuring that AK CSC researchers comply with metadata standards, and verifying that final data and other associated research products are housed in approved, robust, and redundant repositories. This project seeks to further develop and augment these services by improving access to digital data resources by researchers, community members, and decision makers in Alaska.

They provide natural places for recreation, clean drinking water, and important habitats for fish and wildlife. However, the warmer temperatures and harsher droughts in the west that are related to climate change are causing die-offs of many trees. Outbreaks of insects, like the mountain pine beetle, that kill trees are also more likely in warmer, drier conditions.  To maintain healthy and functioning forest ecosystems, one action forest managers can take is to make management decisions that will help forests adapt to future climate change. However, adaptation is a process based on genetic change and few tools are currently available for managers to use to incorporate genetic information into management decision-making. Information is needed that links the responses of trees to environmental change and to develop genetic profiles of resistant trees. This information could then be used in screening for adaptive genetic traits and to assess genetic diversity.  This project will help gather that information through a pilot study focusing on mountain pine beetles and whitebark pine trees in western Montana. Researchers are investigating whether the current mountain pine beetle outbreak has resulted in the selection (survival and reproduction) of drought tolerant, and consequently, beetle resistant whitebark pines. They will examine tree core samples, tree resin, and pine needles to understand characteristics of the remaining forests and to collect DNA. From this work, the team expects to develop an easy and economical approach for screening whitebark pine trees for drought tolerance, beetle resistance, and genetic diversity that can be used in the conservation and restoration of this threatened, ecologically important high elevation tree, and other conifers experiencing climate-driven bark beetle outbreaks.

extracted from LANDFIRE Environmental Site Potential (ESP). Future time period data are from three global climate models (GCMs): CGCM, GFDL, and HadCM3. In MAXENT, we used the logistic output format (generating presence probabilities between 0 and 1), a random test percentage of 30 (using 70 % of the occurrence points to generate the suitability model and 30 % of the occurrence points to validate it), and a jackknife test to measure variable importance. We used a 10-fold cross-validation routine with repeated subsampling of occurrence points into random training and testing subsets. This generated 10 separate models plus an averaged model. The models trained on the reference period variables were then used to project future presence probabilities for each woody community type for each GCM and future time period. Values in the data sets are the jack-knifed average values and range from zero to one, with one representing highest environmental suitability for a given ESP type.

Crossing these thresholds could lead to rapid change or decline in the health of a wildlife population.  In response to this need, a team of researchers is working to identify the primary drivers (climate change vs. urban growth) of changes in the distribution of wildlife in the Northeast and examine potential changes in their distribution over time in order to identify possible biological thresholds that would significantly alter the biology and health of wildlife populations. The team will also determine how changing temperature and precipitation will influence wildlife interactions and tree and bird species, as well as examine how specific events, like extreme storms, may be correlated to biological thresholds. This project will focus on species of conservation concern in the Northeast and Midwest, including eastern tree species, songbirds, moose, Canada lynx, snowshoe hare, and southern pine beetle.

So too is identifying ways in which managers can better incorporate information on climate and the vulnerability of resources into their decision-making.   This project sought to improve decision-making in the North Central region by developing an approach to managing natural resources that acknowledges the uncertainties that exist and incorporates the adaptive capacity and vulnerability of resources to climate change. To meet this goal, researchers assessed (1) the key factors that affect the ability of human and ecological communities to adapt to climate change; (2) the current vulnerability of communities to changing conditions; and (3) the current risk assessment methodologies being used by managers in the region.

However in the tropics, moisture availability may play a more important role than temperature in determining the altitude at which forests can grow. For example on Haleakal\u0101, a volcano on the Hawaiian Island of Maui, the forest line is not found at the same elevation everywhere, as you would expect if it were controlled by temperature. Rather, the forest line is highest in the wetter eastern-most end and lower on the drier, western end of the volcano.   Research also suggests that short-duration extreme climate events that cause changes in moisture, such as El Ni\u00f1o, can control the upper limit of forests more than long-term average climate does. This is because species found at the forest line are often already near their physiological limits, so extreme changes can have a big effect on their survival.    A strong El Ni\u00f1o occurred in Hawai\u2019i in 2015 and provided researchers with a unique opportunity to observe how vegetation responds to ensuing climate variability.

In contrast, the Rio Grande basin is also affected by flood events that cause major losses to lives, properties, and economies.  Understanding each of these periods of water scarcity and water abundance can help water managers to design adaptation strategies that cope with these two extremes while still supporting human and environmental water management needs.  The overall goal of this project is to assess the climate variability of the southern branch of the Rio Grande basin and characterize the periods of historical drought and water abundance for 110 years [1900 \u2013 2010]. Results will help to understand extreme climatic events in the past to inform predictions of near future conditions of drought and floods. This study will also explore adaptation strategies relevant for agriculture, urban and rural communities, water management agencies, and environmental restoration to cope with extreme events.  This study addresses two chronic problems (droughts and floods) that have affected water users in the basin for the last 150 years and will continue to affect them in the future.

Cultural resources represent evidence of past human activity, such as archeological sites, or are of significance to a group of people traditionally associated with the resource, such as Native American ceremonial sites.   Climate change is challenging the long-term persistence of many cultural resources. For example, those located in coastal areas, such as historic lighthouses, are threatened by sea-level rise, shoreline erosion, and more frequent severe storm events. While climate change challenges managers of both natural and cultural resources to make decisions in the face of uncertainty, far less work has been done to identify the impacts of climate change on cultural resources, compared to natural resources.    To address this critical gap, researchers are developing a strategy to aid decision makers in climate adaptation planning efforts. The strategy integrates assessments of the relative significance of specific cultural resources and their vulnerability to climate change. The strategy will be pilot tested with a subset of buildings listed on the National Historic Register at Cape Look National Seashore, located on North Carolina\u2019s barrier islands.   Cultural resources hold multiple and diverse values to local communities, visitors, and the general public.

These transformations negatively impact people and ecosystems by reducing habitat quality for wildlife and the aesthetic value of the landscape.   Understanding how sagebrush communities are already responding and will continue to respond to changes in wildfire, invasive species, and climate is a priority for managers in the West. However, we currently know very little about how invasive grasses and fire will affect big sagebrush rangelands in the future and whether all big sagebrush ecosystems in the western U.S. will be negatively affected. In collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this project aims to fill this gap by assessing the vulnerability of sagebrush plant communities to future changes in climate, wildfire, and invasive grasses. To do this, researchers will predict sagebrush plant community responses to climate variability, wildfire-driven increases in invasive grasses,and grazing pressure at 200 sites across the West that are particularly important for the greater sage-grouse. They will then produce maps of what future sagebrush plant communities could look like by mid- and late-century for local and regional land and wildlife managers. Additionally, a web interface will be made available for managers to view this information, allowing them to access the data.

Questions remain, however, regarding the most effective and efficient methods for extending scientific knowledge and products into management and decision-making.  This study analyzes two unique cases of water management to better understand how science can be translated into resource management actions and decision-making.  In particular, this project seeks to understand 1) the characteristics that make science actionable and useful for water resource management and drought preparedness, and 2) the ideal types of scientific knowledge or science products that facilitate the use of science in management and decision-making.  The first case study focuses on beaver mimicry, an emerging nature-based solution that increases the presence of wood and woody debris in rivers and streams to mimic the actions of beavers. This technique has been rapidly adopted by natural resource managers as a way to restore riparian areas, increase groundwater infiltration, and slow surface water flow so that more water is available later in the year during hotter and dryer months. The second case study focuses on an established research program, Colorado Dust on Snow, that provides water managers with scientific information explaining how the movement of dust particles from the Colorado Plateau influences hydrology and the timing and intensity of snow melt and water runoff into critical water sources. This program has support from and is being used by several water conservation districts in the state.  Understanding how scientific knowledge translates into action and decision-making in these cases will strengthen our knowledge of actionable science in the context of drought and its impacts on ecosystems.

We evaluated climate responses of sagebrush using two approaches: (1) experimental manipulations of temperature and precipitation for natural plants in the field, and (2) assessment of how climate adaptation and weather have affected sagebrush seeding efforts on nearly 25 large-scale sagebrush seeding projects done over the past several decades. Experimental warming increased growth of sagebrush in high-elevation meadows in the Teton Mountains, but had marginal or no effect at lower elevations sites (near Twin Falls and Boise, Idaho, respectively). Increased precipitation enhanced sagebrush abundance, along with flowering and stem growth, particularly when added in winter on deep soils. In the post-fire seeding study, we found sagebrush abundances to be highly variable across different seeding projects, and the variation was partly related to the climate of seeding and seed-source sites and weather. Sagebrush seeds typically traveled hundreds of kilometers and nearly 1000 m downhill from seed source/origins to seeding sites, from sites with colder minimum temperatures than the seeding sites. Big sagebrush is comprised of subspecies that differ in their climate adaptation, and many seeding projects received a subspecies that differed from the native type requested by the land managers. These climate transfers appeared important to the success of seedings: successful seedings imported seeds from sites having the same minimum temperatures. In failed  seedings, seeds originated from relatively colder sites and, moreover, years with relatively warm minimum temperatures prevailed following planting. These results suggest minimum  temperature and winter precipitation responses are important factors in the climate adaptation and ecology of this desert shrub, and their consideration in climate vulnerability analyses and selection of seed sources is likely to improve land planning and restoration.

Materials will then be developed to communicate these uncertainties to managers and explore how they can be incorporated into risk decision-making.

Researchers with the North Central CSC and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provided climate science support to the Wyoming Basin REA. The Wyoming Basin REA is a landscape-scale ecological assessment of over 33 million acres in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Montana.

forests are an important habitat type for many wildlife species, including migratory birds and moose. These animals play vital roles in the boreal forest ecosystem, are a source of pleasure for bird and wildlife watchers, and contribute to tourism revenue for many communities. However, moose and migratory birds are thought to be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. For example, in New York\u2019s Adirondack Park system, five species of boreal birds have shown occupancy declines of 15% or more. Meanwhile, moose are threatened by winter ticks that thrive in warmer climates and spread disease. A 2018 New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYDEC) report found that there are approximately 400 moose in the Adirondacks, which is down from previous estimates of 600-1,200 moose.  Building upon earlier work related to moose populations and management, this project will continue to develop climate scenarios for moose management. Researchers will then apply these scenarios to moose management options developed by NYDEC managers. Additionally, they will identify climate change impacts to bird communities in the Adirondacks and neighboring boreal ecosystems, and use existing research to describe the causes of decline in resident and migratory boreal bird species. The project will also convene resource managers, state agencies, and NGOs to present results of long-term bird community analyses, and discuss best management practices in light of future plausible scenarios of change in boreal bird communities and habitat. Finally, this project will explore how a changing climate may create opportunities for birds from areas further south and lower in elevation as they move into Adirondack Park.  By examining impacts to moose and bird communities, this project will allow managers to contrast climate change impacts and adaptation options facing the boreal-dependent moose, which are able to thrive on a wide variety of food resources, compared to boreal birds, which have a more limited diet.

Caribou have also provided a traditional staple food source for native Alaskan communities. Moreover, caribou are important prey for wolves and bears and their health and population size impact the entire food web in the region.  The 2013 Arctic Report Card from NOAA reported declining populations of caribou throughout Alaska. Several possible mechanisms may be responsible for the declines, including changes in climate.  This project aimed to form a research consortium to bring together scientists and partners and to collaborate with two Alaskan Landscape Conservation Cooperatives with the goal of understanding the relationship between climate, vegetation, and caribou. The research conducted under this project used the relationship between climate and caribou as a focal point to identify and explore the connections between climate, movement of soil nutrients, plant quality for animal foraging, caribou dietary behavior, and herd dynamics for caribou in Alaska, Western Canada, and Svalbard.   Based on prior analyses, this project has now developed into an NSF-funded Central Arctic Caribou Herd program lead by Welker and colleagues from the University of Alaska - Anchorage, South Dakota State University, Colorado State University, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, University of Alaska - Fairbanks, University of Maryland/NASA and USGS. The focal work is continuing to seek understanding as to what are the nutritional tundra landscape traits, how do they vary seasonally, how do these nutritional and energetic landscapes correspond to caribou foraging behavior as well as questions of diet seasonality and how do conditions of the future effect forage quantity and quality using long-term tundra experiments. The consortium is part of the NASA ABoVE program as a partner project and the consortium is collaborating with the NSF NEON effort in Alaska as well.

At high elevations, headwater streams fared no better, with numerous streams experiencing periods of \u201cno flow\u201d for the first time in recorded history. These periods of low to no water flow can cause major water availability problems for wildlife and human communities, especially if they are not anticipated.  In order for land and resource managers to anticipate and prepare for future droughts, they need scientific information on water availability now and in the future at a landscape-scale and they need to know which headwater streams are particularly resilient to drought in order to place limited funds and resources into management of those streams. However, this scientific information is currently lacking and incomplete.  The objectives of this project are to: 1) develop a Headwaters Intermittency Prediction (HIP) tool that will provide managers with a prediction map of the expected permanence of water flows in streams; 2) utilize citizen-science techniques to gather steamflow data across the Northwest region; and 3) apply stream flow predictions to existing assessments of the vulnerability of aquatic species, such as the native bull trout, redband trout, and Lahontan cutthroat trout.

Confidence interval rasters indicate the value above or below the threshold corresponding to the nth percentile of confidence that the pixel is wet (above) or dry (below). Raw streamflow permanence probabilities were produced by the PRObability of Streamflow PERmanence (PROSPER) model, a GIS raster-based empirical model of probabilistic predictions of a stream channel having year-round flow for any unregulated and minimally-impaired stream channel in the Pacific Northwest region, U.S. The model provides predictions of annual streamflow permanence probabilities at a 30-m spatial resolution based on monthly or annually updated values of climatic conditions and static physiographic variables associated with the upstream basin. Predictions correspond to pixels on the channel network consistent with the medium resolution National Hydrography Dataset channel network stream grid.

Climate change will likely alter rainfall timing and intensity, but global climate models cannot capture the fine-scale dynamics of local rainfall, making future rainfall predictions for the islands uncertain. For this project, scientists used a technique called statistical downscaling (combining coarse-scale climate models with local historical data) to generate high-resolution maps showing seasonal rainfall change projections for Hawai\u02bbi over the course of this century. Results suggest that Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s climate will become drier overall in the second half of the century, but this effect will vary considerably across the islands and by season. There may be an increasing contrast between wet and dry regions on each island, as wet areas become wetter and dry areas become drier. The maps and findings produced by this project offer critical information for resource managers as they undertake adaptation and water management planning. They also provide a foundation for further ecological research, such as exploring the impacts of climate change on native Hawaiian plants and animals.

Given the importance of rainfall for Hawaiian ecosystems and freshwater reserves, this project investigated past seasonal rainfall pattern and developed a statistical model to estimate future rainfall changes for the major islands. As a result of this research, high-resolution maps and data are now available that researchers can use to study potential impacts on endangered species, or use the rainfall changes as input in decision-support tools.This data product provides data files that present future climate change rainfall scenarios for the Hawaiian Islands. The data products are served in GIS compatible formats, text-based spreadsheet tables, and the scientific data format NetCDF. Furthermore, figure files in PDF format are part of the distribution. The data product contains information on future rainfall change scenarios for the main Hawaiian Islands (Kauai, Oahu, Maui Nui, and Hawaii) for two time periods in the 21st century 2041-2070 and 2071-2099. In addition, some information from the historical 19th to 20th century are provided. The statistical downscaling method worked with station rainfall data. Geospatial interpolation methods were applied to create spatially interpolated gridded maps and contour files for the main Hawaiian Islands. The rainfall anomaly maps are provided in different resolutions (3km, 250m, and 0.5 minute resolution in longitude and latitude). In addition to the anomaly maps, we included seasonal rainfall climatology maps as references (base maps). These base maps, which were obtained from the Rainfall Atlas of Hawaii products (Giambelluca et al., 2013; http://rainfall.geography.hawaii.edu/) are provided at 250m resolution. This data product contains spatially interpolated maps with information on the skill of the statistical downscaling method. These data files and maps serve as a guidance for the user, in which regions the downscaled rainfall scenarios come with lower or higher confidence. In addition the product provides maps in 3km resolution with statistics on the frequency of future rainfall anomalies in five distinct categories: very dry, dry, neutral, wet, very wet conditions (details are provided in the accompanying README file that is part of this distribution). Taken together, these spatially interpolated maps provide insight into the potential rainfall changes in Hawaii that can be expected under the future climate change scenarios of the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Users of this data product are referred to compare these results to a related dynamical downscaling climate change project - https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/50118ddce4b0d78fd4e59ba3 . The purpose of this information is to provide a publicly available data product that can be used by scientists and researchers for studying the potential regional impacts of climate change for the Hawaiian Islands.

University of Missouri and Iowa State University, this project advanced efforts to understand and accommodate uncertainty by applying to Missouri River sturgeon population dynamics the tools of multi-scale climate models and hierarchical Bayesian modeling frameworks, linking models for system components together by formal rules of probability. While a complete climate prediction may be intractable at this time -- for instance, the climate projections may not incorporate land use changes and solar fluctuations into the boundary conditions -- we proposed a framework to quantify known uncertainty that is also flexible enough to adapt to advances in climate predictions. A key advantage of the hierarchical approach is that it incorporates various sources of observations and includes established scientific knowledge, and uncertainties associated with each. This work is critical for monitoring effects of climate change since lakes and streams have been identified as sentinels of environmental change. The proposed hierarchical modeling approach should help to account for these uncertainties, in particular variability of relevant climate conditions across temporal and spatial scales, so forecasts of community or population response to a given climate change scenario include realistic measures of uncertainty. The approach combined available data from numerous agencies (e.g., US Geological Survey, US Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service) and models (e.g., North American Regional Climate Change Program and sturgeon population, movement, and bioenergetics model) across a variety of scales. This work provides the framework for describing the potential consequences of global climate changes on large riverine ecosystems, alerting decision-makers to the most likely consequences, and producing a new suite of indicators of large riverine ecosystem change and health. The project also provides explicit means for scaling results up or down multiple hierarchical levels and associated uncertainty. The goal was to evaluate the potential distributional changes in an ecological system, given distributional changes implied by a series of linked climate and system models under various emissions/use scenarios for evaluation of management options for coping with global change consequences and a powerful tool for assessing uncertainty of those evaluations.

Through this project, scientists sought to better understand how native and non-native forests in Hawai\u02bbi will respond to climate change. Researchers used field data from two long-term monitoring sites in Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park to model the effects of projected climate change on two forest ecosystems, one dominated by the native \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba tree and the other by the invasive strawberry guava tree.  Results indicate that both forest types will need more water in the future and may experience decreased growth. Although slower growth of invasive species could be considered a benefit, the predicted decrease in \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba growth might signal a reduction in overall health and stability that could be disastrous to native forests and the services they provide. These findings can aid landowners as they anticipate and manage changes to forest communities. In addition, water resource managers may wish to consider the predicted increase in forest water use when developing future plans, as this may result in changes to groundwater recharge rates and stream flows.

Understanding the multiple factors that cause extreme wildfire events is critical to short and long-term forecasting and planning. Seasonal climate measures such as temperature and precipitation are commonly used to explain fire occurrence and impact. However, weather events that produce extreme winds and severe temperatures over short periods of time can also have substantial impacts on fire behavior. In addition, multi-year droughts may increase fire potential by decreasing the amount of moisture in vegetation.   The goal of this project is to investigate the range of factors that may explain the variation in annual fire activity in both forested and non-forested landscapes in California. These factors will include the longer-term effects of extended droughts and the shorter-term effects of intense heat spells, low relative humidity, and extreme winds. In addition, researchers will evaluate the extent to which large fires are associated with particular fire ignition sources. Results should inform improved predictive models to show how long-term drought events and short-term extreme weather could impact future fire activity.   This project will evaluate the relative importance of these environmental factors over the last several decades, across different landscape types in California. Results will provide predictive tools for fire managers, enabling them to better anticipate extreme fire events and update fire-danger warnings. In the long-term, these results can also be used to inform efforts to understand possible changes in the probability of fire in California.", "proj_items": {}, "num_items": 0}, "594aa2bce4b062508e36f45a": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/594aa2bce4b062508e36f45a", "proj_phrases": ["choctaw nations", "normal flow conditions", "severe drought", "vulnerable communities", "local scale", "numerical models", "possible climate", "environmental implications", "sole source", "previous project", "long range planning", "oklahoma", "water demand supply projections", "oklahoma drying", "red river watershed", "usgs", "water resources", "choctaw", "possible climate change scenarios", "water demand", "chickasaw", "red river", "previous study", "fish populations \u2013", "watershed-wide estimates", "specific communities", "climate change", "water uncertainty", "water bodies", "previously", "future water availability", "future impacts"], "avg_item_sim": 0, "proj_summary": "During the severe drought of 2010-2015, several communities in southeast Oklahoma almost ran out of water.

The SAMBI DSL project used predicted urban growth models described herein to inform future landscape conditions that were also based climate change impacts and vegetative community succession. These future landscape conditions were then applied as a context for land use and management decisions in conservation planning.  SLEUTH, named for the model input datasets (Slope, Land use, Excluded, Urban, Transportation and Hillshade) is the evolutionary product of the Clarke Urban Growth Model that uses cellular automata, terrain mapping and land cover change modeling to address urban growth (Jantz et al, 2009; NCGIA 2011). SLEUTH provides urban growth projections which are useful across a range of applications; including wildlife habitat analysis, conservation planning, and land cover dynamics analysis. SLEUTH incorporates four growth rules (Spontaneous Growth, New Spreading Centers, Edge Growth and Road-Influenced Growth) to model the rate and pattern of urbanization. The model simulates not only outward growth of existing urban areas, but also growth along transportation corridors and new centers of urbanization. SLEUTH incorporates five parameters (Dispersion, Breed, Spread, Slope and Road Gravity) into the growth rules which project future urbanization. Possible parameter coefficient values range between 1 and 100. During calibration every possible combination of these five parameter coefficients (between defined start and stop values and by a defined step size) is applied to the growth rules, in order to find the combination that best matches past urbanization patterns observed in the training data. Once found, the model is run in prediction mode using these parameter values in the growth rules. The model produces one urban growth cycle per year.

Currently there exist competing objectives for the management of these systems, including the desire to preserve pinyon-juniper viability as climate conditions continue to shift, as well as the need to track these systems to ensure their ranges do not expand into historically non-forested areas.

Hawaiian nearshore reefs generate about $800 million in annual revenue, not including the ecosystem services they provide - such as critical habitat for diverse fish species and buffering coasts from storm surges. The Hawaiian economy depends on healthy coral ecosystems, yet reefs are currently facing multiple threats, including changing climate conditions, local land-based pollution, and sediment erosion.  Erosion of soils into nearshore coastal zones is a chief concern facing land managers in West Maui. Intermittent rainfall can carry sediment from sources such as dirt roads, agricultural fields, streambanks, and disturbed forests into estuaries and the ocean. These sediments can block light that corals need for photosynthesis, essentially smothering them. Sediment also affects coastal user enjoyment by reducing water quality.  The goal of this project was to map, monitor, and analyze recent and historic rainfall to estimate sources of sediment for watersheds in West Maui. Researchers described how much sediment was entering the water from different land-based sources, to create a sediment budget for two watersheds in West Maui. Researchers found that current sediment deposition into coastal waters is likely due to the erosion of streambank terraces located downstream of former agricultural fields. These terraces are remnants of old agricultural land management practices in which soil and rock waste were pushed from fields into streams. It\u2019s estimated that this source results in over 90 dump truck loads of fine sediment entering West Maui\u2019s nearshore environment each year.

Sources of erosion include unimproved roads, fallow and active agricultural fields, disturbed forests, local development, and streambanks. This is the primary output dataset from this project, which mapped bank erosion hotspots, constructed a reconnaissance sediment budget for the West Maui watersheds, and constructed a calibrated decision-support model capable of estimating sediment reduction from management actions.   Mapping, field experiments, and analysis of recent and historic rainfall were used to estimate sources of land-based pollution for watersheds in West Maui, Hawaii, and UH translated these findings into a calibrated Bayesian Belief Network Model that estimates spatially explicit erosion under a range of scenarios and management alternatives.  An overall sediment budget was constructed for the watersheds, describing the proportion of sediment coming from each source. A sediment budget (see Dietrich and Dunne, 1978) is a table of sediment loads, typically arranged by geomorphic process, enabling users to focus mitigation on sediment sources about which they expect to be most concerned.  Findings from this field assessment were used to inform a decision-support model.

The risks of significant negative impacts are likely to be higher in these island systems than in many temperate regions of the world because of the limited size of their land masses, high numbers of species that only exist in narrowly defined regions, and expectations that tropical environments will experience greater changes in temperature. Tropical island communities are faced with making important decisions related to adaptation that could impact the health of important natural resources and ecosystems. However, a lack of scientific guidance and information complicates these efforts.  To help address this problem, the SE CSC project team will work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PRDNER), University of Puerto Rico, and North Carolina State University (NCSU) on improving the application of downscaled climate projections to help advance the recovery and conservation of amphibians in Puerto Rico. The USFWS and PRDNER seek to implement an adaptive conservation strategy to achieve recovery of three endangered frog species (of the genus Eleutherodactylus) and prevent federal listing of 14 other amphibians considered at risk. Implementation of the strategy requires identifying suitable habitat for the species at present and in the future, and ensuring the availability of field-tested protocols for locally supplementing, introducing, and translocating species as necessary.  The main objectives of this project are: (1) to develop an understanding of the eco-physiological limits of these species and the influence of those limits on extinction rates in local patches (i.e., heterogeneous micro-habitats within an ecosystem), and (2) to assess their adaptive capacity (i.e. the ability of the amphibians to adapt to changing environmental conditions). This will inform implementation of the conservation strategy, which is partly constrained by the availability of conservation areas that meet required eco-physiological conditions. This research will contribute to a decision framework developed by NCSU scientists that can assist decision makers in determining when and where to implement conservation actions to maximize species persistence.  The framework incorporates ecological and socio-economic factors, multiple and possibly competing management objectives, and key uncertainties (related to climate and land use dynamics) in determining potential conservation strategies.  This project will incorporate results from an earlier SE CSC project, Modeling Future Temperature and Precipitation for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Caribbean, that laid the foundation for more reliable climate change information for this region by producing dynamically downscaled climate projections.

These phenological events are linked to weather and climate, and as temperature and precipitation patterns have changed, some spring events are occurring earlier. These changes in plant phenology can have cascading effects on wildlife such as elk, moose, and mule deer, which depend on plants for food. It\u2019s thought that the quality of forage available in the spring could play a critical role for these big game species, which need to replenish energy depleted during the winter, in order to survive and successfully reproduce. Climate change will alter plant phenology, which in turn is likely to effect when, where, and for how long big game species can access the best quality food.   In mountainous areas, spring green-up occurs in a wave, beginning first at lower elevations before reaching higher elevations. Thus, to extend the amount of time that individuals are exposed to the highest quality food, they should follow this wave of spring green-up. The goal of this project is to determine whether mule deer track the spring green-up of vegetation as they migrate from their low elevation winter range to their high elevation summer range. While it\u2019s been hypothesized that mule deer and other herbivores \u201csurf the green wave\u201d \u2013 or track spring green-up \u2013 the question remains as to whether this behavior occurs or is common among big game species. To answer this question, researchers are tracking the movements of mule deer in Wyoming and are matching the progression of the green wave using GPS telemetry and remote-sensing technology.   So far, researchers have found that migratory mule deer do in fact surf the green wave. This result indicates that migratory routes are more than just a link between seasonal ranges; rather, they represent an important source of high-quality vegetation that mule deer can access by carefully timing their movements during spring migration. This means that changes in plant phenology resulting from shifting climate conditions could pose a threat to big game species like mule deer, potentially altering the quality and quantity of forage obtained during migration.

Our forecasts for the North Atlantic region indicated tree abundances were affected first by succession and harvest but second by climate. We predicted an increase in Southern and Central Hardwood species and a decrease in Northern Hardwood and spruce-fir forest species under warming climates over the next 300 years. Our comparison of the three modeling approaches across the eastern U.S. indicated high agreement for many species, especially northern species modeled to lose habitat in coming decades. There was agreement among models for decreases in black spruce, balsam fir, northern white cedar, and red spruce, and increases in loblolly pine and some oaks and hickories. Agreement across different modeling approaches and different climate scenarios provides strong evidence of potentially important changes to forests in response to climate change. These results can be used to guide decisions about how to manage forests under climate change to continue to provide the benefits we derive from them.

Succession, harvest, and climate are potentially important factors affecting forest composition and structure in the region. The goal of this project was to predict the distribution and abundance of dominant tree species across portions of the Eastern U.S. under alternative climate scenarios from present to the end of the century. We used the forest landscape change LANDIS PRO and hybrid empirical-physiological ecosystem model LINKAGES to model changes in forest biomass and species abundances and distribution in the North Atlantic region of the U.S. while accounting for climate change, succession, and harvest. Three climate scenarios were considered, defined by a general circulation model and emission scenario: PCM B1, CGCM A2, and GFDL A1FI. We then compared results from three alternative modeling approaches; LANDIS PRO, LINKAGES, and TreeAtlas for the Central Hardwood, Central Appalachian, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regions to determine agreement among models and establish a stronger inference for projected changes through model averaging. Tree Atlas is a statistically derived enhanced niche model in contrast to the process driven ecosystem and landscape models LINKAGES and LANDIS PRO.

comprehensive understanding on the status or key drivers of inland fisheries exists (Beard et al. 2011). Our lack of knowledge regarding the status results from the common belief that inland fishery harvests are widely under reported (FAO 2009; Welcomme et al. 2010), particularly the contributions from recreational, artisanal, and illegal fisheries (FAO 2003; Allan et al. 2005). Overcoming this knowledge gap has no simple solution, given that resources to conduct on-the-ground fisheries assessments are lacking throughout much of the world, particularly in Africa or Asia where the majority of the inland fisheries harvest for subsistence and commercial purposes occurs (FAO 2003). At the local level, the lack of reliable data on the status of fish populations constrains the ability of managers to intervene when fisheries are in decline, until the system has virtually collapsed. It is worth reemphasizing that sustainable inland fisheries are essential in the battle towards poverty eradication and improved nutrition in many of the least developed countries, and that poverty eradication is one of the key Millennium Development Goals set forth by the United Nations. Inland systems also will be vulnerable to changes in climate and land use in the coming century (Ficke et al. 2007; Brander 2007), and knowledge gaps in status and function of inland fisheries will exacerbate the inability of managers to mitigate climate-induced changes in fish populations. Relative to marine systems, habitats in inland systems will likely be more influenced by changes in precipitation patterns (and water levels) and thermal structure, and landlocked inland fish species likely have less ability to migrate to optimal water temperatures.   This project aimed to develop tools to narrow existing knowledge gaps on the status and key drivers of inland fisheries, given their importance in providing food and a means for poverty alleviation for people in developing countries and in driving economies in developed countries. By providing models that provide potentially less biased estimates of fish production as well as some key variables that could predict fish production, managers would have better information to both manage these key fisheries and their allied ecosystems presently and prepare for the effective governance of these resources in the face of future local and global climate, land and water induced changes.", "proj_items": {}, "num_items": 0}, "5b59e04fe4b0610d7f4da7d5": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b59e04fe4b0610d7f4da7d5", "proj_phrases": ["rainfall amount", "wildfire events", "hawai \u2018", "recent severe drought", "project researchers", "u.s.", "site-specific syntheses", "volcanoes national park", "working", "wildlife service", "long term", "wa \u2018 awa \u2018", "\u2018 i", "novel ecosystems", "wildlife", "wildfire risk", "state forest reserve", "fire behavior", "site-specific drought statistics", "drought resilience", "hawai", "best-available science", "managers", "volcanoes", "national park", "actionable science products", "fish", "u.s", "access best-available science", "relevant drought-related information", "individual land managers", "wa", "land management area", "pu \u2018", "multiple objectives", "geospatial data products", "\u2018 u", "specific science objectives", "historic climate variability", "assess manager responses", "future vegetation", "pu", "knowledge exchange process", "knowledge exchange", "drier climates", "\u2018 awa \u2018", "available data", "technical assistance process", "watershed function", "future climate projections", "important natural resources", "formal collaboration", "land managers", "co-produce drought data", "non-native species invasions", "potential management responses"], "avg_item_sim": 0, "proj_summary": "The climate in Hawai\u2018i is changing, and alterations in rainfall amount and distribution have implications for future vegetation cover, non-native species invasions, watershed function, and fire behavior.

Researchers evaluated the current and future breeding ranges of 15 bird and 16 reptile species in the western U.S. using a new approach that models variables such as temperature and precipition, terrain ruggedness and soil type, and plants that are commonly associated with each species.   Results showed that two-thirds of the species examined could be expected to experience a decrease in range, while one-third could experience an increase. Climate variables were found to play a bigger role than landscape or plant variables in determining changes in species range. Researchers also found that as available habitat patches for birds and reptiles become more isolated, their ranges also contract. This finding suggests that strategic management actions focused on conserving and restoring connections between habitat patches could help lessen the severity of the projected range contractions.

This information will then be used resource managers to determine whether the boundaries of the Special Ecological Areas need to be adjusted to account for future shifts in plant ranges.

The key objective of this project was to combine climate projections from the International Pacific Research Center (IPRC) and plant distribution models from Price et al. to produce a series of projected species range maps over the next century. Although the project focused on HAVO, the projected species range maps were created for seven of the main Hawaiian Islands. We stored the model output as rasters (.TIF files); additionally we created multi-panel maps of these rasters that are available separately. In summary, this dataset consists of 4,095 rasters that delineate plant species range, both present and future, for various climate change scenarios and years. The series covers 39 species, 7 islands, and 15 different combinations of climate trajectory and year. The contents of each raster varies slightly, but the contents can be determined from the specific filename. Filenames have a consistent naming convenion, as follows: Species name + island + file type + climate trajectory + year.TIF, where the following definitions apply: Species name = abbreviated code representing genus and species; Island = 1 of the main 7 Hawaiian Islands (Hawaii, Maui, Kahoolwe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, and Kauai); File type = one of 3 file types: (1) RANGE = present species range as of year 2000, (2) 80 PCT = binary raster of habitat suitability, (3) CHANGE TO 80 = raster showing the change in suitability between the year 2000 and the year indicated in the file name; Climate trajectory = lower (concave upward trajectory of change in rainfall and temperature over the century), middle (linear change in rainfall and temperature), upper (concave downward trajectory of change in rainfall and temperature), or future (where all three trajectories converge in 2090); Year = one of the following years: 2000, 2040, 2070, or 2090. For example, consider this filename: Acakoa Hawaii 80 pct future2090.tif. This filename defines the following: Species name = Acakoa (Acacia koa), Island = Hawaii island, File type = 80 pct, indicating that it is a binary raster of habitat suitability where a value of 1 means 80% of model iterations forecast suitable habitat, and a value of 0 means less than 80% of model runs project suitability, Climate trajectory = future, which represents the point in the future (2090) where the lower, middle and upper trajectories converge, Year = 2090 (end of century since that's when our climate data set series ends). The rasters produced in this study show the projected species range of 39 plant species at various points in time (from 2000-2090) and for various trajectories of climate change.

While a number of studies have begun to explore the futures of culturally significant species, these studies typically do so in isolation, focusing on individual plant species and single future scenarios, and involve little engagement with the people for whom such species are most important.  This project seeks to fill this gap by examining the future of culturally important species as climate conditions change, through close engagement with Indigenous stakeholders. Using an approach known as climate-analogue mapping, researchers will examine regions that are currently experiencing the specific climate conditions that are expected to be experienced by tribal lands in the future, as a means of forecasting potential future climate conditions for tribal lands. Researchers will then conduct a tribal needs assessment by convening a listening session at the United South and Eastern Tribes meeting, during which time they will solicit feedback on the best paths forward for studying and managing species on tribal lands, in light of global change. The team will frame the listening session around the following questions: (1) which species and phenomena should be studied; (2) at what spatial and temporal scale should they be studied; and (3) what management decisions would be most relevant.  This project will set the stage for the management of culturally important species on tribal lands across North America. Products such as an online interface and physical maps of the climate analogues will allow stakeholders to begin conversations with a common starting point and at least one tangible, common frame of refence.

Recent technological advances in stream temperature monitoring (e.g., digital data loggers and remote sensors) and modeling have increased the amount of data that are available (both observed and projected) throughout the region. These newly available data, although exciting, have strengths and limitations depending on the purposes for which they were developed and the scale(s) at which they can be used to address management questions. For instance, a spatially expansive stream temperature dataset may be perfect for answering questions about how species distributions may change, but it may not be very good for identifying localized cold water refuges. Future projections made using statistical models may not be accurate if extrapolated to conditions not seen historically, or if applied in new areas. To address these challenges, we propose to develop a handbook for natural resource managers that will guide the selection and use of stream temperature dataset(s) that are appropriate for answering management or conservation questions. We will engage with natural resource stakeholders in the Pacific Northwest to learn about pertinent management issues, stream temperature data already in use, and information gaps. Through close collaboration with these stakeholders, we will then develop the handbook to (1) summarize benefits and tradeoffs of existing observed and projected stream temperature datasets, (2) support decisions about which datasets are most appropriate for a given management question using decision trees, and (3) provide case study examples to illustrate potential applications of the handbook.", "proj_items": {}, "num_items": 0}, "5228d64ae4b06291bed806df": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5228d64ae4b06291bed806df", "proj_phrases": ["tribal staff", "science center", "northwest climate science center", "funding", "fifth annual pacific northwest climate science conference", "northwest", "private sector", "science conference", "tribal students", "september", "sponsorship ensures", "northwest climate conference", "conference website", "seattle", "washington", "scientific results", "natural resources", "resource managers", "september 9-10", "pacific northwest climate science conference", "premier climate science event", "climate", "sovereign tribal nations", "50 tribal staff", "non-governmental organizations", "annual", "conference participants", "climate change", "conference attendance", "public agencies"], "avg_item_sim": 0, "proj_summary": " The Northwest Climate Conference (formerly called the Pacific Northwest Climate Science Conference) is the premier climate science event for the region, providing a forum for researchers and practitioners to share scientific results and discuss challenges and solutions related to the impacts of climate change on people, natural resources, and infrastructure in the Northwest.

Climate change in the West is creating warmer and drier conditions, resulting in an increase in the amount of dead vegetation available to fuel fires.   This project seeks to assess the vulnerability of forests in the southwestern U.S. to climate change and wildfire, in order to understand how these ecosystems might become altered as a result. Researchers will examine (a) how climate change will impact wildfires in the region, to better understand fire risk; (b) identify where and when vegetation will be most sensitive to changing climate and fire conditions; and (c) determine the ability of vegetation to adapt to changing conditions, given appropriate management. Researchers will then work closely with public land managers to develop strategic management plans that enable forests to adapt to the changes that are occurring.   The results of this project will inform strategic management decisions regarding wildfire control on public lands. By identifying the current and future vulnerability of forests to changes in climate and wildfires, this project will support managers in prioritizing areas for proactive fire management in the face of uncertainty. This information will enable managers to more efficiently allocate resources to fire management by targeting areas that are most vulnerable, such as forests with high fuel loads.

In recognition of this challenge, regional drought early warning systems (DEWS) and related drought-information tools have been developed under the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS). Despite the existence of many tools and information sources, however, the factors that influence if a tool(s) is (are) used, which tools are used, and how much benefit those tools provide remain poorly understood. Using the Upper Colorado River DEWS as a case study, this study investigated how water, land, and fire managers select from among many available tools.  The Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) was one of the first pilot areas, beginning in 2009, for implementation of a regional drought early warning system (DEWS) under the NIDIS program, which now supports eight regional DEWS. (In 2016, the UCRB DEWS was expanded and reconfigured into the Intermountain West DEWS). The selection of the UCRB for a pilot DEWS reflects the regional importance of drought monitoring for managing water supply for agriculture and other uses, and the need for effective decision support related to drought. New drought-information tools were developed specifically for the UCRB DEWS, and a number of others have been created since 2009, adding to the pre-existing toolkit for drought decision making. The various tools that are now available in the Upper Colorado River Basin region can be expected to be more or less suitable for different decision makers\u2019 needs. As a result, the broad decision context of this case study (managing drought) was fixed, but the information needs of users varied. This provided the opportunity to examine the varied choices decision makers make about which of the available tools to use or not use.  The research identified four broad categories of tool use that map to particular decision contexts. Water supply managers, land managers with rangeland management responsibilities, land managers focused on ecological health, and fire managers each use a suite of indicators and tools that match their particular decision context and timeframe at which they make decisions. Important differences also emerged in how respondents find out about tools, with water managers reporting strong inter-agency connections while land managers tend to rely on information from others within their agencies. Fire managers also play a key role in keeping others in the land management agencies informed about drought.

We focused on five species of mammals in the alpine zone of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, including the federally endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep and the American pika, a species recently proposed for listing due to the loss of populations from altered climatic conditions. It is expected that there will be an upward expansion of trees and shrubs from lower elevations and that many or even most alpine meadows will be converted to woody dominated communities. Meadows provide critical habitat for many alpine mammal species, and their conversion could represent a major loss with severe consequences for the long-term persistence of these species. However, it is currently unknown whether the severity of the effects of meadow conversion on alpine mammals would be uniform or species-specific; all species could be impacted similarly; some species could be unaffected; or species currently not considered at risk may be seriously impacted. Moreover, while climate could potentially trigger changes in alpine vegetation communities, herbivorous and granivorous mammals could mediate the magnitude and extent of meadow conversion through their consumption of woody seeds and seedlings. In other words, feedbacks between climate and alpine mammals could result in the mammals \u201cmanaging their own habitat.\u201d Presently though, very little is known about vegetation or mammal communities in the alpine zone of the Sierra Nevada, especially in relation to climate change. Consequently, resource management agencies are seriously hindered in development of justifiable, long-term management strategies for bighorn sheep, pika, and other alpine mammals. To answer these questions, we modeled (1) the range shifts for five alpine mammal species and (2) the degree to which plant-animal interactions may alter what is often assumed to be an inevitable, climatically driven transition of alpine meadows to woody dominated communities in the Sierra Nevada.

Within Missouri, there are more than 85,000 acres of public conservation lands in large-river floodplains. Floodplain lands are highly dynamic and challenging to manage, particularly climatic conditions change. These lands have the potential to provide valuable ecosystem services, like wildlife habitat, nutrient processing, carbon sequestration, and flood-water storage, that produce economic values in terms of recreational spending, improved water quality, and decreased flood hazards. However, floodplain managers may need tools to help them understand changing conditions on conservation lands.  This project worked with floodplain managers to identify the information most needed to understand nonstationary conditions, and to develop tools they can apply to conservation lands to improve decision making. Through an online survey and workshop with managers, the researchers found that time, funding, and a perceived disconnect between research and management limited the ability of managers to use new scientific information. However, managers revealed that they were willing to partner with scientists to identify science needs and products useful for management decisions.  Floodplain managers agreed that metrics of water inundation, including depth, extent, frequency, duration, and seasonality are the most useful metrics to inform management of floodplain conservation lands. The research team used scientific models of flood inundation under different climate scenarios to examine these metrics for the lower 500 miles of the Missouri River to aid in current and future management decisions of conservation properties. They found that annually, climate change is estimated to increase the duration, frequency, depth, and extent of flooding. However, these patterns vary seasonally, with inundation increasing in the spring and decreasing in the fall.", "proj_items": {"5a396848e4b0d05ee8b412ef": {"item_summary": "Within large-river ecosystems, floodplains serve a variety of important ecological functions. A recent survey of 80 managers of floodplain conservation lands along the Upper and Middle Mississippi and Lower Missouri Rivers in the central United States found that the most critical information needed to improve floodplain management centered on metrics for characterizing depth, extent, frequency, duration, and timing of inundation. These metrics can be delivered to managers efficiently through cloud-based interactive maps. To calculate these metrics, we interpolated an existing one-dimensional HEC-RAS hydraulic model for the Lower Missouri River, which simulated water surface elevations at cross sections spaced (&lt;1 kilometer) to sufficiently characterize water surface profiles along an approximately 800 kilometer stretch upstream from the confluence with the Mississippi River over an 80-year record at a daily time step. To translate these water surface elevations to inundation depths, we subtracted a merged terrain model consisting of floodplain LIDAR and bathymetric surveys of the river channel. We completed these calculations for an 800 kilometer stretch of the Missouri River, spanning from Rulo, Nebraska to the river's confluence with the Mississippi River. This approach resulted in a 29,000+ day time series of inundation depths across the floodplain using grid cells with 30 meter spatial resolution. This dataset presents 17 metrics for each of two scenarios, one using a baseline timeseries of stages from the HEC-RAS simulation and one using a timeseries of stages adjusted to account for changes in discharge under one possible climate change scenario. These metrics are calculated on a per pixel basis and encompass a variety of temporal criteria generally relevant to flora and fauna of interest to floodplain managers, including, for example, the average number of days inundated per year within a growing season. We also include a series of maps of water depths across the floodplain by return interval for each scenario, and the minimum return interval at which each pixel is inundated. Lastly, we include the base elevation layer that we generated to calculate depth of inundation from interpolated water-surface elevations. This dataset was developed to quantify timing, extent, depth, and duration of inundation for floodplains on the Missouri River, and to assess relative potential for ecological restoration with a variety of biological endpoints. We developed a suite of metrics which characterize inundation timing and extent that will be useful to floodplain managers in for planning restoration efforts.

{"item_summary": "Within large-river ecosystems, floodplains serve a variety of important ecological functions. A recent survey of 80 managers of floodplain conservation lands along the Upper and Middle Mississippi and Lower Missouri Rivers in the central United States found that the most critical information needed to improve floodplain management centered on metrics for characterizing depth, extent, frequency, duration, and timing of inundation. These metrics can be delivered to managers efficiently through cloud-based interactive maps. To calculate these metrics, we interpolated an existing one-dimensional HEC-RAS hydraulic model for the Lower Missouri River, which simulated water surface elevations at cross sections spaced (&lt;1 kilometer) to sufficiently characterize water surface profiles along an approximately 800 kilometer stretch upstream from the confluence with the Mississippi River over an 80-year record at a daily time step. To translate these water surface elevations to inundation depths, we subtracted a merged terrain model consisting of floodplain LIDAR and bathymetric surveys of the river channel. We completed these calculations for an 800 kilometer stretch of the Missouri River, spanning from Rulo, Nebraska to the river's confluence with the Mississippi River. This approach resulted in a 29,000+ day time series of inundation depths across the floodplain using grid cells with 30 meter spatial resolution. This dataset presents 17 metrics for each of two scenarios, one using a baseline timeseries of stages from the HEC-RAS simulation and one using a timeseries of stages adjusted to account for changes in discharge under one possible climate change scenario. These metrics are calculated on a per pixel basis and encompass a variety of temporal criteria generally relevant to flora and fauna of interest to floodplain managers, including, for example, the average number of days inundated per year within a growing season. We also include a series of maps of water depths across the floodplain by return interval for each scenario, and the minimum return interval at which each pixel is inundated. Lastly, we include the base elevation layer that we generated to calculate depth of inundation from interpolated water-surface elevations. This dataset was developed to quantify timing, extent, depth, and duration of inundation for floodplains on the Missouri River, and to assess relative potential for ecological restoration with a variety of biological endpoints. We developed a suite of metrics which characterize inundation timing and extent that will be useful to floodplain managers in for planning restoration efforts. We developed these layers to quantify inundation metrics under a possible climate change scenario generated from CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, which we used to calculate offsets from the baseline scenario

The term \u201cecological drought\u201d emphasizes the environmental consequences of future droughts. While it is known that ecological drought places multiple stresses on the environment, many of the specific impacts are not fully understood. To address this need, researchers are working to synthesize knowledge on the impacts of ecological drought across the country and to develop tools and products that are useful for decision making.   A series of eight workshops aimed at synthesizing our existing knowledge of the ecological impacts of drought are planned for each of the eight Department of Interior Climate Science Centers.

Additionally, a group of scientists from the University of Maryland\u2019s Integration and Application Network (IAN) \u2013 a group specializing in science communication \u2013 will develop related communication products that effectively deliver the results to stakeholders.

Among land managers and tribes, there is a strong interest in preserving and restoring these culturally important plant species across the Pacific Northwest.  However, limited knowledge is available on the current ranges of shrub species, or how climate change will impact future ranges or the timing of flowering and fruiting for key Northwest shrub species.   The project team is partnering with several tribes and land management agencies to develop and package information on how climate change will impact where these plants can grow and the timing of flowering and fruit production of culturally important Northwestern shrubs. The team is first working with tribes to identify shrubs of significant cultural interest to focus on. They will then synthesize location and life history data from multiple inventory and scientific data sources to develop range maps and models for understanding past and future conditions for focal shrub species. This information will then be available through an online web-platform for users to explore.   Successful restoration strategies need accurate mapping tools and biological models that consider climate change to effectively conserve species in the future. Results from this project will be useful for resource managers and planners to identify geographic areas where climate change could significantly impact flowering and fruiting of edible shrubs, help managers determine priorities for competing projects, and identify if new areas might need to be developed for traditional use.

This project is examining the effects of reduced stream flow and higher stream temperature on Rio Grande cutthroat trout to identify how factors such as the survival of individual fish and the growth rates of entire populations may be changing. Once these effects have been identified, researchers will model the long-term survival of the subspecies under predicted future drought conditions.   Although the Rio Grande cutthroat trout is not at immediate risk of extinction according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, more than half of the remaining populations are considered to be in fair or poor condition. The results of this research will directly inform managers as to the vulnerability of this species to drought and which actions can be taken to increase the survival of Rio Grande cutthroat trout during drought.

The Marshallese have a long tradition of interplanting food-producing trees such as coconuts, breadfruit, and pandanus with bananas and root and vegetable crops. Locally grown food crops support community self-sufficiency, promote good nutrition, and can also serve as windbreaks and stabilize shorelines to lessen storm damage and erosion. However, climate change is posing serious challenges for growers, as they struggle to adapt to climate impacts including saltwater intrusion, changing precipitation and temperature patterns, and the spread of invasive species.  The goal of this project is to provide Marshallese agricultural producers with information and resources that will help them adapt their growing practices to changing climate conditions. Researchers are creating a living website that provides clear, actionable farming information displayed in a dashboard format. Users can find information in English and Marshallese about seasonal rainfall, winds, and sea level as well as agricultural calendars based on El Ni\u00f1o/ La Ni\u00f1a. The website also provides facts on traditional growing practices and timings, crop tolerances, and nutrition.

This project will address this gap in the characterization of fire risk using the newly developed monthly water balance model (MWBM). The MWBM takes into account rain, snow, snowmelt, glacier ice melt, and the permafrost layer to better calculate soil moisture replenishment and the amount of moisture that is lost to the atmosphere (evapotranspiration). Using this model, researchers will be able to refine the boundaries of fire-prone areas in Alaska, based on which areas are prone to particularly high moisture deficit and summer temperatures. Maps will be created that identify which regions of the state currently have a high risk of wildfire, as well as which regions can expect to have an elevated risk of fire in the future to support adaptation planning. This research will also have broad applicability to other regions of the country facing uncertainty about future wildfire risk.

Black bear, bighorn sheep, mule deer, and wild turkey are just a few of the species found in these isolated mountain ecosystems that rise out of the desert landscape. However, recent droughts have crippled these ecosystems, causing significant tree death. Climate predictions suggest that this region will only face hotter and drier conditions in the future, potentially stressing these ecosystems even further. Simple models predict that vegetation will move to cooler and wetter locations in response to this warming. However, species responses will likely be more complex than these models show, as vegetation navigates other ecological stressors such as elevation change and water availability.  In order to better predict how vegetation will move in response to future warming, a more robust understanding of how drought and temperature impact tree survival is needed. Focusing on three sky island habitats in western Texas, this project will identify the key traits influencing current distributions of forest tree species, determine the susceptibility of these species to drought and temperature, and develop fine-scale, localized climate projections that model future conditions for the study area. This information will then be used to predict how species might shift location in response to warmer and drier future climates, enabling managers to make more robust decisions that will preserve sky island forests in the face of a changing climate.

These include 18 species that are already federally listed as threatened or endangered and four other species petitioned for listing that are scheduled for development of Species Status Assessments (SSAs). Today, south Florida\u2019s pine rockland ecosystem represents less than 3 percent of its original extent. Threats such as saltwater intrusion from hurricanes and sea-level rise pose the greatest risk to the longevity of this ecosystem.  For the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make decisions about the potential listing of a species, they must be able to forecast a species\u2019 responses to potential future environmental conditions, as well as to different conservation and management actions. Yet, for many imperiled species in the pine rocklands, the information needed to complete these forecasts\u2014such as population trends, life history traits, habitat use, and future land use and climate conditions--is often lacking. This is especially problematic for assessments of species resiliency to changes in climate and land use.  When these types of data are lacking, information on habitat quality can be used to help determine how a species will respond to change. This project will evaluate habitat conditions for two species found in the pine rockland ecosystem - the rim rock crowned snake and the key ringneck snake. These species are being considered for federal listing, and very little is known about their ecology and demography. Researchers will identify potential future changes in habitat that could result from different management actions, such as habitat acquisition or restoration, and environmental conditions, such as changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms and rates of sea-level rise. They will then explore the potential impacts of these habitat condition changes on the rim rock crowned snake and key ringneck snake.  This information can be used to develop future habitat condition scenarios in forthcoming SSAs for these species. While this project focuses on these two species of snakes, the results could inform the conservation, management, and recovery of other at-risk species found in the pine rocklands ecosystem.

Not least among those uncertainties are questions regarding future climate conditions. Technological advancements have enhanced our ability to understand and model climate, which has led to improved climate forecasting capabilities. However, climate projections are usually produced at a global scale, which makes them impractical for natural resource managers who are concerned with how climate will change in the specific location or region in which they operate. While there have been a growing number of techniques for increasing the resolution of these projections, resource managers are given little guidance on how to choose the best method or model to meet their needs.   This project will provide managers with much needed guidance on how to navigate the range of available modeling methods, and to identify situations in which these climate models will be most useful. For example, managers could invest in improving modeling techniques to achieve a more specific understanding of future climate conditions, but this investment may not yield the desired results, and resources may be better spent elsewhere. This project will help natural resource managers understand the types of information that can plausibly be gained from climate projections, how to use climate models to inform management decisions, and how to best utilize available climate information to meet their needs while coping with uncertainty.

To help address this informational need, the project team conducted an extensive, systematic literature review to identify examples of both projected and documented effects of climate change on fish globally. The researchers categorized the documented studies into 6 groups based on the type of response variable studied (i.e., demography, phenology, distribution, etc.), and used the associated data to quantitatively analyze trends across species and locations.

A previous Northeast CSC-funded project modeled lake temperatures to help state agencies in the Midwest understand trends in walleye and largemouth bass populations and predict lake-specific fish populations under future climate scenarios. These results have been extremely valuable for decisions and management strategies at the state scale, and this new project will expand these efforts and will focus on lake temperature products at the three spatial scales of most interest to state agency stakeholders: lake, state, and region (for Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan).   The project researchers will use a \u201chyperscale\u201d modeling approach that will build upon the multi-state modeling framework developed in the earlier project to increase model accuracy for high priority managed lakes.

Studying them and copying their characteristics can also help humans build our homes and communities to be more resistant to wildfire.

This research developed a method to group watersheds that are gaged with watersheds that are not gaged so that accurate estimates of water availability can be provided regionally. To accomplish this, various models, techniques, and data were used to group watersheds across the southeastern United States. This means that watersheds were not necessarily grouped by proximity to one another, but instead were grouped based on their response to climate and their landscape setting.

Hence, berries have both nutritional and cultural significance.   From 2008 to 2012, wild berry populations in the Chugach region were decimated by an unexpected outbreak of moths, thought to have been brought about by shifting climate (i.e., warmer temperatures allowed a greater number of moths to survive the winter). This outbreak amounted to a total loss of blueberry and salmonberry harvests during these years, jeopardizing a tribal for-profit enterprise in the region. It also led to a need to restore berry production and to prepare for future threats from damaging insects.

The resulting maps and models are helping tribal forest managers and local landowners target their berry restoration efforts where they are most likely to be successful and protected from future insect outbreaks, contributing to the reestablishment and future resilience of wild berry populations.

Winters are expected to become wetter and summers could become drier. Snowpack will likely decrease substantially, and snowmelt runoff may occur earlier in the year. Wildfires are projected to become more frequent and severe, and forest types are expected to change from maritime evergreen to subtropical mixed-woodlands.   Because the impacts of climate change vary from place to place, regionally-specific climate projections are critical to help farmers, foresters, city planners, public utility providers, and fish and wildlife managers plan for how to best manage resources. However, the models that are used to project changes in climate are produced at the global scale and do not provide the degree of resolution necessary for generating meaningful projections about changing conditions for a given region.   To address this need, researchers first evaluated the ability of different global climate models to simulate observed patterns in the Northwest. The best-performing models were then downscaled \u2013 that is, transformed from a global scale to a regional scale. Researchers then used the downscaled models to project future changes in climate, vegetation, and hydrology in the region.   This project resulted in publically-available datasets that can be used to address place-based management questions in the Northwest and to develop strategies for reducing the impacts of climate change on the region\u2019s ecosystems, agricultural systems, and built environments. For example, the results can help managers identify forests and grasslands that are most vulnerable to climate change, enabling them to prioritize investments to increase the resilience of these landscapes.

Further, future climatic changes will continue to affect human land-use, temperature, and water flows. Natural resource managers need to identify and prioritize habitats so that limited time and funding can be focused on habitats that are in most need of protection both now and in the future, based on projected climate changes. This project was comprised of a team of scientists from the US Geological Survey, Kansas State University, Michigan State University, Penn State University, the University of Minnesota-Duluth, the University of Washington, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Researchers modeled anticipated changes in fish habitat using downscaled global climate change models to predict alterations of water temperature, hydrology, and land-use under different possible scenarios. This project worked closely with the existing partnership-driven National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHAP) to link global climate change models and predicted land-use changes to the Nation\u2019s aquatic habitats. The effects of climate change on fish and fish habitat was conducted at three spatial scales. First, a coarse-scale nationwide assessment of how habitat will change with climate was conducted. Second, we used data specific to selected U.S. regions to refine our predicted changes in fish habitat among varying climate and land-use patterns in the Desert Southwest, the Rocky Mountain West, the Northern Glacial Lakes, and the Northeast U.S., and different aquatic systems such as warmwater rivers, glacial lakes, and coldwater streams. Finally, we also determined how selected fish distributions may change with altered climate. For example, the coldwater habitat needed for cisco in lakes in the Upper Midwest is diminishing and may affect the distribution of this critical species. We provided state and federal agencies, non-government organizations, and other stakeholders with GIS-based maps at national and regional scales, showing how habitat will change with climate and land-use change, and information on how those changes affect fish populations. A final report synthesizing this large effort was produced and distributed to all interested stakeholders, in addition to peer-reviewed publications for the scientific community. Lastly, the project trained five PhD students and post doctoral researchers so that these students can continue in their professional careers, helping resource managers deal with the effects of climate change. The project leveraged over $1 million in current partnership-driven nationwide and regional fish habitat assessments through the 300-member NFHAP. The results from this study will allow agencies to assess risks and determine how they will manage fish habitat and fish communities in a changing climate.

Runoff from glaciers, for example, significantly impacts the water temperature and clarity of aquatic habitats, which are important conditions for salmon reproduction. Moreover, runoff from glaciers along the GOA is an important factor in the structure of the Alaska Coastal Current, which, in turn, sustains multi-million dollar commercial fisheries, subsistence fisheries, and millions of coastal marine birds and mammals.

Will they be stable or unstable? Will the waters be cold and clear or warm and muddy? Will they have salmon or other species? These questions motivated our two-year study of climate warming effects on headwater streams draining the Cascade Mountains. Using a novel combination of snow, geohydrology, and sediment transport models we assessed the vulnerability of stream channels to changing peak streamflow. Our snow modeling shows that with just a 2\u00b0C warming, snowfall shifts to rainfall at all elevations, peak snowpacks occur over two months earlier, and snowpacks are reduced by over half of historical values. Our geohydrology modeling shows that greater rainfall and earlier snowmelt enhances peak winter streamflows but impacts depend on snow amount and watershed geohydrology. In spring-fed watersheds, increased winter flows are within historical bounds. In runoff-dominated watersheds, increased winter flows will exceed the historical range by up to 44% and the frequency of high flows will increase by over 100 days per year. Since streambed gravels and sand are transported during high flows, climate warming is likely to result in a dramatic increase in the amount of sediment moving through Cascade streams. Daily sediment transport rates in the surface-runoff system could potentially double. Besides affecting water quality with increased levels of suspended sediment, more frequent sediment transport events may lead to instability in the gravels where bull trout and salmon lay their eggs, making their survival less certain in the future. A key aspect of this project was engaging managers through a knowledge- to-action approach. Stakeholder dialogues were held in organized workshops and informal discussions through which we shared needs, information, and knowledge to interpret the consequences of these projected changes for water supply, threatened and endangered aquatic species, and dam operations.

This region is a primary nesting site for many migratory birds. The YKD, meanwhile, is a vast wetland/tundra landscape on Alaska\u2019s remote western coast. One of the largest deltas in the world, the YKD supports millions of nesting and migrating waterfowl and shorebirds, and is the largest goose nesting habitat in North America.   As climate conditions change and permafrost decreases in thickness and extent, these important landscapes are at risk of undergoing significant change. To conserve these rich ecosystems, managers require information on both current ecosystem conditions and projected changes in the landscape that might occur as temperatures and precipitation patterns change. This project seeks to meet this need by exploring the vulnerability of the ACP and YKD to changing climate conditions and characterizing the impacts of future landscape changes on shorebird and waterfowl populations. Researchers will develop high-resolution maps of current land cover, as well as maps showing projected change in land cover through 2100.

Managers require a suite of potential adaptive management options that could be implemented depending on how conditions change. Although general adaptation strategies have been suggested for sustaining forests, it is unclear how effective these strategies would be for maintaining forests \u2013 and the wildlife that depend on forests \u2013 at local or regional levels. In addition, these strategies have not been developed into explicit decision-support tools that could guide regional conservation planning. This lack of information hampers the ability of resource managers to anticipate landscape-level changes in forests and identify appropriate adaptive responses.   Focusing on the Adirondack Region of New York, the goal of this project is to inform forest and wildlife management decisions in light of changing conditions. Researchers will use a framework that incorporates the effects of future disturbances (e.g. wildfires or drought), insects and diseases, changing climate conditions, and different adaptive management approaches on forest conservation. Using this integrative approach, researchers will be able to model the future distribution and condition of forests under different scenarios of climate change, disturbance, and invasive species, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of different adaptive management strategies under alternative scenarios.   The results of this project will inform not only forest conservation, but also wildlife conservation in the Adirondacks. For example, the results will support current work by the Wildlife Conservation Society examining the vulnerability of bird species in the Adirondacks. The results will also be incorporated into a Northeast Climate Science Center project on adaptive management for priority species in montane spruce-fir ecosystems in the Northeast.

This project assessed the vulnerability of key sea turtle nesting beaches to climate change in the Southeast. Researchers examined previous records of sea turtle nesting locations in the Southeast to identify the characteristics of these beaches, then predicted the future suitability of these beaches for nesting based on projected climate change. Beaches on both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are expected to be very susceptible to change associated with sea-level rise, making it imperitive that we understand how these changes will affect the suitability of nesting sites.   The results of this work can be used to directly inform federal recovery efforts for the loggerhead sea turtle. Identifying locations where beach habitat will no longer be suitable for nesting will help managers determine what action needs to be taken to protect loggerheads, such as moving nests out of highly vulnerable areas. Further, some of the nesting beaches used by loggerheads are also used by other endangered sea turtles, such as the Kemp\u2019s ridley, green, and leatherback sea turtles.

These trees currently face multiple threats, including attack by the mountain pine beetle, which has recently killed whitebark pines over much of the western U.S. Climate is an important factor in these outbreaks, and future warming is expected to affect epidemics. Our project developed statistical models of outbreaks in whitebark pine for three regions: the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Northern U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the Cascade Range. We used these models to understand climate/beetle outbreak relationships, evaluate climatic causes of recent outbreaks, and estimate the potential for future outbreaks given projections of climate change. The models fit the observations well, indicating confidence in their reliability. Climate influenced mountain pine beetle outbreaks through fall and winter temperatures, which are direct effects on beetles, as well as via reduced summer precipitation which increases drought stress on trees. Recent outbreaks were caused by warming and drought in the early 2000s. We found that, compared with a baseline of 1985-1994 when little beetle activity occurred, future climate will be more favorable for mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, our preliminary results indicate that some projections were similar to or exceed the climate favorability of conditions during the recent severe and extensive outbreak (2000-2009). Variability existed among outbreak projections as a result of the amount of future warming and changes in precipitation, which are functions of climate model, emissions scenario, and decade.

Climate refugia provide a potential opportunity for conserving resources and biodiversity in the face of climate change. These refugia are places where the climate will likely change less than the surrounding landscape and/or places in a landscape where species may move to find more suitable climates. For example, because climate change may alter the frequency, duration, or severity of droughts, small habitats that naturally retain water (drought refugia) may become increasingly important to many natural wildlife communities.  Although several approaches have been suggested for identifying climate refugia, large-scale mapping and evaluation of refugia have not yet been conducted in the Pacific Northwest. To address this information gap, researchers used existing information on hydrology, soil characteristics, topography etc. to map areas of refugia that can protect wildlife from regional changes in temperature and precipitation. The researchers mapped, explored, and compared several different types of refugia, both small and large. This included microrefugia from drought in the face of reduced snowpack and drought-induced insect outbreaks, as well as macrorefugia identified by projecting the future locations of today\u2019s climate conditions.

This analysis involved several steps. First, time-series climate data were compiled and plotted to identify drought periods. Similarly, time-series data representing insect outbreaks were compiled and plotted to identify trends in insect mortality. The study area was classified into forest canopy types using existing modeled estimates of tree basal area by tree species. Using remotely-sensed Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) from the Landsat archive, NDMI anomalies from reference conditions were calculated in 2001 and 2009. Based on these anomalies, and using the forest classification map, refugia from drought (in 2001) and combined drought-MPB effects (in 2009) were identified as NDMI anomalies greater than the 90th-percentile value within each forest type. Once refugia had been identified, landscape variables (topographic, soil, and forest stand characteristics) were compiled and used to model the landscape controls on refugia locations using Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) modeling, a machine-learning algorithm. For detailed descriptions of data-release components, please consult the appropriate metadata documents that accompany the processing scripts and data products. The processing scripts and data products presented here are intended to accompany and support a peer-reviewed journal article (in preparation) documenting the identification of refugia from drought and mountain pine beetle in a whitebark and lodgepole pine ecosystem. Drought and insect outbreaks are two primary disturbance processes linking climate change to tree mortality in western North America. Climate-change refugia are landscape locations that may be buffered against detrimental ecological effects of climate change and thus may be priorities for conservation, monitoring, and restoration. Knowledge of physiological effects of drought and mountain pine beetle attack  combined with recent advances in understanding landscape drivers of microenvironmental conditions (e.g. spatial patterns in soil moisture) can be used to develop a set of hypotheses for where refugia may occur. The aim of this study was to evaluate these hypotheses by (1) identifying refugia using remotely-sensed vegetation characteristics, and (2) modeling the landscape controls (topographic, soil, and forest characteristics) on refugia locations.", "avg_sim": 0.6225, "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59637fdbe4b0d1f9f059d824", "weighted_sim": 0.6067, "item_phrases":

of spring-dependent ecosystems to inter-annual changes in water availability. This approach uses remotely-sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to (1) delineate surface moisture zones (SMZs) in the vicinity of mapped springs in a semi-arid sage-steppe landscape, (2) derive quantitative indicators of the relative resilience of these SMZs to inter-annual changes in water availability, and (3) synthesize these indicators into an overall resilience score for each cluster of springs. Specifically, for 39 spring clusters mapped in the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) in Harney County, Oregon, USA, these scripts process Landsat-derived NDVI and precipitation data from 1985-2011 to derive 7 potential indicators of SMZ resilience to water-cycle changes. This data release also includes a geodatabase containing spatial data products produced by the scripts. For detailed descriptions of data release components, please consult the appropriate metadata documents that accompany the processing scripts and data products. The processing scripts and data products presented here demonstrate proof-of-concept for a novel remote-sensing based analysis to assess resilience of springs to inter-annual changes in water availability. This approach involves the delineation and assessment of surface moisture zones (SMZs) in the vicinity of mapped springs in a semi-arid sage-steppe landscape.

With this study, researchers are working to fill this knowledge gap by estimating the overall fishery production in river networks globally using multivariate statistical models with explanatory variables compiled from remotely sensed and in\u2010situ observations.  The freshwater fish production in rivers is being estimated by:  1. Developing models using key drivers (temperature, precipitation, land use variables etc.) that impact fish production and validating these models using existing harvest data from river fisheries.  2. Predicting the response of river fish production to global change (climate and land use) using the present day river fish production model as a baseline and using downscaled climate scenarios. We are focusing on global inland river systems which will complement another project focusing on estimation of fishery production from the lakes (Bunnell et al. 2014, Deines et al. 2014).   Fisheries data from global rivers are currently not collected in a standardized format. By developing a standardized database and then a transferable global production model we will be able to  remotely estimate drivers of fish productivity and compare them with in\u2010situ data collected from regions with current field assessment programs.

Climate change adds a layer of complexity to the planning process because of its uncertain effects on the environment. In order to make sound decisions, managers need information about how climate change will affect wildlife habitat, both on its own and in conjunction with management actions.  The goal of this project was to explore how future climate may interact with management alternatives to shape wildlife habitat across large landscapes. Scientists used computer simulations to investigate a range of future climate and management scenarios, focusing on habitat for two iconic species: the northern spotted owl and the greater sage-grouse.  Findings reveal that increasing wildfire is likely to be the primary threat to owl habitat as a result of climate change. Management actions that reduce the amount of vegetation available as fuel may be helpful at counteracting this threat, at least in southwestern Oregon. In the case of the greater sage-grouse, expected increases in wildfire may actually be helpful for managers, as they help to control the spread of juniper. However, invasive grasses are poised to overtake much of the landscape, creating a new management challenge.  While the task of managing habitat in the face of climate change is daunting, this research yielded information that may be useful for setting management priorities and developing strategies that sustain these landscapes for both humans and wildlife.

the Path Landscape Model software, version 3.0.4. Later versions of the software cannot run these files. To get a copy of this software, please contact Apex RMS at path@apexrms.com. 1) \"Path Landscape Mode\" folder contains files to be run in the PLM softwarel, version 3.0.4 or later. Path models MUST be run with the provided MCM mulitplier files to apply the required transition probability adjustments for procesess such as insect outbreaks, wildfire, and climate change trends. Each Path database is set up with three folders: - The 'Common' folder contains a single Path scenario (also named 'Common'). The Transitions tab within the Common scenario contains the climate-smart STM. - The 'Multipliers' folder contains multipliers specific to each ownership-allocation to activate or deactivate transitions (both climate change and management). Actual treatments are input in the Treatments tab for each stratum in the 'Runs' folder. - The 'Runs' folder contains one Path scenario per modeling stratum, with initial conditions specific to each stratum (combination of watershed and ownership-allocation). The models are stored as a dependency from the 'Common' folder and the multipliers as a dependency from the 'Multipliers' scenario. For the scenarios that have management activities (current and restoration management), a specified number of acres for each treatment is shown in the Treatments tab for treated stata. There are 12 databases, one for each combintation of management and climate scenario run in southeast Oregon. Climate scenarios include: - No climate change - continuing current climate (NoCC) - HadGEM global circulation model, representative concentration pathway 8.5 (HadGEM) - NorESM global circulation model, representative concentration pathway 8.5 (NorESM) - MRI global circulation model, representative concentration pathway 8.5 (MRI) Management scenarios include: - No management - no restoration treatments (NoMgt) - Current management - current treatment rates compiled from managers in the region (CurMgt) - Restoration management - a restoration scenario to restore sage-grouse habitat (RestMgt) 2) The \"lookupTables\" folder contains files necessary for providing definitions and context for the information located in other folders. 3) The 'Spatial' folder contains the SEO region stratum map, called SEO_Modeling_Strata.tif. This map can be joined to output from the climate-informed state-and-transition models to map projected future condition or sage-grouse habitat on the \"Strata\" field. Modeling strata consist of the intersection of watershed (Hydrologic unit code [HUC]) and ownership-allocation map. Watersheds are three digit codes starting at 101. Ownership-allocation categories are a two-character label, and are described in the attribute table through the fields \"Ownership\", and \"Allocation\". The field ScenarioID indicates the internal ID number used by the Path software to link results for modeling strata to its Scenario names. 4) This folder contains summarized modeling results that can be viewed as nonspatial trends across the whole landscape or displayed across mapped modeling strata. The .tif file in the 3Spatial folder shows the spatial distribution of modeling strata. There are 3 subfolders: ClassesSummary, TransitionSummary, and HabitatSummary. The csv files within ClassesSummary contain summaries of state class area (in Acres) for each timestep, over monte carlo repetitions, within each modeling stratum. Those within TransitionSummary are summarized in the same manner, but contain summaries of area affected by each Transition Type. The csv files within HabitatSummary are designed to be joined ot the grid mentioned above, to allow for a spatial depiction of habitat projections. There is one column per modeled year, containing a summary that indicates the proportion of each modeling stratum that is comprised of potential greater sage grouse habitat (the general summary, not the high-quality summary, averaged over monte carlo repetitions). Sample queries outlining how to build new summaries of output data for mapping from the ClassesSummary files and lookup tables are included in the database: SEO_Summaries.accdb. Due to a minor error in starting conditions, summaries of sage-grouse habitat may be underestimated in the early years, especially within the northwestern quadrant of the map. Because of this, we have removed the summaries of the first four years within the Habitat summary files, and constrain the sample queries to only show projections for after 2011. If the early years of this summary data are needed for viewing other parts of the map, they can be constructed by removing a constraint within query1 of the sample queries shown above. Balancing socio-economic and ecological demands on forests is an ongoing challenge and may be further complicated by future changes in climate. Land managers need information on the potential effects of climate change for future management planning that considers the diversity of valuable natural resources (forest products, clean water, wildfire control, etc.) that are linked to vegetation. The objectives of this project are to explore how climate and land management in southwestern Oregon and coastal Washington might interact to shape future vegetation and wildlife habitat, and determine what management actions will likely maximize habitats for key species. Through computer simulations that are run under a range of future management and climate scenarios, this project will build upon a body of knowledge that can help inform management planning for a changing future, raising the likelihood that ecosystems can be sustained for both humans and wildlife.", "avg_sim": 0.65, "item_url":

We compared the accuracy and bias associated with flow metrics that were generated using Vflo at both a daily and monthly time step in the Canadian River basin, USA. First, we calibrated and applied bias correction to the Vflo model to simulate streamflow at ungaged catchment locations. Next, flow metrics were calculated using both simulated and observed data from stream gage locations. We found discharge predictions using Vflo were more accurate than using drainage area ratios. General correspondence between predicted discharge and the gage data was apparent; however, flow metrics calculated using the Vflo output did not accurately represent flow variability.

The Canadian River and other rivers in the Great Plains tend to have highly variable flows and harsh environmental conditions. The combination of these environmental conditions makes semi-arid and arid regions difficult to represent with a hydrologic model, especially extreme events. In some cases, overestimating flows may be acceptable to water managers (e.g., vulnerability of infrastructures), but could greatly affect estimates of fish species persistence. To address incidences where poor model performance affected metrics derived from Vflo simulations, we suggest three possible options. 1) Restrict flow-ecology relationships to the mainstem of the Canadian River below Lake Meredith, 2) Restrict assessments to streamflow data aggregated at a monthly time step (although typically, this does not match ecological processes well); 3) Focus on streamflow metrics with a high prediction accuracy (e.g., magnitude, timing and duration at some locations). To maximize the number of potential explanatory variables and survey locations available in the Canadian River basin for the development of flow-ecology response models and minimize bias and uncertainty, a combination of these approaches is likely warranted. To move forward on flow-ecology relationships with valid statistical power, the compiled fish data (see processing steps) is best combined with available gage data to improve the development of ecological relationships.

These stocks are routinely monitored, and the FAO assessment describes the extent of exploitation against different reference points - such as underfished, sustainable fished, or overfished. Although inland fisheries, which represent 12% of total global capture fishery production, provide important economic and social services, including accessible and affordable high-quality protein to some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations, FAO has no comparable system for assessing the state of inland fisheries. This is a critical knowledge gap to maintaining sustainable fisheries, which play an important role in feeding the world's growing human population.  Defining the sustainability of inland fisheries has proven challenging because the sector lacks the traditional assessment processes necessary for estimating harvest potential. Globally, assessing and monitoring inland fisheries activities is costly and time-consuming, because inland fisheries are diverse and are highly dispersed across watersheds. As a result, there is often no baseline estimate of inland fish production or harvest. Without such baseline estimates, it is difficult to determine the impact of harvest and changes in climate and land use on inland fish production. This project seeks to develop a scalable framework, based on measures of threats and adaptive capacity, to assess the current and future status of inland fisheries worldwide.

The distribution and flow of water on a landscape influences many ecological functions, such as the distribution and health of vegetation and soil development and function. However, the future of many important water resources remains uncertain. Reduced snowfall and snowpack, earlier spring runoff, increased winter streamflow and flooding, and decreased summer streamflow have all been identified as potential impacts to water resources due to climate change. These factors all influence the water balance in the Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest (PCTR).  Ensuring healthy flow and availability of water resources is often highlighted as a priority in land management planning and adaptation. Improved measurement and modeling of water is required to develop predictive estimates for future plant distributions, soil moisture, and snowpack, which all play important roles in ecosystem planning.  The goal of this project is to develop a model to predict future groundwater. Using remote sensing, digital elevation models, GIS, and spatial analysis techniques the project team will create a data framework to support modeling of hydrology at the landscape scale in the Alaska PCTR.

The extent of this dataset includes all of the Alaska and Canada watersheds that discharge into southeast Alaska coastal waters, which covers essentially the northern half of the full PCTR.    The transboundary DEM used to calculate the CTI can be here: [link](http://ckan.snap.uaf.edu/dataset/a-continuous-transboundary-50-meter-dem-for-the-alaska-perhumid-coastal-temperate-rainforest-ak06b59)  Flow accumulation is represented by a grid of specific catchment area (SCA), which is the contributing area per unit contour length using the multiple flow direction D-infinity approach. Unit contour length is equal to the DEM resolution of 50 meters.   **There are two versions of both the CTI and SCA provided:**  *CTI_AKPCTR_NoFlowMask.tif and SCA_AKPCTR_NoFlowMask.tif* This is the resulting CTI file when no masks are applied to the study area before the CTI procedure is run. After the CTI procedure is run, all glacial areas are masked out, as CTI is not meaningful over glaciers.  *CTI_AKPCTR_FlowMask.tif and SCA_AKPCTR_FlowMask.tif* This is the resulting CTI file where prior to running the CTI procedure, we apply a mask across all active glaciers and all downslope cells receiving flow from glacially affected cells. These masked cells are excluded from the CTI procedure. This results in fewer CTI values on the landscape. This dataset is provided to identify cells in the direct downslope path of glaciers because CTI values for cells receiving upslope accumulation from glaciers may not be reliable due to uncertainties in surface water flowpaths in glaciated areas.  **Processing Steps:** 1. Using the pitremove function from [TAUDEM](http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/index.html), filled sinks in the DEM following the method of Planchon and Darboux (2001).  2. (For **_FlowMask* versions only) Mask out glacial areas and associated downslope cells. Prior to calculating flow direction and flow accumulation, change cells in the filled DEM to NoData where glaciers exist, using the [Randolph Glacier Inventory version 5.0](https://www.glims.org/RGI/rgi50_dl.html) raster dataset to identify the presence of glaciers. Cells downslope from the masked glaciers will then also be identified as NoData in subsequent processing and the final CTI raster. Compute D-infinity slopes and flow direction and flow accumulation (as specific catchment area) rasters from the filled DEM using TAUDEM D-infinity method. As part of the D-infinity routine, TauDEM uses the method of Garbrecht &amp; Martz (1997) to resolve flats.  3. The D-infinity slope raster was modified in the following way: if slope = 0, then change slope value to 0.0001; otherwise leave slope value unchanged. This was done to avoid dividing by zero when calculating CTI.  4. Compute Compound Topographic Index (CTI) using these steps: Dsca = D-infinity specific catchment area raster Dslp = D-infinity slope raster Then, CTI = Ln(Dsca/Dslp)  5. Clip the CTI raster to the Alaska perhumid coastal temperate rainforest (AKPCTR) watershed boundary   The motivation for developing this dataset was to support research studies focused on the Alaska perhumid coastal temperate rainforest.

Horizontal datum=NAD83; vertical datum=NGVD29; map units=decimal degrees; elevation units=meters. [Note: the term \"3DEP\" has replaced \"NED.\"]  2) The 25-meter resolution, 1:20,000 British Columbia Terrain Resource Information Management (TRIM) DEM, downloaded 9/4/2009. Horizontal datum=NAD83; vertical datum=CGVD28; projection=BC Albers; map units=meters; elevation units=meters.  3) The 0.75-arc-second, 1:50,000 [Canadian Digital Elevation Data (CDED)](ftp://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/geobase/official/cded/50k_dem/) DEM for the Yukon Territory, downloaded 8/11/2015. Horizontal datum=NAD83; vertical datum=CGVD28; map units=decimal degrees; elevation units=meters.  The 3 DEMs were projected to a common coordinate system, resolution, and registration. The Canadian TRIM and CDED datasets were combined, then a program called \u201cMerge\u201d was used to join the Canada DEM to the NED. The different processing methods, scales, and vertical datums used to produce the source U.S. and Canada DEMs result in a visible seam where the 2 datasets are joined. The \u201cMerge\u201d program creates a smooth transition along the seam between the NED and Canada DEMs (see process steps for details).  Portions of the NED for Southeast Alaska have been updated with higher-resolution IfSAR and LiDAR data; however the vertical datum for this newer data is based on NAVD88. Using the updated portions of the NED would result in an AKPCTR DEM containing a mix of NAVD88, NGVD29, and CGVD28 elevations. There are no datum converters for Alaska to easily transform between NAVD88 and NGVD29 or CGVD28. To avoid the mix of vertical datums and to be more consistent with adjacent Canadian elevations in CGVD28, the older version of the NED (pre-LiDAR and IfSAR) was used. Source data for the Alaska and Canada DEMs range from the 1940's to 2002. AKPCTR_DEM provides elevation values of the bare-earth surface for use in analysis, mapping, and display.

recreational sport fishing as well as for commercial fish production. However, climate change is causing lower and warmer summer stream flows that could decimate these fish populations. Aquatic cold-water habitats are further threatened by stormwater runoff, which moves from streets to storm drains and then is often discharged into cold-water rivers and streams. The urban heat island effect (when cities and urban areas are warmer than surrounding rural areas) may heat the temperature of the runoff and if the runoff is very warm, it could tip salmon habitat into fatal conditions.  However, specifically how urban warming \u2013 or cooling, such as by tree shade \u2013 affects the temperature of stormwater runoff from streets to storm drains is not well documented or understood.  Urban street trees are already well known, and even managed, to help trap rainfall and reduce runoff quantity. This study will test whether or not street trees could also be managed in ways that help reduce runoff temperature. Data gathered from streets in Portland, OR, will document how runoff temperature is affected by the amount and type (deciduous vs. conifer) of street trees in different locations and seasons over two years. The data will then be used to improve computer models that currently show the benefits of street trees but which do not yet consider runoff temperature. These models are widely used by cities to help with tree planting and management decisions. The results of this project will provide missing information to cities throughout the Pacific Northwest, on how to use existing street tree \u201cinfrastructure\u201d to, at little additional cost, also help reduce the negative impacts that warm urban runoff can have on aquatic ecosystems already stressed by drought and climate change.

However, snow droughts significantly lower snow accumulations, disrupting these critical water supplies for local communities and ecosystems. Despite its large influence on land- and water-resource management, snow drought has only recently been properly defined and its historical distribution and effects on key natural resources are essentially unknown. To remedy this serious knowledge gap, project researchers are examining the causes, effects, and forecastability of snow drought to provide needed scientific information and guidance to planners and decision makers.   The central goals of this proposal are to better quantify the impact of snow droughts on municipal and ecosystem water supplies and improve the scientific information accessible to a wide range of resource managers. The project consists of three primary objectives: 1) Document the types, frequencies, and proximate causes of historical snow drought using snow and climate observations, 2) Assess streamflow forecasting abilities following snow drought using the operational regression-based forecasts used by water management agencies, and 3) Identify areas where streamflow forecast skill is improved by incorporating snow drought information.   Preliminary analyses indicate that several different types of snow droughts occur in the Southwest, arising from a variety of different factors. \u201cDry snow drought\u201d is caused by a lack of winter precipitation needed to accumulate snow. \u201cWarm snow drought\u201d can be caused by early snowmelt or by precipitation falling as rain rather than snow.

Coastal habitats also provide protective ecosystem services to human communities, which are increasingly at risk to storms and sea level rise under future climate change. Understanding how climate change will impact natural and human communities is a crucial part of decision making and management related to the protection of our coasts.   In a collaborative project between the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NA LCC) and the Northeast Climate Science Center, researchers compiled existing threshold information on priority coastal fish, wildlife, and plant species as well as coastal habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and Caribbean in response to sea level rise and storm projections. As the effects of climate change on ecological and human communities grow, the possibility of crossing tipping points or thresholds of viability increases the potential for rapid and possibly irreversible changes in ecosystems. Therefore, understanding thresholds related to climate change is critical for facilitating conservation and management actions, which could help to prevent more costly and possibly catastrophic effects in the near (years to decades) and distant (decades to centuries) future. The compilation of this information will help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how natural systems will respond to climate change and how land and resource management decisions could potentially help these species.     Researchers further compiled natural and nature-based approaches to restoration and management that benefit both natural and human communities in the coastal zone, as well as synthesized information on the suite of ecosystem services provided by tidal marshes, beaches and barrier islands, mangroves, and shellfish beds. This work will inform climate change adaptation and resilience planning and assist coastal communities that must weigh important tradeoffs regarding the benefits and drawbacks of green and grey coastal infrastructure.   Results from these synthesis activities have been presented in several formats, including easily accessible topic-specific web pages in the online Massachusetts Wildlife Climate Action Tool.

Assessments of the effects of climate change on these \u201cecosystem services\u201d have been hindered by a lack of tools (e.g. computer models) capable of forecasting future landscapes in a changing climate while taking into account numerous other factors such as changing fire patterns, vegetation growth, organic materials in soil, and seasonal thaw of frozen ground.  As a response to this need, the Integrated Ecosystem Model (IEM) was designed and developed to help resource managers understand how Alaskan ecosystems will change in the future as our climate changes. The IEM generates maps and other products that illustrate how arctic and boreal landscapes might change in response to other climate change-driven changes in vegetation, hydrology, permafrost (e.g. frozen ground) etc.  The IEM integrates three different models: - the Alaska Frame-Based Ecosystem Code (ALFRESCO), which simulates wildland fire and vegetation establishment and growth; - the Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab model (GIPL), which simulates characteristics of soils, hydrology, vegetation, plant community composition, biomass, and carbon balance in soil; - and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) [which includes the Dynamic Vegetation (DVM) and Dynamic Organic Soil (DOS) models], which simulates permafrost (i.e. frozen ground) dynamics and changes.

This can potentially result in mismatches or asynchronies in food and habitat resources that negatively impact individual fitness, population dynamics, and ecosystem function. Numerous studies have evaluated phenological shifts in terrestrial species, particularly birds and plants, yet far fewer evaluations have been conducted for marine animals. This project seeks to improve our understanding of shifts in the timing of seasonal migration, spawning or breeding, and biological development (i.e. life stages present, dominant) of coastal fishes and migratory waterbirds along the U.S Atlantic coast. The suite of species selected will include ecologically important coastal predatory fishes that also support recreational and commercial fisheries such as striped bass, bluefish, and flounder; coastal migratory waterbirds of conservation concern such as plovers, terns, and egrets; and forage fishes such as herring and menhaden. Ideally the suite of species selected will allow us to compare whether fish and waterbird predators are shifting their phenology at different rates than their primary prey and optimal habitat conditions, thus influencing trophic interactions and population dynamics. Where sufficient long-term species observations and environmental monitoring data exist, the following questions will be evaluated using ecological modelling and statistical techniques: (1) Can phenological shifts of key coastal fish and waterbirds be detected and at what spatial and temporal scales? (2) What environmental variables are correlated with observed shifts in phenology? (3) Are there key attributes of species that appear to result in the presence or absence of phenological shifts? A comprehensive literature review will be conducted simultaneous to data collection and synthesis to determine what is known, and what knowledge/information/data gaps exist regarding regional phenological responses of coastal species to climate change. Project results will help managers assess the vulnerability of coastal species to climate change by providing information on how they are responding to impacts in the region.

Cheatgrass dominated areas experience more fires that burn more land than in native ecosystems, resulting in economic and resource losses. Therefore, the reduced production, or absence, of cheatgrass in previously invaded areas during years of adequate precipitation could be seen as a windfall. However, this cheatgrass dieoff phenomenon creates other problems for land managers like accelerated soil erosion, loss of early spring food supply for livestock and wildlife, and unknown recovery pathways. We used satellite data and scientific techniques to map annual estimated cheatgrass percent cover and areas of cheatgrass dieoff in the western and central parts of the northern Great Basin from 2000 - 2010. For this same area, we developed a map of cheatgrass percent cover variability and another map that displays cheatgrass dieoff probability.  These maps can assist land managers in understanding when and where cheatgrass did and did not exist over an extremely large landscape, and the maps can possibly explain characteristics of dieoff areas that can help researchers pinpoint the cause or causes of cheatgrass dieoff. The cheatgrass dieoff maps show that dieoff areas are spatially and temporally variable, or, in other words, a dieoff may afflict an area for a few years and then cheatgrass may return, only to dieoff again later. This pattern of variability can also persist in different areas. During the study period we estimated that, on average, about 2.6 million acres experienced cheatgrass dieoff annually.Restoring dieoff areas to a native ecosystem could be a goal of land managers, but until cheatgrass dieoff causes and natural recovery pathways are better understood, engaging in costly restoration activities may be unwise.

The findings will help inform the creation of a climate monitoring system and drought management plan, which are being supported with additional technical and financial support from the High Plains Regional Climate Center and NOAA\u2019s National Integrated Drought Information System. The drought plan will integrate climate science with hydrologic, social, and ecological vulnerabilities and risks, and identify response capacities and strategies to support the Tribal Water Code and related resources management. Ultimately, the plan will help the tribes ensure that agricultural and other societal needs are met during times of drought.   As part of the project, tribal water managers and the public will also be engaged in educational activities related to water resources and drought preparedness through joint activities with Wyoming Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research to build the tribes\u2019 ability to respond to future drought. Additionally, the Western Water Assessment at the University of Colorado-Boulder and the project team are evaluating team processes and outputs to document \u201clessons learned\u201d from the collaborative process to support the transfer of knowledge to other tribes and non-tribal entities in the region and beyond.

The Northern Rocky Mountain region is home to some of the last remaining interconnected habitats for many native fishes, including the threatened bull trout and native westslope cutthroat trout. The Northern Rockies are also experiencing rapidly changing climate conditions, with temperatures rising at twice the global average. These changes are having a range of impacts on aquatic ecosystems, including warming stream temperatures and changing streamflow regimes. This region is also experiencing a rise in the expansion of alien invasive fish species, which further threaten ecologically and economically valuable cold-water fish like trout and char.   The expansion of invasive species directly threatens regional economies, including Montana\u2019s recreational fishing industry, which brings an estimated $1 billion to the state\u2019s economy each year. Despite the implications of these shifts in fish communities, our understanding of how changes in climate might be facilitating the expansion of invasive species is limited, thereby restricting proactive resource management. So far, such expansion has led to observable differences in the productivity and biodiversity of fisheries across the Northern Rocky Mountains. Fisheries managers are increasingly aware of this problem and are faced with the difficult task of weighing trade-offs between preserving cold-water fisheries, and thereby aiding the conservation of native species, or shifting to recreational or warm-water fisheries, which are often comprised of non-native fish that can harm surrounding ecosystems but may also maintain the region\u2019s prized fishing industry.   The ultimate goal of this project is to assess the impacts of climate change on native and invasive fishes, fish communities, and user groups to help managers, anglers, and local governments anticipate the ecological and economic consequences of observable climatic changes in the Northern Rocky Mountains. Researchers will use long-term Montana fisheries data in conjunction with occupancy models to describe the geographic and seasonal expansion of invasive fishes throughout the region.

As warmer temperatures become more common, thawing of permafrost could have major consequences for Alaska. Where thawing has already occurred, dramatic changes in ecosystems and existing infrastructure are evident.  For example, thawing permafrost along the ocean shore and riverbanks in Northern Alaska is causing substantial coastal erosion and is impacting Native Alaska villages and threatening lives and properties.

To help provide this information, scientists are using the Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Model (IEM) to develop possible future scenarios of permafrost changes in the Alaskan Arctic and to estimate areas and rates of permafrost thaw and degradation.

Therefore, characterizing long term vegetation cycles can provide critical insight into how the behavior and health of a number of species may be altered due to climate change.   This project seeks to identify how drought conditions influence vegetation phenology, in order to better understand the potential effects on herbivores. Specifically, researchers will examine (1) if drought causes spring  green-up to occur earlier in the year; (2) if drought causes a shorter spring green-up period, thus reducing the window during which high-quality vegetation is available for herbivores; and (3) how the spatial patterns of plant productivity vary during drought years.   Identifying the effects of drought on vegetation will help wildlife managers better understand and predict changes in the behavior and health of herbivores during periods of drought. This information will be particularly important for wildlife managers in regions that are expected to experience increases in the frequency and severity of droughts due to climate change, such as the Southwest and North Central U.S\u2014regions that are home to a number of large herbivore species.

However, not all species and regions are changing at the same rate, which can lead to mismatches (e.g. between the emergence of plants and pollinators in early spring). Many interactions in nature depend on timing and, as such, phenology affects nearly all aspects of the environment, including the abundance, distribution, and diversity of organisms, ecosystem services, food webs, even global water and carbon cycles.   Phenology is among the best indicators of climate change impacts, in large part because phenological events are some of the most sensitive biological responses to environmental changes. Researchers are rapidly developing datasets, models, and indices that can improve our understanding of changing phenology. However, most indices of phenological change are poorly suited for water-limited ecosystems, and existing models are lacking in their ability to represent phenological change at local scales that are relevant and useful for decision making.   This project is a step towards addressing these limitations.

In contrast, montane spruce-fir forests in the White and Green Mountains of New England exhibited patterns of increasing abundance, potentially due to their recovery from the negative impacts of historic land use and pollution.

Every spring, hundreds of birds migrate to their summer breeding grounds in Alaska and northern Canada. Their arrival is timed with the height of the spring green-up of plants, which provide the food necessary for birds to reproduce and raise their young. However, over the last fifty years, warming temperatures in Alaska as a result of climate change have prompted an earlier transition from winter to spring. The purpose of this project was to examine whether there have been changes in the timing of spring green-up in recent years (1985-2009) and, if so, whether migratory birds are adapting their migration schedules accordingly.    Researchers used historical satellite imagery and long-term records on bird migration and breeding from across Alaska to generate a series of maps and publications to answer these questions. They found that bird species ranged widely in their adaptation to earlier spring, with some doing better than others at timing their arrival with changing temperature. The researchers also used downscaled climate models to project how bird habitat will be affected by climate change through the 21st century. This information can be used by Alaska land managers to focus their conservation efforts on species or habitat areas that appear especially vulnerable.   Collaborators in this project included the University of Alaska; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; National Park Service; Alaska Song Institute Fairbanks; North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management Barrow, Alaska; and U.S. National Forest Service.

Over the past century, however, populations have dramatically declined due to habitat loss, overharvest, and invasive species. Consequently, many populations are listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Complicating these stressors is global warming and associated climate change. Overall, aquatic ecosystems across the PNW are predicted to experience increasingly earlier snowmelt in the spring, reduced late spring and summer flows, increased winter flooding, warmer and drier summers, increased water temperatures, and expansion of invasive species. Understanding how effects of climate change might influence habitat for native salmonid populations is critical for effective management and recovery of these species. Scientists at the USGS and University of Montana used novel techniques and empirical data to study how climate change may drive landscape scale impacts that affect freshwater habitats and populations of key salmonid species (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and steelhead) throughout the PNW. Results showed strong linkages between climatic drivers (temperature and flow regimes) and the distribution, abundance, and genetic diversity of native salmonids across the PNW. Specifically, warming temperatures and shifting flow regimes are expected to fragment stream systems and cause salmonids to retreat upstream to headwater areas, thereby decreasing fish population abundance and genetic diversity, both of which are critical for persistence in a changing landscape. Climate-change\u2010induced periods of decreasing spring snowmelt and increases in stream temperatures are likely to decrease native biodiversity by fostering cross-breeding between invasive and native trout species. The study also developed a new framework for assessing the vulnerability of freshwater species to climate change and other stressors in complex stream networks, which will aid managers in proactively implementing conservation programs to increase resiliency and adaptive capacity of aquatic species.

Bull Trout Vulnerability Assessment:  This analysis was generated to show the relative vulnerability of bull trout across the Columbia basin. Input variables include the prportion of valley bottom (e.g. floodplains), the average max summer temperature (July 15th to Sept 15th), and winter flood frequency (the frequency of high flow events exceeding the 95th percentile from December through March) for a given watershed. The estimates for temperature and flow were taken from the mouth of the watershed. This analysis includes historic and future (2040s scenario). Stream temperature and flow data are avaliable at rap.ntsg.umt.edu.

Water Resources Research, 48, W11530 for information on stream temp and flow data.    2. Valley Bottoms:  Valley bottoms for the Columbia River were generated from an algorithm for Dave Nagel (USFS). See Nagel, D. E., J. M. Buffington, S. Parkes, S. J. Wenger, and J. R. Goode (2013) A landscape Scale Valley Confinement Algorithm: delineating unconfined valley bottoms for geomorphic, aquatic, and riparian applications. Page 42. RMRS-GTR-321. USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Boise, ID for more information. Input used to delineate the valley bottoms include a 30 m DEM and the NHD moderate resolution data.The algorithm estimates unconfined valley bottoms (UVB) from elevation and stream data in a GIS. We used the NHD streams and 30 m National Elevation Dataset (NED) data packaged with the NHD dataset. The UVB algorithm calculates a first-pass estimate of UVB using a GIS cost-distance approach (distance from stream times ground slope), and results are refined using a valley-filling procedure where a valley is \u201cflooded\u201d to a set flood height above the stream channel elevation. The flood height is set as a user-defined \u201cflood factor\u201d multiplied by bankfull depth. We used a flood factor of 6 in this analysis. The flood height is spread outward from the stream until it intersects a valley wall, and is further confined by a user-defined maximum ground slope (9%) and max valley width, which we set to 2000 m.  We used an annual mean precipitation value of 150 cm for the study area, and all other variables in the algorithm were set to defaults. Further details on the algorithm can be found in Nagel et al. (2014). We used the percent slope calculated as part of the UVB algorithm (using the 30 m NED data).

This project, jointly funded by the Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative, focused on the Methow River Basin in the arid east-central part of Washington State. The project team used data on fish growth, distribution, movement, food webs, river flow, and water temperature to develop a bioenergetics model and provide a complete picture of the habitat needs for bull trout. It also demonstrated that habitat connectivity is highly important for bull trout. The study showed that mountain whitefish in the Methow River moved up to 185 km from their natal stream areas, similar to the scale documented for bull trout. These large-scale movements are considered extremely important for diversity and resilience to environmental change. Loss of connectivity will be an increasing concern with rising stream temperatures and altered streamflows, and the project suggests that climate change impacts can be expected to affect major aspects of fish life.

This multi-year database (2011-2013) provides the ability to contrast years with wide variation in rainfall, winter ice-cover, and thermal stratification. In addition, multiple indicators of dietary and distributional responses to environmental variability will allow resource managers to select the most informative approach for addressing specific climate change questions.  Our results support the incorporation of some relatively simple and cost-efficient approaches into existing agency monitoring programs to track the near-term condition status of fish and fish community composition by functional groupings. Other metrics appear better suited for understanding longer-term changes, and may take more resources to implement on an ongoing basis. Although we hypothesized that dietary overlap and similarity in selected species would be sharply different during thermal stratification and hypoxic episodes, we found little evidence of this. Instead, to our surprise, this study found that fish tended to aggregate at the edges of hypoxia, highlighting potential spatial changes in catch efficiency of the fishery.  This work has had several positive impacts on a wide range of resource management and stakeholder activities, most notably in Lake Erie. The results were instrumental in the development of an interim decision rule for dealing with data collected during hypoxic events to improve stock assessment of Yellow Perch. In addition, novel findings from this study regarding spatial and temporal variability in hypoxia have aided US-Environmental Protection Agency in the development of a modified sampling protocol to more accurately quantify the central basin hypoxic zone, and this directly addressed a goal of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 2012 to reduce the extent and severity of hypoxia. Finally, the study areas developed in this project formed the basis for food web sampling in the 2014 bi-national Coordinated Science and Monitoring Initiative work in Lake Erie.  This project was co-funded by the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center and the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Landscape Conservation Cooperative.

Several climate-related factors are influencing Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s landscapes and contributing to these changes. These include climate change, climate variability, and drought (referred to collectively as CCVD). Climate variability describes how the climate fluctuates on a yearly basis around average values, while climate change describes patterns of long-term continuous change in the average.   While it is understood that CCVD will exert a growing influence on Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s ecosystems and communities, there is currently little information on the historic impacts of CCVD in the region. Improving our understanding of past conditions will help Hawai\u02c8i\u2019s natural resource managers better prepare for the future impacts of CCVD on ecosystems and communities. For example, invasive plant species in Hawai\u02c8i tend to be more fire-prone. If CCVD contributes to the spread of invasives, there may be more wildfires, and managers may need to revise current fire management strategies.   This project will use newly available datasets and tools to improve our understanding of the impacts of historic CCVD in Hawai\u02c8i. This information will then be used to assess the potential ecological and social impacts of CCVD, with an emphasis on fire risk.

To address this need, researchers are forecasting the effects of climate change on the distribution and abundance of sagebrush. Researchers will integrate several modeling approaches that take into account historical data, disturbances such as fire, and changes in temperature and precipitation.

Known as phenology, the timing of these events is very sensitive to changes in climate (and changes in one species\u2019 phenology can impact entire food webs and ecosystems). Shifts in phenology have been described as a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the temporal and spatial responses of wildlife to climate change impacts. Thus phenology provides one of the strongest indicators of the adaptive capacity of organisms (or the ability of organisms to cope with future environmental conditions).  In this study, researchers are exploring how the timing and occurrence of a number of highly migratory marine animals is changing due to a series of climatic and ecological shifts. First, using existing long-term historical data series, they will determine the direction and magnitude of how migration, abundance, or other phenological factors have changed for marine mammals, sea turtles, and fishes that migrate into the Gulf of Maine on a seasonal basis. Because marine animals are inherently difficult to detect, the team will apply dynamic occupancy models to evaluate seasonal migration patterns and habitat use across multiple habitats in the Gulf of Maine region. The project team will also synthesize regional information on a key, ecologically-important prey fish, sandlance, whose timing and abundance is a strong predictor of the occurrence and behavior of predator species targeted in this study as well as a range of other regional fish and wildlife of conservation and management concern. Results from this component of the project will identify coastal fish and wildlife species that are relatively more or less able to adapt and thus potentially vulnerable to climate change; determine the likely primary drivers of those changes; and identify data gaps and future monitoring needs. Ultimately, this information will be available and useful for regional coastal management and adaptation decisions that will allow managers to effectively plan for the future.   In a second component of the project, researchers will focus specifically on changes in migration patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale. While shifts in the distribution and time of recurring life events are adaptive responses that may help species cope with climate impacts, they can also lead to changes in how species interact with humans. The North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered whale species on the planet. In the North Atlantic Ocean, ship strikes and entanglements with commercial fishing gear represent fatal threats to right whales. Recent reports suggest that North Atlantic right whale migration patterns have changed. Many researchers posit that shifts in migration are responsible for recent increases in the overlap between right whales and human activities, especially fishing. To help understand how changes in right whale movements and behaviors may overlap with ship traffic, and thus put the animals at risk of encountering vessels, we will combine right whale habitat models with ship traffic maps. The end result will be a set of maps identifying risk levels.

We propose to quantify the effect of local factors and Pacific climate variability on the frequency of inundation events in centers of population and infrastructure in Pacific island communities. We will produce seasonal outlooks that project the number of incursions above a given level at a particular site in 3-6 month windows. We choose seasonal outlooks, because inundation events tend to cluster seasonally based on coastline orientation, storm tracks, dominant swell direction, and tidal amplitude. These same principles will then be applied to quantify how often severe inundation seasons are likely to occur given longer term changes related to natural and anthropogenic climate change.

In the United States, the ecosystem services provided by wetlands are worth billions of dollars and include flood protection, erosion control, seafood, water quality enhancement, carbon storage, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Unfortunately, these ecosystems are also highly sensitive to changing climate conditions. Past research on climate impacts to coastal wetlands have concentrated primarily on sea-level rise, largely ignoring the important influence of changing temperature and precipitation patterns. Understanding the impact of temperature and precipitation on coastal wetlands can help natural and cultural resource managers account for these factors when making decisions or developing adaptation plans.  This study advances understanding of how temperature and precipitation influence coastal wetland ecosystems. The study models the relationships between wetland plant community structure and climate in the northern Gulf of Mexico and identifies potential impacts of future climate conditions on these ecosystems. The researchers identify critical ecological thresholds and demonstrate that transformative ecological changes due to climatic shifts are probable throughout the Gulf of Mexico within this century. In certain areas, small changes in temperature or rainfall are expected to trigger large ecological changes and affect certain ecosystem services. Because coastal wetland ecosystems in other parts of the world are also sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, the findings of this research have global implications, helping to inform the management of these highly valuable ecosystems under a changing climate.

The gopher tortoise is a \u201ckeystone\u201d species, meaning that its disappearance from the landscape would jeopardize the existence of many other species that make use of its underground burrows.  Besides tortoise habitat, the uplands of the Coastal Plain contain isolated seasonal wetlands that are important for the life cycles of many amphibian species. The state of Georgia would like to conserve more of the landscape for the statewide protection of the gopher tortoise and associated natural communities.

Given the importance of recreational fishing, using such a figure to summarize national inland fisheries production is misleading. The goal of this project is to improve national estimates of inland recreational harvest to ensure that the important economic, social, and cultural services provided by inland angling are not discounted. To achieve this goal, researchers will (1) compile angler survey data for inland water bodies from all 50 states; (2) develop a model of recreational harvest; (3) identify ways in which inland harvest might be expected to change as a result of changes in climate and land use; and (4) collaborate with state fisheries managers to help build their understanding of inland angling trends and to standardize national inland fisheries reporting to the FAO.

Despite concerns about increasing fire severity, mapping of fire refugia and stand-replacing fire has not been completed for old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest, hindering conservation planning for threatened and endangered species.  To address this need, researchers will map the probability of fire refugia and stand-replacing fire, based on topographic conditions, fire weather, fuel loads, and climate.

To address this immediate need, researchers are examining whether a common forest management tool, prescribed fire, can be implemented to help forests better survive drought.   Prescribed fire is commonly used in the western U.S. to remove potential wildfire fuel, such as small trees and shrubs. It is also thought that this act of selectively removing some trees helps the remaining trees better survive drought events, because there is less competition for water. However, the proposition that prescribed burning could improve forest resistance to drought has never been formally tested. By comparing the survivorship of trees in burned and unburned forest monitoring plots in drought-impacted areas, researchers will determine (a) whether prescribed fire is an effective tool for improving forest resistance to drought, and (b) whether factors such as time since fire and tree species and size influence a forest\u2019s degree of resistance.   In the face of ongoing climate change and projected future drought conditions in the West, this study will help land managers make informed decisions on how to best allocate limited climate change adaptation funds.

This research contributes to generating more reliable local-scale climate projections by testing the assumption that the climatological relationships which existed in the past will continue to exist in the future. To do this, researchers developed a novel approach in which very high-resolution climate model data were used as a surrogate for historical and future \"observations\", allowing researchers to test how well the more commonly-used coarse-scale global climate models project future climate conditions.  Findings suggest that the assumption holds reasonably well in many cases, but there are some instances (for example in particular geographic locations, such as coastal regions, and at certain times of year, especially summer) when the assumption is not as robust. This research also explores the conditions under which the assumption does not hold, and develops ways to make the methods used to generate local information about climate change more reliable.

However, effective two-way conversations between scientists and stakeholders are often limited, due to resource constraints, a lack of necessary communication skills and tools, and other factors.   A mechanism for better communication between scientists and stakeholders is needed to facilitate the successful exchange of scientific information. This project aims to address this need by developing the ScienceTapes project, an initiative to record and archive conversations between research scientists and non-scientists in order to share science stories to build connections between people, science, and the environment to create a greater understanding of change in Alaska\u2019s llandscapes.   The project team is partnering with StoryCorps and has trained a group of volunteers to facilitate effective conversations between two people. The volunteers then participated in facilitating, recording and archiving the conversations. Since the initial training period ScienceTapes has set up listening stations at events and conferences across Alaska. The team has facilitated over 60 conversations, with 49 currently archived with StoryCorps and the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. ScienceTapes has recorded conversations with a wide-array of people, including research scientists, students ( from elementary to graduate level), decision makers, resource managers, engineers, rural community members, politicians, Alaskan elders (rural and urban), film makers, and media personnel.    Several of the recordings from the first year have been processed into shorter pieces that can be accessed on the project\u2019s pilot website (www.sciencetapes.org). The project coordinators also intend to create a model for science communication that can be applied to a variety of other science communication needs in the larger science community. As the ScienceTapes team moves past its collaboration and partnership with StoryCorps, the focus of the project will be expanded.

Maintaining connectivity between habitats and wildlife populations will be a key management strategy for conserving biodiversity in the region into the future.  Previous work by the research team modeled and mapped connectivity in the Southeast for three animals that inhabit bottomland forests, and showed where key connections in the landscape lie both currently and in the future. However, the researchers observed large variation in connectivity across geographical areas, time periods, and species. These results raised new questions about which connections are most important for management actions.  This project is building on this previous research with four approaches: 1) analyze consistency between this work and other connectivity efforts; 2) asses trade-offs between current and future connectivity; 3) extend work on the prioritization of core habitat areas and central points of connectivity; and 4) optimize the selection of sites for conservation action at the local scale. This project will have a regional focus of bottomland hardwoods, but will also extend to include longleaf pine forests.

This is not entirely surprising given that the three measures assess different aspects of vulnerability and are based on different types of information.

change, yet its documented impacts on biodiversity remain uncertain and complex. Although there have been many published studies on species shifting their geographic ranges in response to climate change, it is still challenging to identify the specific mechanisms and conditions that facilitate range shifts in some species and not in others. In addition, it can be difficult to disentangle climate-induced range shifts from other environmental changes which can also result in range shifts (such as changes to land use or habitat).  This project attempts to address these knowledge gaps by conducting a systematic literature review of documented cases of species\u2019 range shifts in response to climate change. The project researchers are evaluating empirical evidence of climate-driven range shifts in the context of commonly-held hypotheses: i.e., that species will shift their range towards the poles and towards higher elevations. Conducting this analysis will enable the scientists to assess their overall confidence in these hypotheses, and to understand why some species conform to these expectations while others do not. Given the critical management importance of understanding where species will be distributed across the landscape in the future, this project will support more science-based decision-making, which can inform a range of climate adaptation and wildlife management strategies.

This project used a dynamic vegetation model to simulate vegetation type (grassland, shrubland, woodland, and forest) for the NGP for a range of projected future climates and relevant management scenarios. Comparing results of these simulations illustrates the sensitivity of woody encroachment projections to climate change factors.

Output variables provided as decadal averages are live aboveground tree carbon, tree leaf area index, soil available water for plant survival, surface runoff, potential evapotranspiration, streamflow, and actual evapotranspiration.

The depressional wetlands in this region (wetlands located in topographic depressions where water can accumulate) are an important source of surface water during the summer months. However, their health depends directly on precipitation and evaporation, making them susceptible to changes in temperature and precipitation. Yet few tools for monitoring water movement patterns (hydrology) in and out of these landscapes currently exist, hindering efforts to model how they are changing.   This project provided data on wetland locations, historical hydrologic dynamics, and projected climate change impacts by analyzing flooding and drying patterns for thousands of wetlands in the Columbia Plateau from 1984 to 2011. The data describes the change between historical and future projected wetland patterns across the region. Researchers found that wetlands in the region will respond differently to projected changes in climate. Groundwater-driven wetlands, which tend to be more permanently flooded, may see increases in water levels and dry less frequently. Surface-water-driven wetlands, which flood seasonally, may see a decrease in surface-water levels, dry more frequently, and dry earlier in the season.   Understanding how changes in climate could impact depressional wetland dynamics is critical for sustainable management and conservation in dry areas like the Columbia Plateau. To ensure usability, researchers provided guidance on using the data to federal and state agencies, tribes, universities, and nonprofit organizations, such as Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge, Foster Creek Conservation District, and the Natural Resources Department of Yakama Nation.

There is also a need for a process to effectively evaluate projects that no longer resemble standard academic research because they integrate decision-makers in a full and collaborative manner.   The project researchers have developed a framework for the evaluation of collaboratively produced climate science that specifically addresses the process of producing and outcomes of actionable science. Through this project, the team is using this framework to evaluate a sample of projects funded by the Southwest CSC to determine: 1) To what extent the science is being applied to management decisions in the Southwest region, 2) What the barriers are to the use of science, and 3) Which practices or strategies are most associated with the production of actionable science.

We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100. We were able to develop good predictive models of how warming influences beneficial and pest insects for cities in the Southeast and across the east coast more generally.

In addition, by comparing our results to those we garnered from herbarium specimens (many insects can be found on herbarium specimens) we could show that the effects of urban warming match those of climate change through time. In short, a subset of pests is likely to get far worse with warming and this effect is likely to be most pronounced in the Southeast. A second body of work built on these discoveries to consider how to protect trees and forests from the pests that do better with warming.

To respond to this need, the Northwest Boreal Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NWBLCC) has launched the Northwest Boreal Science and Management Research Tool. This tool allows users to search by keyword and geography to find relevant documents across the boreal region. With this tool, users can explore thousands of curated peer-reviewed scholarly journal articles, state and federal government resource reports, land use management plans, graduate student dissertations and theses and more. Each entry includes geographic information about the area of study, allowing users to draw a box on a map to narrow searches to information directly related to a specific region in Alaska, the Yukon, British Columbia, and Northwest Territories.   Researchers are now working to publicize and deliver the tool to land use managers and Alaska Native Tribes within the NWBLCC region. The researchers plan to inform climate adaptation planning by presenting the scientific information and tool at local conferences, state-wide webinars, and integrating the tool into future research projects.", "proj_items": {}, "num_items": 0}, "5bc4ba39e4b0fc368eba0489": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5bc4ba39e4b0fc368eba0489", "proj_phrases": ["interior", "available science", "motivate residents", "science center", "sea-level rise", "southeast climate adaptation science center", "u.s.", "wildlife agency partners", "natural resource decision makers", "future urbanization", "anticipate hotspots", "vast coastline", "wildlife service", "recent", "region \u2019", "habitat change scenarios", "facility management decisions", "information", "secretarial priority", "potential future urban change", "southeast", "southeastern u.s.", "comprehensive scenarios", "climate warms", "wildlife", "region \u2019 s wildlife", "human populations", "coastal areas", "other department", "habitat change", "risky inland locations", "fws", "state fish", "fish", "u.s", "regulatory obligations", "climate adaptation", "southeast u.s.", "arguably", "population movement", "rural lands", "region \u2019 s population", "natural resource managers plan", "favorable winter climate", "best available science", "support secretarial priority 1a", "state wildlife action plans", "national park service", "climate change", "interior bureaus", "southeast region", "potential patterns", "long-lasting modification", "rapid population growth", "species status assessments", "future urbanization patterns"], "avg_item_sim": 0, "proj_summary": "Arguably the most direct, intense, and long-lasting modification that humans can make to a landscape is converting rural lands to urbanized areas. As human populations grow, the demand for urbanized areas will increase, and scientists can help natural resource managers plan for these changes by creating models that predict potential patterns of future urbanization. The Southeast U.S. is experiencing particularly rapid population growth, as a favorable winter climate has drawn millions to the region from other areas of the country over the past several decades. However, the Southeast is also at risk from the effects of climate change, particularly along its vast coastline, where over a quarter of the region\u2019s population lives. Recent studies have called attention to the potential for flooding from sea-level rise to motivate residents to move from low-lying coastal areas to less risky inland locations at higher elevation. To date, no research has explicitly considered how the existing flow of people into the region will interact with the potentially increasing drive to move away from the coast.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service, and state fish and wildlife agency partners have requested that the Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center provide updated urbanization and habitat change scenarios to meet regulatory obligations, as species status assessments and state wildlife action plans, and make facility management decisions. This project will build on prior efforts to develop more comprehensive scenarios of future urbanization patterns in the southeastern U.S. These scenarios will take into account two potentially counteracting phenomenon: 1) an increasing redistribution of people from coastal and low-lying areas as they become more vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and 2) existing migration flows from other parts of the country into the Southeast, which also could change as the climate warms.  The resulting scenarios and maps of potential future urban change will allow natural resource decision makers to visualize and anticipate hotspots of urbanization and population movement across the Southeast in the coming decades. Information on the combined effects of urbanization and climate change can help inform management of the region\u2019s wildlife, ecosystems, and habitats of concern.

Since 2011, Suicide Basin has been collecting melt- and rainwater each summer, creating a temporary glacier-dammed lake. Water that accumulates typically gets released through channels that run beneath the glacier. These channels are normally blocked by ice, but if the water pressure gets too high the channel breaks open, rapidly draining the basin in what is known as an \u201coutburst flood\u201d. In past years, these events have led to flooding along Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River in the most heavily populated neighborhood of Juneau.   Because of the threats posed to infrastructure in the Mendenhall Valley, it is critical that scientists closely monitor and forecast outburst flood events. The goal of this project is to design a tool to improve forecasting of the timing and flood peak associated with outburst events from Suicide Basin. The forecasting tool will be web-interfaced and provide real-time monitoring data from a USGS streamflow gage in Suicide Basin. After the onset of an outburst flood event, the web tool will also provide continuously updated forecasts of the flood peak (including timing) that will be used by the National Weather Service and the City and Borough of Juneau to warn the public about closures and threats to life and property. Accurate forecasts will improve the process of initiating and implementing closures and evacuations in the Mendenhall Valley.

Already, residents are facing extreme high tides and 16 foot swells that flood the islands with saltwater, damaging homes and infrastructure and contaminating the freshwater supply.  Land elevation is the primary factor that determines the vulnerability of coastal areas to inundation. This project builds on previous work in which a 1-meter resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was developed for Majuro Atoll, home to the capital and largest city in the Marshall Islands. Researchers will use this DEM to map areas of Majuro Atoll that are vulnerable to inundation, based on different water level scenarios. For example, these maps can be used to answer the question of which areas would flood should seas rise by 0.4, 0.8, or 1 meter, and will represent the first detailed assessment of sea-level rise vulnerability for Majuro.  The results of this project will support assessments of how future inundation events could impact ecosystems, infrastructure, the freshwater supply, and agroforestry on Majuro Atoll.

In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands, where the ocean meets the land, are highly productive areas that support a wealth of wildlife species from salmon to ducks. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. However, wetlands in this region and elsewhere are threatened by sea-level rise and other climate-related changes. According to a USFWS and NOAA report, between 2004 and 2009, 80,000 acres of wetland were lost on average each year, which is a significant increase from the previous six years.  While we know that these coastal ecosystems are already changing, we know comparatively less about how these areas might continue to change over the next 50 to 100 years. The goal of this project was to provide scientific information that will support long-term coastal planning and conservation efforts in the face of changing climate conditions. Researchers looked at the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon. They compiled data on coastal terrain, tidal flooding, vegetation, and how quickly sediments accumulate, to assess how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Researchers found that factors such as elevation, sediments, and rate of sea-level rise can all affect marsh resilience. Importantly, researchers found that while most of the tidal marsh study sites will be able to persist in the face of sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, sea-level rise could eventually outpace the growth of marshes and drown most high and mid-elevation marsh habitats by 2110.", "proj_items": {"5af4cc2ce4b0da30c1b44f6b": {"item_summary": "We used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenariosIn WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Csdating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms,at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1.Organic matterWe used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction by estimating a rate of decrease in porosity from the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort.Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than one year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Bandon marsh with the projection from the WARMER model for the year 2010 with a 63 cm sea-level rise rate. In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.", "avg_sim": 0.6318, "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5af4cc2ce4b0da30c1b44f6b", "weighted_sim": 0.6259, "item_phrases": ["percent organic

positioning system (GPS) surveys between 2009 and 2014 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).The feature class contains elevation surveys conducted at the CERCC Bandon marsh study site. At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon).

Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon. We performed bathymetric surveys using a shallow-water echo-sounding system comprised of an acoustic profiler, Leica Viva RTK GPS, and laptop computer mounted on a shallow-draft, portable flat-bottom boat. The RTK GPS enabled high resolution elevations of the water surface. The rover positions were received from the Leica Smartnet system (www.lecia-geosystems.com) or base station and referenced to the same bench mark used in the elevation surveys. We mounted a variable frequency transducer on the front of the boat and connected it to the sounder; the sounder worked in areas of &gt;10 cm of water. We recorded twenty depth readings and one GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences. The bar-check plate was suspended below the transducer at a known depth that was verified against the transducer readings. We synthesized the bathymetry data to create a digital elevation model (DEM) of the nearshore regions at Port Susan, Skokomish, Nisqually, Grays Harbor, Willapa, and Bull Island using ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size). We removed portions of bathymetry data that overlapped with elevation surveys conducted on the tidal marsh. We present elevation data as local orthometric heights (NAVD88). At Padilla we mapped the nearshore area using the methodologies outlined in the project report as the dense eelgrass beds would have increased the error in acoustic measurements At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services.

Transects for core sampling were determined in ArcGIS, using a digitial elevation model and site-specific tidal datums to choose station locations below MHW (low), between MHW and MHHW (mid), and above MHHW (high). Sediment cores were 50 cm deep and 5 cm in diameter. In the lab, we cut cores into 1 cm sections to process for bulk density, porosity, and organic matter composition using loss on ignition in a muffle furnace at 550&ordm;C for 8 hr. Only half of the cores collected were processed for bulk density, organic matter and Cesuim dating (one replicate). We used Cesium-137 (137Cs) isotope dating techniques to determine accumulation rates in deep soil cores. Atmospheric nuclear testing prior to 1964 resulted in the spread of 137Cs across the globe creating a reliable marker horizon in soils. We used a gamma spectrometer at the Oregon State University Radiation Center to detect 137Cs activity, measured in picocuries (pCi), in 1 cm core samples for 24 hr. We standardized the 137Cs activity of each sample to its mass. The depth of the 137Cs peak activity indicated the 1964 marker horizon, which we used to determine average soil accretion rates over the last half century. Not every processed core had a distinct peak of Cesium 137.

We visually assessed percent cover of all plant species within a 0.25 m2 quadrat, and recorded the average and maximum height (measured to the nearest centimeter) of each species. Total plant cover in a plot could exceed 100% due to vegetation layering. Vascular plant nomenclature generally follows Baldwin et al. (2012) and Cook et al. (2013). We located 69 tidal wetland species in 2,154 vegetation plots across the nine estuaries in the study. Common species included Carex lyngbyei, Sarcocornia perennis, Distichlis spicata, Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus balticus and Potentilla anserina. The frequency of several common species varied markedly across the sites. Distichlis spicata dominated the flora at five of the nine sites, but was relatively uncommon at Port Susan and Grays Harbor. Deschampsia cespitosa, a middle to high marsh tussock-forming species was frequent at the three Oregon sites and at Willapa but much less common in Puget Sound marshes. The high marsh rush, Juncus balticus, was most frequent at Siletz and absent or rare at Willapa and Padilla. Carex lyngbyei occurrence was variable regionally, ranging from &gt;75% frequency at Bull Island to near absence at Padilla (it did not occur in any surveyed plots, but a few plants were observed at the upland margin of the site in late 2014). See appendices for detailed site specific results. We delineated marsh zones using long-term NOAA tidal data combined with our site-specific elevation and water level data and examined plant abundance in these major zones across the sites. At many sites, plant composition tended to vary by zone, but not necessarily in consistent ways across the region. For instance, at Bandon, Sarcocornia perennis was the most abundant high marsh species (with Deschampsia cespitosa most abundant in middle and low marsh), while S. perennis was the most abundant plant in low marsh at Grays Harbor (Carex spp. dominated in mid-marsh and Potentilla anserina dominated high marsh). Vertical zonation of plant assemblages was less pronounced at other sites, including Nisqually where Distichlis spicata had the highest mean cover in all three major marsh zones. Low marsh habitat was common at Bull Island, Willapa, Nisqually, and Port Susan. Common species in this zone included Sarcocornia perennis, Distichlis spicata, Carex lyngbyei, and Triglochin maritima. Middle tidal marsh was present at all of the sites and particularly common at Skokomish. Common species included all of the aforementioned taxa and Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus balticus, and Agrostis stolonifera. High marsh was only common at Bandon, Siletz, Willapa, Grays Harbor, and Padilla. Common high marsh species included many species found in other zones, but also included Potentilla anserine and Atriplex prostrata. Transition zone habitat (defined as wetland flooding at least once per year but no more than once per month) was limited at most of our study sites. Zonation of individual species per site are illustrated in the respective appendices. In the Pacific Northwest, coastal wetlands support a wealth of ecosystem services including habitat provision for wildlife and fisheries and flood protection. The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.", "avg_sim": 0.6247, "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55b2db24e4b09a3b01b5d9da", "weighted_sim": 0.6184, "item_phrases": ["juncus balticus",

inundation patterns and calculate site-specific tidal datums, we deployed water level data loggers (Model 3001, Solinst Canada Ltd., Georgetown, Ontario, Canada and Model U-20-001-01-Ti, Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA, USA) at all sites over the study period. Each site had one or two loggers (n = 16). We placed loggers at the mouth and upper reaches of second-order tidal channels to capture high tides and determine seasonal inundation patterns. Water loggers collected water level readings every six minutes starting on the date of deployment and continuing to the present. We used data from the lowest elevation logger at each site to develop local hydrographs and inundation rates. We surveyed loggers with RTK GPS at the time of deployment and at each data download that occurred quarterly, to correct for any vertical movement. We corrected all raw water level data with local time series of barometric pressure. For Solinst loggers, we deployed independent barometric loggers (Model 3001, Solinst Canada Ltd., Georgetown, Ontario, Canada); for Hobo water level loggers, we used barometric pressure from local airports (distance less than 10 miles). To determine tidal channel salinities, we deployed one conductivity logger at each site next to the lower elevation water level logger (Odyssey conductivity/temperature logger, Dataflow Systems Pty Limited, Christchurch, New Zealand). We converted specific conductance values obtained with the Odyssey loggers to practical salinity units using the equation from UNESCO (1983). We used water level data to estimate local tidal datums for all sites using procedures outlined in the NOAA Tidal Datums Handbook (NOAA, 2003). We only calculated local MHW and MHHW because the loggers were positioned in the intertidal, which is relatively high in the tidal frame, and therefore did not capture MLW or MLLW and could not be used to compute these lower datums. We estimated mean tide level (MTL) for each site by using NOAA\u2019s VDATUM 3.4 software (vdatum.noaa.gov), except at Bandon where we used MTL directly from historic NOAA data. Many results in this report are reported relative to local MHHW calculated from local water data. Water level loggers deployed within marsh channels recorded variation in water levels and salinity throughout the study duration. Loggers often did not capture lower portions of the tidal curve because of their location in tidal marsh channels which frequently drain at lower tides. From peak water levels, we calculated site-specific tidal datums (MHW and MHHW), and information on the highest observed water level (HOWL) during the time series. Our site specific tidal datum calculations generally closely matched tidal datums computed at nearby NOAA stations (tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). Differences likely reflect site-specific tidal and bathymetric conditions in local estuarine hydrology. We collected salinity data at all sites, however, due to equipment recalls and failure we do not have salinity data for the duration of the study. We report weekly maximum salinities since many of our salinity loggers were not submerged during the entire tidal cycle at all sites, except for Grays Harbor due to recalled loggers and loggers being washed away during storm events. We observed a high level of variation in salinity between and within sites. Siletz experienced the greatest variation in salinity during the study period, ranging from 0.8 to 32 ppt. Willapa was the freshest system, ranging from 12-15 ppt and had very little temporal variation. The largest variation in salinity at most sites occurred from September through December. All sites had salinity below 35 ppt throughout most of the year; however, the highest salinities were measured in August. See appendices for detailed site specific results. At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions.

"5af4afdae4b0da30c1b44f0b": {"item_summary": "To assess the current topography of tidal marsh at the study sites we conducted survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) surveys between 2009 and 2014 using a Leica RX1200 Real Time Kinematic (RTK) rover (\u00b11 cm horizontal, \u00b12 cm vertical accuracy; Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA; Figure 4). At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system via a CDMA modem (www.lecia-geosystems.com). At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station via radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (Figure 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS. To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (Appendix Figs. A1 \u2013 I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (m, NAVD88; North American Vertical Datum of 1988) and projected all points to NAD83 UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Inc, Norcross, GA).In ArcGIS 10.2.1 Spatial Analyst (ESRI 2013, Redlands, CA), we created a digital elevation model (DEM) for each site using each sites survey elevation data points. We processed the elevation point data with exponential ordinary kriging methods (5 x 5 m cell size) while adjusting model parameters to minimize the root-mean-square (RMS) error to create the best model fit for the DEM (Table 2). We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones. At the state level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services. The information emerging from our CERCC network will provide local managers and decision makers with the information they need to address endangered and threatened species management, wetland conservation, anadromous fish and migratory bird management and habitat conservation and recovery plans while making informed decisions on habitat resiliency and land acquisition planning that effectively considers the effects of climate change. Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon). Each study site comprised a portion of the tidal marsh and adjacent nearshore ecosystem. Although the entire Washington and Oregon coasts have a temperate climate, the sites spanned a broad range of hydrologic and oceanographic conditions. Overall tidal range decreased from northern Washington to southern Oregon.", "avg_sim": 0.6204, "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5af4afdae4b0da30c1b44f0b", "weighted_sim": 0.611,

widespread forest pest outbreaks. As a result, land managers are becoming increasingly concerned about how climate change is affecting natural resources and the essential services they provide communities.   The rates and ecological impacts of changing conditions vary across this diverse region, which stretches from the Great Plains to the High Rockies. The goal of this project is to understand how native grasslands, shrublands, and forests will respond to changing conditions. Researchers will first model how these vegetation types have changed over the past 50 years, then will project how they might change over the next century under different possible future conditions.   Understanding how these native ecosystems may change is critical, particularly in light of the wildlife and communities that depend on them. Species such as the greater sage-grouse, elk, deer, and grizzly bears could lose important habitat if conditions change. Humans could also be impacted \u2013 subalpine forests, for example, control snow accumulation and melt, which in turn affect the water supply. The results of this research will be used to support local stakeholders in developing strategies for coping with and adapting to projected changes in vegetation across the North Central region.

In order to help connect the landscape-scale conservation activities of the LCC network with its climate science capacity, the NC CSC has worked with four regional LCCs and its University Consortium to establish liaison teams.  These liaison teams will focus communication efforts between LCC and NC CSC leadership to enhance development of collaborative work, integrating climate science with management needs to result in cogenerated information. These liaisons will help leverage the existing efforts and expertise of the USGS, staff at the NC CSC, and the NC CSC University Consortium to more directly contribute climate science collaboration and support to priority LCC activities and topics.  The objective of this collaboration is to focus on increased engagement and communication, as called for in the National Academy of Science review of the LCCs, to 1) take advantage of the LCCs\u2019 existing and ongoing distillation of partner needs and 2) bring to bear on those needs existing NC CSC and USGS climate related science.

This project examined the decision making context, decision making process, and management planning associated with the restoration of open pine ecosystems in the Southeast. To better understand the planning practice associated with this system, we assessed the quality of 35 management plans from federal, state, and non-governmental agencies. We found that newer plans scored higher than older plans, suggesting agencies may be learning to develop better plans over time and indicating older plans should be prioritized for revision. Plans from federal and state agencies scored higher than plans from non-governmental agencies, reflecting differences in agency missions and resources. The fact base scored high across most plans, whereas actions and implementation scored lower. Although agencies tended to perform best on fact base, our results suggest having a strong fact base has little influence on other components. To improve actions and implementation, planners should consider incorporating more stakeholder participation to help them develop better actions and implementation indirectly through improved problem and objective statements.  We also investigated how decisions were being made and what barriers - if any - faced decision makers. To gain this insight, we conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with key decision makers and stakeholders and our findings emphasized the challenge of collaboration between individuals, governmental, and non-governmental organizations. We found discrepancies between groups on everything from objectives and goals, to how decisions are made, the barriers groups are facing, information that is used to make those decisions and where information comes from as well as differences in decision making timing and frequency. Agency managers had firm objectives while landowners/private land managers had flexible objectives that changed based on new goals, knowledge and information. In the same vein, agency managers said it was hard to change their management plans but landowners/private land managers said that their management plans were constantly changing to meet their shifting objectives. Agency managers reported that they had access to all of the information they needed to make \u201cgood\u201d decisions while landowners/private managers said that they wanted and needed more information, specifically better economic and growth data. And although agency managers said climate change was a factor when making decisions, landowners/private land managers said that climate change was not a decision making factor. To bridge the gap between the two groups and increase information sharing, a library of regulatory requirements, scientific data, personal experiences and fiscal information may be a way to align management objectives and goals.  Lastly, we developed a questionnaire that may be used in future research projects to evaluate how socio-structural drivers and the personas of decision makers influence their decision making.

Although some variability in fish catches is expected across factors such as location and season, we know less about how large-scale disturbances like climate change will influence population variability.  The Laurentian Great Lakes in North America are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world, and they have experienced major changes due to fluctuations in pollution and nutrient loadings, exploitation of natural resources, introductions of non-native species, and shifting climatic patterns.  In this project, we analyzed established long-term data about important fish populations from across the Great Lakes basin, including from Oneida Lake in NY, Lake Michigan, and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Our objective was to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in fish catches from large freshwater lakes that have experienced large-scale changing conditions.  We evaluated analytical approaches with the potential to disentangle sources of variability in standardized monitoring data.  Specifically, we considered 1) how the decomposition of spatial and temporal variation in fish catches can be used to measure a response to perturbation; 2) how truncation of population age structure can alter population oscillations which may shift how a population is affected by environmental fluctuations; and 3) how the composition of a fish community may respond to a suite of environmental drivers through time. Using long-term gill-net data for walleye, we found that average catch and variance structure differed before and after large-scale perturbations. More generally, our results suggest that fish population responses to changing environments can be complex, but that long-term monitoring combined with modeling approaches can allow for detection of quantifiable changes.", "proj_items": {"5977615ce4b0ec1a4888e095": {"item_summary": "This data package contains tables summarizing data collected during standardized gill net sampling conducted since 1957 and is part of the collection \"Cornell Oneida Lake Data\".

As water levels drop, some small streams become fragmented, transforming from a ribbon of continuous habitat into a series of isolated pools. Fragmented streams may pose a serious threat to salmon. For example, juveniles that become stranded in small pools are at increased risk to overheat, starve, or be consumed by predators.  Healthy salmon populations can cope with fragmentation and recover from a bad drought-year. However, many salmon populations are endangered and face long-term drought. Land and resource managers are increasingly finding endangered salmon stranded in fragmented habitats, facing what is presumed to be certain death. Desperate to help, a small group of managers and conservation stewards are experimenting with fish rescue, capturing juvenile salmon from fragmented habitats and moving them to hatchery-like facilities until they grow large enough to go to sea.  There are growing demands to expand fish rescue programs, however no one has actually evaluated whether it is safe, effective, or feasible at scales that would have meaningful impact. This project aims to measure the effects of fish rescue at multiple life-stages and analyze the costs and benefits of applying this technique across the Northwest. The final product will be a tool that allows natural resource managers to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of fish rescue in the context of their specific watershed and salmon population.

This is because a primary way in which species respond to climate change is by adjusting their geographic ranges to find more suitable temperatures and adequate food supplies. It is also because connectivity facilitates many other important ecological and evolutionary processes within species' ranges, further promoting resilience and healthy populations. However, widespread fragmentation of landscapes by human activities presents a serious obstacle to these processes, which may contribute to a decline in biodiversity, and subsequent declines in the many services healthy ecosystems provide, such as clean air and water.  In order to address the need for effective connectivity management in the face of climate change, scientists teamed with land managers in the transboundary region of British Columbia and Washington State to apply the best available science directly to the information needs of those seeking to manage connectivity. The scientists and managers used conceptual models to understand and project a wide range of future impacts to connectivity for 13 case studies. They also identified a diverse set of adaptation responses to address connectivity. For example, managers might implement prescribed burns, control invasive species, or restore riparian areas to maintain existing core habitat areas and their connections.

Techniques were incorporated to accommodate a large number of classes and to predict the future occurrence of climates beyond the contemporary climatic range of the biomes. Errors of prediction from the statistical model averaged 3.7%, but for individual biomes, ranged from 0% to 21.5%. In validating the ability of the model to identify climates without analogs, 78% of 1528 locations outside North America and 81% of land area of the Caribbean Islands were predicted to have no analogs among the 46 biomes. Biome climates were projected into the future according to low and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios of three General Circulation Models  (cgcm, hadley, and consensus) for three periods, the decades surrounding 2030, 2060, and 2090. Prominent in the projections were (1) expansion of climates suitable for the tropical dry deciduous forests of Mexico, (2) expansion of climates typifying desertscrub biomes of western USA and northern Mexico, (3) stability of climates typifying the evergreen\u2013deciduous forests of eastern USA, and (4) northward expansion of climates suited to temperate forests, Great Plains grasslands, and montane forests to the detriment of taiga and tundra climates. Maps indicating either poor agreement among projections or climates without contemporary analogs identify geographic areas where land management programs would be most equivocal. Concentrating efforts and resources where projections are more certain can assure land managers a greater likelihood of success.  Because General Circulation Models (GCM) are key to understanding future climates, the tool we envision must take into account the variability in GCM output resulting from different model formulations and emissions scenarios. However, to land managers, variation represents uncertainty, and uncertainty often leads to inaction. Our approach was to emphasize similarities in responses projected from the disparate formulations rather than dwell on the differences. The tool must also contain provisions for identifying future climates with no contemporary analog because new climates may best be suited for species assemblages that do not exist today. To be useful, the scope of a vegetation model should be neither too broad to constrain local interpretation nor so parochial as to limit management options. It is mandatory, moreover, that this tool incorporates powerful statistical techniques that retain the robustness and flexibility necessary for anticipating and accommodating actual changes.  Our analysis uses the biotic communities of Brown (1994), mapped and digitized by Brown et al. (1998). This classification system meshes well with our goals: It is based on distributions of flora and fauna without reliance on physiography, the coverage includes all of North America, and altitudinal zonation of vegetation is an integral part of the system. For simplicity, we use the term \"biome\" to reference the biotic communities. Previous analyses used this classification system for modeling climatic control of biome distributions in western USA. These analyses produced errors of fit (~10%) that largely resulted from an imperfect alignment between digitized polygons in the classification system and the digital elevation model used to generate point estimates of biome climates. Misalignment had greatest impact at borders of polygons, along shore lines, and on mountain peaks, and therefore, was of greatest source of error with small, irregularly shaped polygons and for biomes occurring in altitudinal sequence. In this analysis, we considered biomes from throughout North America and used supplemental information to alleviate adverse effects of the misaligned data files.  We built on the statistical modeling of Rehfeldt et al. (2006) to predict contemporary realized climatic niches of North American biomes. Ecological niche models have received considerable criticism mostly because of their inability to represent migration or colonization potentials, competitive interactions, and effects of enhanced CO2 on water-use efficiency. The first of these is not an issue. Niche modelers themselves make no claims of projecting species distributions, but instead emphasize that their models project suitable climates. Likewise, competitive interactions that limit species distributions can be defined climatically and are invalidated only when future climates have no contemporary analog. By predicting and projecting the occurrence of novel climates, statistical models can negate this second point of contention. However, it is true that correlative models are not yet capable of accounting for physiological impacts of enhanced CO2 on gas exchange and productivity. Such effects, however, are well characterized in only a few species, and impacts on species distributions are unknown. More research is required before effects of enhanced CO2 can be incorporated with credibility into vegetation models, whether correlative or mechanistic. Land managers require decision-support tools suitable for dealing with oncoming climate-mediated ecosystem changes. Progress has been made in converting climatically static vegetation simulators to climatically dynamic models, and guidelines are in use for managing future generations of the broadly dispersed Larix occidentalis of western North America and the narrow endemics, Picea chihuahuensis, P. mexicana, and P. martinezii of Mexico. Yet, for much of North America, comprehensive management guidelines do not exist.

empirical bioclimatic models. Many recent changes in tree mortality, tree species distributions, and tree growth rates have been linked to changes in climate. Given that future climatic changes will likely surpass those experienced in the recent past, trees will likely face additional challenges as temperatures continue to rise and precipitation regimes shift. Managing forests in the face of climate change will require a basic understanding of which tree species will be most vulnerable to climate change and in what ways they will be vulnerable. We assessed the relative vulnerability to climate change of 11 tree species in western North America using a multivariate approach to quantify elements of sensitivity to climate change, exposure to climate change, and the capacity to adapt to climate change. Our assessment was based on a combination of expert knowledge, published studies, and projected changes in climate. The 11 species exhibited a range of vulnerabilities. Garry oak (Quercus garryana) was determined to be the most vulnerable, largely due to its relatively high sensitivity. Garry oak occupies some of the driest low woodland and savanna sites from British Columbia to California and is highly dependent on disturbances, such as periodic, low intensity fire. These low intensity and high frequency fires suppress competition and intrusion of Garry oak woodlands by conifers. Garry oak is also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and generally only dominates dry sites. Big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) was determined to be the least vulnerable of the 11 species, largely due to its adaptive capacity. Big leaf maple can reproduce quickly after disturbances and its seeds can disperse long distances potentially allowing it to move in response to a changing climate. Our analyses provide a framework for assessing vulnerability and for determining why some species will likely be more vulnerable than others. Such information will be critical as natural resource managers and conservation practitioners strive to address the impacts of climate change with limited funds. In support of the Pacific Northwest Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (www.climatevulnerability.org) we developed a series of tree species projections for use in regional planning. Tree distributions models were built using 42 climate and bioclimatic variables from Climate Western North America climate dataset (www.climatevulnerability.org).

This GIS dataset is one of several climate connectivity analyses produced by Tristan Nu\u00f1ez for a Master's thesis (Nu\u00f1ez 2011). The dataset was produced in part to assist the Climate Change Subgroup of the Washington Wildlife Habitat Connectivity Working Group (WHCWG). The core areas in the map lie in Washington State and neighboring areas in British Columbia, Idaho, and Oregon.This connectivity analysis should be displayed in conjunction with vector layer of Landscape Integrity Core Areas developed by the WHCWG (WHCWG 2010).  This GIS dataset is part of a suite of wildlife habitat connectivity data produced by the Washington Wildlife Habitat Connectivity Working Group (WHCWG). The WHCWG is a voluntary public-private partnership between state and federal agencies, universities, tribes, and non-governmental organizations. The WHCWG is co-led by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and the Washington Department of Transportation (WSDOT).  This dataset quantifies current wildlife habitat connectivity patterns for the Columbia Plateau Ecoregion in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.  Available WHCWG raster data include model base layers, resistance, habitat, cost-weighted distance, and landscape integrity.  Grid cell size is 90 m x 90 m. Habitat concentration areas, core areas, and linkage maps reside in raster and vector format.

Report document available online at: http://www.waconnected.org.  The purpose of layers created using the climate gradient linkage-modeling method (Nu\u00f1ez 2011) is to help inform conservation practitioners, land use planners, and interested stakeholders in their understanding of areas likely to be important for biota as species adapt their distributions to climatic change. As noted in Nu\u00f1ez (2011), the results using this method are exploratory and intended to be broad-scale and generic in nature, and are not intended to direct conservation resources to specific locations or organisms. The purpose of this specific layer, which is based on both temperature gradients and human land use patterns (landscape integrity), is to illustrate routes on the landscape between landscape integrity core areas that provide for unidirectional change in mean annual temperature between the core areas while avoiding areas of low landscape integrity (e.g., agricultural, urban, or transportation land

to the linkage width cutoff listed in Table 2.2 WHCWG (2012). As with the statewide analysis (see WHCWG 2010), the normalized least-cost corridor algorithms produced wall-to-wall linkage maps, with everygrid cell in the study area having a value that represented its deviation from the nearest least-cost movement route. This necessitated creating maps that displayed only values from zero (the optimum modeled route) to a species-specific linkage width cutoff to identify areas that contribute most to connectivity between each HCA pair. Because of the smaller extent of this analysis and the finer-scale data that were available, we chose cutoff values (Table 2.2, WHCWG 2012) that produced linkage zone widths that were somewhat narrower than those mapped at the statewide scale, while being mindful of the intent that linkage zones serve not only focal species, but other species and processes as well. Keeping linkage zones reasonably wide also acknowledges that there is still considerable uncertainty in GIS base data, resistance models, and other parameters used in our modeling process. We did not wish users of our products to assume that very narrow corridors necessarily indicate the areas most important for wildlife movement.

In this species, the supercooling point (SCP) is representative of mortality induced by acute cold exposure. Mountain pine beetle SCP and associated cold-induced mortality fluctuate throughout a generation, with the highest SCPs prior to and following winter. Using observed SCPs of field-collected D. ponderosae larvae throughout the developmental season and associated phloem temperatures, we developed a mechanistic model that describes the SCP distribution of a population as a function of daily changes in the temperature-dependent processes leading to gain and loss of cold tolerance. It is based on the changing proportion of individuals in three states: (1) a non cold-hardened, feeding state, (2) an intermediate state in which insects have ceased feeding, voided their gut content and eliminated as many ice-nucleating agents as possible from the body, and (3) a fully cold-hardened state where insects have accumulated a maximum concentration of cryoprotectants (e.g. glycerol). Shifts in the proportion of individuals in each state occur in response to the driving variables influencing the opposite rates of gain and loss of cold hardening. The level of cold-induced mortality predicted by the model and its relation to extreme winter temperature is in good agreement with a range of field and laboratory observations. Our model predicts that cold tolerance of D. ponderosae varies within a season, among seasons, and among geographic locations depending on local climate. This variability is an emergent property of the model, and has important implications for understanding the insect's response to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, as well as population response to climate change. Because cold-induced mortality is but one of several major influences of climate on D. ponderosae population dynamics, we suggest that this model be integrated with others simulating the insect's biology.

The effects of climate change may be particularly large in mountainous regions where climate can vary significantly with elevation. Understanding potential future vegetation changes in these regions requires methods that can resolve vegetation responses to climate change at fine spatial resolutions. This research was projected using three models: cgcm31, hadley, and current. We used LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, to assess potential future vegetation changes for a large topographically complex area of the northwest United States and southwest Canada (38.0\u201358.0\u00b0N latitude by 136.6\u2013103.0\u00b0W longitude). LPJ is a process-based vegetation model that mechanistically simulates the effect of changing climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetation. It was developed and has been mostly applied at spatial resolutions of 10-minutes or coarser. In this study, we used LPJ at a 30-second (~1-km) spatial resolution to simulate potential vegetation changes for 2070\u20132099. LPJ was run using downscaled future climate simulations from five coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (CCSM3, CGCM3.1(T47), GISS-ER, MIROC3.2(medres), UKMO-HadCM3) produced using the A2 greenhouse gases emissions scenario. Under projected future climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the simulated vegetation changes result in the contraction of alpine, shrub-steppe, and xeric shrub vegetation across the study area and the expansion of woodland and forest vegetation. Large areas of maritime cool forest and cold forest are simulated to persist under projected future conditions. The fine spatial-scale vegetation simulations resolve patterns of vegetation change that are not visible at coarser resolutions and these fine-scale patterns are particularly important for understanding potential future vegetation changes in topographically complex areas. The aim of this study was to simulate vegetation responses to climate change at a fine spatial resolution across our topographically complex study area that includes vegetation ranging from xeric vegetation in the interior western United States to mesic vegetation along the Pacific Coast. LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, was able to accurately simulate historical vegetation for many parts of the study area when compared with both potential natural vegetation data for the United States and remotely sensed land cover data, providing confidence in the model's ability to simulate vegetation at fine spatial resolutions in topographically complex regions. The simulated future vegetation changes displayed fine spatial-scale patterns of contraction, expansion, and persistence of vegetation, all mediated by the region\u2019s topography.

Bioclimatic models were built using the Random Forest algorithm. Projected changes in vegetation were also modeled using the Random Forest algorithm but were produced by Rehfeldt et al. (2012). Projected current distribution is based on the average climate conditions for the years 1961-1990. Projected future distributions are based on average climate conditions for the years 2070-2099 using downscaled (30-second or ~1-kilometer resolution) climate projections from two Global Circulation Models: CGCM3.1 (T47) and UKMO-HadCM3. Both projections use the A2 emissions scenario and are from the CMIP3 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report) family of climate simulations. Due to changing climatic conditions, species ranges are expected to shift throughout the course of this century. Modeling subsequent shifts in suitable habitat for animal species, and the resulting changes in species assemblages, represent critical information for resource planners and managers. Developing robust suitability models for large geographic areas can be challenging, in part due to insufficient sampling data and to computational limits associated with modeling large geographies at a fine-grained spatial resolution. To overcome these challenges, I developed a method to model habitat suitability in which I built correlative climate suitability models for 366 terrestrial animal species at a relatively coarse spatial resolution for the entire North American continent using species range maps and 23 bioclimatic variables. I then applied the models to both current and projected future climate data downscaled to a moderately fine resolution for western North America. I refined the resulting climate suitability projections by applying a filter that limited suitability to areas in which suitable biomes were projected to be present. I verified my modeling results using an independent species occurrence data set, finding a median accuracy rate of 70%. I found that incorporating information about biomes into the models resulted in projections of larger climate-driven changes in suitability\u2014on average a difference of about 10%. My results also indicate that study species are more likely to see climate-driven losses than gains in habitat suitability. The percentage of study species projected to undergo a significant net decrease in habitat suitability was double the percentage projected to experience a net increase. These results highlight the shortcomings of many broad-scale models and highlight the need to take finer scale vegetation patterns into account. They also indicate that while many animal species could potentially benefit from climate-change induced increases in habitat suitability, the majority of species may suffer from substantial decreases, complicating future conservation efforts. Here, I combine species distribution models based on climate variables with simple biome-level habitat associations to produce models that can project future impacts on species distributions based on projected changes in climate and vegetation, with a reasonable level of accuracy. I then examine how refining the climate suitability models with these biomes associations affects the current suitability for each study species, and also compare differences in mean expansion and contraction of future species habitat suitability as simulated by two global circulation model projections and one emission scenario.", "avg_sim": 0.5838, "item_url":

Coastal regions are also home to species and habitats that provide critical services to humans, such as wetlands that buffer coasts from storms. Therefore, sea-level rise and the associated changes in coastlines challenge both human communities and ecosystems.  Understanding which coastal lands will be vulnerable to sea-level rise is critical for policy makers, land-use planners, and coastal residents. Focusing on the coastal region from Virginia to Maine, researchers examined a range of different possible sea-level rise scenarios, combined with information on features of the coastal landscape (such as elevation and land cover type), to forecast which coastal areas would likely flood, and which would likely change or move as a result of sea-level rise. Researchers found that 70 percent of the Northeast U.S. Atlantic Coast has the capacity to change over the next several decades in response to rising seas.  Knowing where coastal habitats are likely to be resilient, where they will likely change, and where they might flood as a result of sea-level rise is essential for developing management and resource allocation strategies that preserve coastal areas. By distinguishing the response of coastlines to different sea-level rise scenarios, the results of this project can inform coastal land management decision-making about how to best adapt human and natural communities to potential future changes to coastal areas.

Model results provide predictions of adjusted land elevation ranges (AE) with respect to forecast sea-levels, a likelihood estimate of this outcome (PAE), and a probability of coastal response (CR) characterized as either static or dynamic. The predictions span the coastal zone vertically from -12 meters (m) to 10 m above mean high water (MHW). Results are produced at a horizontal resolution of 30 meters for four decades (the 2020s, 2030s, 2050s and 2080s). Adjusted elevations and their respective probabilities are generated using regional geospatial datasets of current sea-level forecasts, vertical land movement rates, and current elevation data. Coastal response type predictions incorporate adjusted elevation predictions with land cover data and expert knowledge to determine the likelihood that an area will be able to accommodate or adapt to water level increases and maintain its initial land class state or transition to a new non-submerged state (dynamic) or become submerged (static). Intended users of these data include scientific researchers, coastal planners, and natural resource management communities.

The purpose of this project is to develop a spatially explicit, probabilistic model of coastal response for the Northeastern U.S. to a variety of sea-level scenarios that take into account the variable nature of the coast and provides outputs at spatial and temporal scales suitable for decision support. Model results provide predictions of adjusted land elevation ranges (AE) with respect to forecast sea-levels, a likelihood estimate of this outcome (PAE), and a probability of coastal response (CR) characterized as either static or dynamic. The predictions span the coastal zone vertically from -12 meters (m) to 10 m above mean high water (MHW). Results are produced at a horizontal resolution of 30 meters for four decades (the 2020s, 2030s, 2050s and 2080s). Adjusted elevations and their respective probabilities are generated using regional geospatial datasets of current sea-level forecasts, vertical land movement rates, and current elevation data. Coastal response type predictions incorporate adjusted elevation predictions with land cover data and expert knowledge to determine the likelihood that an area will be able to accommodate or adapt to water level increases and maintain its initial land class state or transition to a new non-submerged state (dynamic) or become submerged (static). Intended users of these data include scientific researchers, coastal planners, and natural resource management communities.

These data are based on the following inputs: sea-level rise, vertical land movement rates due to glacial isostatic adjustment, elevation data, and land cover data. The output displays a probability based on binary end members for the forecast year as defined by a probabilistic framework (a Bayesian network). Because the static vs dynamic coastal response is a binary relationship, the dynamic (i.e. landform or landscape change) coastal response can be derived by subtracting the static response from 1 (and vice versa).

throughout the country and world. Effective conservation of migratory birds depends on a clear understanding of how environmental factors affect key demographic rates (e.g., survival and reproduction). This informational need is especially pressing in the context of climate change. Climate change is expected to affect migratory bird habitat and populations in multiple ways, and a mechanistic understanding of how demographic rates are related to climate variables will help land and resource managers to better anticipate and manage these changes.  The Institute for Bird Populations (IBP) is addressing this question by using data from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program, the longest running continent-wide monitoring program to provide information on migratory bird demographics (recruitment, survival, immigration, and emigration). Data collected through MAPS is used to clarify the factors driving population declines; to determine priority areas to target for conservation and restoration; and to clarify relationships between demographic trends and environmental factors. IBP is also collaborating with researchers from the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center to develop a climate-informed integrated population model by combining MAPS data with additional data sources on climate variables, population trends, and occupancy data. This model will provide a clearer understanding of the factors that impact migratory bird populations and the ways that climate change is likely to affect species survival by clarifying relationships between climate variables and demographic parameters. Ultimately, this research will provide decision makers and the management community with a mechanistic understanding of how climate change may impact migratory bird population levels and ultimately species survival.

To address this need, researchers will identify historical rates and causes of vegetation change in shrubland ecosystems, then use this information to develop potential future climate and land use scenarios for three federally-managed lands in the region \u2013 Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge (USFWS), Beaty Butte Herd Management Area (BLM), and Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge (USFWS). Located near the Oregon-Nevada border, these units have a unique land use history and differing management practices. Through interagency partnerships, researchers will merge USGS land cover and fire data; USFWS and BLM data on grazing allotments, feral horse populations, and land treatments; and historical temperature and precipitation records to characterize the rates and causes of vegetation change. Once these relationships have been established, researchers will project future changes in vegetation within these three units through 2050. Maps will be produced that show where change may occur, where vegetation is more likely to degrade under continued stress, and where vegetation may recover more quickly.   BLM and USFWS managers can use this information to understand how critical vegetation types such as sagebrush might change over time, and what these changes will mean for species that depend on sagebrush for habitat. By presenting the impacts of climate and land use change on vegetation, land managers can customize adaptation plans to meet mission specific criteria including vegetation rehabilitation and habitat conservation. The results also hold the potential to identify best management practices and guide climate adaptation efforts across all sagebrush ecosystems in the West.", "proj_items": {}, "num_items": 0}, "580eb5cee4b0f497e794df52": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/580eb5cee4b0f497e794df52", "proj_phrases": ["recharge aquifers", "statewide data", "project researchers", "data", "invasive plants", "hawaiian forests", "soil hydrophobicity", "large impacts", "groundwater recharge", "hawai\u02bbi \u2019", "invasive animals", "future conditions", "water users", "impact water resources", "\u2019 s", "water resources", "key soil characteristics", "hawaiian islands", "invasive plant populations", "hawai\u02bbi", "increased", "moderate amounts", "primary", "feral pigs", "wet forests", "control runoff", "understory composition", "rainfall patterns", "exact route", "elevation upland areas", "water flow", "hydraulic conductivity", "soil properties", "soil characteristics", "precipitation", "intact native mesic", "primary soil characteristics", "limited water resources", "project"], "avg_item_sim": 0, "proj_summary": "Precipitation in Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s higher elevation upland areas provides needed water to both people and ecosystems. Once it reaches the ground, rain can either run off and contribute to water flow in streams, or it can infiltrate into the ground and provide water for plants and recharge aquifers and groundwater. The exact route that water takes is controlled by many factors, including the duration and intensity of rainfall, the topography of the land, soil properties, and vegetation.   The introduction and spread of invasive plants and animals in Hawaiian forests, which alters the water-use and soil characteristics of ecosystems, can have large impacts on downstream water users. Increased demand and competition for limited water resources in Hawai\u02bbi has underscored the need for a better understanding of this relationship; however, relevant statewide data is currently lacking.   The objective of this project is to understand how expanding invasive plant populations and changing rainfall patterns will impact water resources in the future. Project researchers are exploring the differences in key soil characteristics that control runoff and groundwater recharge in managed and relatively intact native mesic (moderate amounts of water) and wet forests and in similar invasive-dominated forests. Primary soil characteristics of interest are the hydraulic conductivity of soils (ability of water to move through soils) and soil hydrophobicity (a property that causes water to collect on the surface rather than infiltrating into the ground). Data will also be collected on the canopy and understory composition in the forests and on disturbances by invasive animals, like feral pigs. Results from the study will be presented in reports and maps of vegetation and soil characteristics across the Hawaiian Islands under current and future conditions.

This data was developed for use in a landscape simulation modeling study aimed at evaluating how well alternative management strategies maintain whitebark pine populations under historical climate and future climate conditions. For the study, we developed three spatial management alternatives for whitebark pine in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem representing no active management, current management, and climate-informed management. These management alternatives were implemented in the simulaton model FireBGCv2 under historical climate and three future climate change scenarios - the HadGEM-ES, CESM1-CAM5, and CNRM-CM5 Global Circulation Models under the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario. We worked with the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee's (GYCC) Whitebark Pine Subcommittee to develop this spatial representation of their current management strategy. The treatments mapped represent a set of the treatments recommended in the GYCC Whitebark Pine 2011 Strategy document and include planting blister-rust resistant whitebark pine seedlings, competition removal thinning, wildland fire use and prescribed fire, and protection from mountain pine beetles using verbenone and carbaryl. We used historical and future projections of climate suitability based on species distribution models for whitebark pine (Chang et al. 2014) to map zones of core, deteriorating, and future whitebark pine habitat. Core zones were those areas that are currently suitable for whitebark and remain suitable in the future. Deteriorating zones were where the climatic conditions for whitebark pine are expected to decline. Future zones were areas that are projected to become newly suitable for whitebark pine. We then overlaid our climate zones for whitebark pine with similar projections of future climate suitability for all of whitebark pine\u2019s competitors - Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, and Douglas-fir (Piekielek et al. 2015. We discussed the different combinations of climate suitability zones (core, deteriorating, future) and potential future level of competition (low or high) from other species with the GYCC Whitebark Pine Subcommittee to determine which management activities should be prioritized within each management zone. The result is a map of management zones where different activities are prioritized to meet the goal of maintaining whitebark pine populations. This was used to determine which treatments would be implemented spatially during the simulation modeling, dependent upon additional criteria related to simulated stand-level conditions. In this dataset, we used the resulting map of spatially prioritized management activities to summarize the area prioritized for each management activity that fell within Core, Deteriorating, and Future climate suitability zones The purpose of this data is to provide a tabular summary of the area prioritized for treatment within each future climate suitability zone for whitebark pine and for each management scenario.

Recent changes in climate have caused winter flooding and warmer summer water temperatures in the region, reducing the cold-water habitats that bull trout depend on. The southernmost bull trout populations, found in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada, are currently restricted to small reserves where the coldest waters still exist. These shrinking habitats have created a severed environment being further split by dams, poor water quality, and invasive species.  The goal of this project was to determine how these factors threaten the species regionally by using predictions of stream temperature to map habitat areas that support juvenile bull trout. Results show that maintaining larger areas of cold water habitat had the greatest, positive impact on bull trout habitat conservation. Other conditions that support bull trout include very cold summer water temperatures, fewer winter floods, and fewer human disturbances (such as the building of dams). Based on these results, specific climate adaptation actions that local managers might consider include prioritizing land and water use to foster colder summer water temperatures, controlling invasive species, increasing connectivity between Bull Trout habitats, and continuing monitoring efforts.  To ensure that these results and habitat maps could be incorporated into management actions, researchers met with stakeholders including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the U.S. Forest Service, and the Burns Paiute Tribe.  As a result, the maps were used in forest planning for the Lolo National Forest in Montana, the Wenatchee River basin, and in the lower Pend Oreille River during the relicensing process for local dam operations. In addition, the recovery plan proposed by the USFWS incorporated these models into detailed analyses of bull trout habitat loss, which managers can use to prioritize actions in their Recovery Unit Implementation Plans.

We used predictions of temperatures in streams across approximately two-thirds of the species' range in the U.S. to map coldwater streams or \u201cpatches\u201d suitable for spawning and early rearing of Bull Trout. Each patch consists of streams with contiguous reaches of cold water. Patches were delineated using medium resolution National Hydrography Dataset streams containing modeled temperatures available at 1 km intervals, as provided by the NorWeST project (http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST.html).Once the patches were delineated, various watershed metrics were generated for each patch to provide covariates for occupancy models that were used to estimate the probability of presence of Bull Trout. Watershed metrics included climatic and/or local factors hypothesized to influence Bull Trout, such as patch size, connectivity to other patches, migratory habitat size, brook trout presence, lake trout presence, human influence, road density, prevalence of very cold water, winter high flow events, and wildfire. Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) is one of the most cold-adapted species in freshwater in North America. The species is listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act throughout its range within the conterminous United States, which encompasses a vast geography, including major river systems such as the Klamath and Columbia Rivers, and a host of Pacific coastal rivers in Washington State, as well as river systems originating east of the continental divide in northern Montana and ultimately draining to the Atlantic Ocean.Our fundamental objective in this project is to evaluate climate-related and local threats to Bull Trout and to provide an objective and unified framework for evaluating them together across the species\u2019 range within the conterminous United States. To this end, we have 1) developed and applied methods for delineating and mapping discrete patches of habitat that support spawning and early rearing of Bull Trout, 2) attributed these patches with covariates indicating climate-related and local threats to Bull Trout, and 3) developed models to relate these covariates to presence of Bull Trout to identify the most important factors influencing presence, and to quantify spatial variation in their influences.

Climate change, in particular, challenges many of the basic assumptions used by conservation planners and managers. Previous conservation planning efforts identified and prioritized areas for conservation based on the current environmental conditions, such as habitat quality, and assumed that conditions in conservation lands would be largely controlled by management actions (including no action). Climate change, however, will likely alter important system drivers (temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise) and make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain recent historic conditions in conservation lands into the future. Climate change will also influence the future conservation potential of non-conservation lands, further complicating conservation planning.

The plant was once considered a conservation success, when active management led to a population recovery in the early 20th century. Unfortunately, silversword populations are now declining, and climate change \u2013 namely decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures \u2013 is thought to be responsible.   The goal of this project is to collect data on both silverswords and climate conditions to pinpoint the exact cause of silversword declines and to predict how the species will fare under potential future climate scenarios. Researchers will then identify management strategies that might help restore silversword populations. So far, results show that silversword populations have declined by about 60% since 1990, and that this decline coincides with lower rainfall.   The prominence of the silversword within the Hawaiian alpine ecosystem renders it one of the more visible examples of climate change-induced biodiversity loss. Identifying the specific climatic variables that are contributing to the silversword population decline will help Park managers determine which management actions will be necessary to protect this iconic species into the future.

However, data on river fisheries is not collected in any standardized format globally. Although targeted analyses have been conducted on certain river systems, the approaches used, such as intensive field sampling, are not feasible at a global scale. Most river fish are harvested by small-scale operations and in countries that lack the necessary infrastructure and technology that would enable regular reporting of harvests.  Therefore, alternative approaches are needed for estimating the harvest potential of river fisheries at a global scale. Given changing climate conditions and the potential impact of these changes on river fisheries, developing a baseline understanding of estimated harvest potential will be key for monitoring change. For example, rivers in tropical and mid-latitude regions are expected to experience reductions in annual flow, while those in high-latitude regions are expected to have increased annual runoff. These changes will have implications for water supply, irrigation, hydropower demand, and ultimately, fisheries.  The goals of this project are to (1) compile a standardized database of global river fishery information, collected through a systematic literature review; (2) combine this database with remote sensing and other environmental data to develop a model of river harvest potential; and (3) identify ways in which river harvest might be expected to change as a result of changes in climate and land use.

Warming temperatures, clearly documented in climate records for the Colorado River basin, are having an impact on the amount of annual streamflow yielded from rain and snow. Recent work has revealed that warming temperatures have played an increasingly important role over the past decades, both exacerbating droughts and dampening the effects of wet winters on high stream flows. Understanding and anticipating how warming temperatures will influence future water supply in the Colorado River basin is increasingly important for resource management, particularly in light of recent drought conditions.   The overarching goals of this project are to better understand the influence of temperature on Colorado River streamflow, particularly during droughts, and assist water managers in planning for future droughts. This work expands on a recently completed study, building on that project in two main ways. First, this project extends collaborative work between scientists and Colorado River basin water managers to investigate the range of potential drought conditions under early 21st century warming, using both recent and historical data. For example, with precipitation reconstructions from tree rings for the past 500 years, the team can use a simple hydrologic model to assess the impacts of the longest and most severe droughts of the past on the Colorado River under today\u2019s warmer temperatures. With this information, the project team will contribute to a set of plausible scenarios of future drought that planners can use to help make resource-management decisions. Second, the project is more explicitly examining the drivers of Colorado River drought, with a focus on factors such as the phase of precipitation (rain vs. snow), the timing and rate of snowmelt, and evaporation rates. The project team will also begin to explore the ways that changing temperatures and streamflow might impact the ecological health of the upper Colorado River basin.", "proj_items": {}, "num_items": 0}, "521cf64fe4b01458f7858019": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/521cf64fe4b01458f7858019", "proj_phrases": ["consumptive use", "aquatic ecosystems", "understanding", "management decisions", "hydrologic effects", "data products", "historical", "climate projections", "consumptive water use", "future conditions", "water users", "water resources system", "water resources", "available water supply", "historical changes", "anthropogenic influences", "available water", "sciencebase", "available climate data", "change streamflow", "water cycle", "important component", "future climatic conditions"], "avg_item_sim": 0, "proj_summary": "Understanding the changes in the distribution and quantity of, and demand for, water resources in response to a changing climate is essential to planning for, and adapting to, future climatic conditions.

Historical changes in available water may be attributed to changes in precipitation; but these changes may also be attributable to changes in consumptive use.

The objective of this project was to provide an automated methodology and data products that the public can view, work with, and download through ScienceBase to assess: the accuracy of available climate data and climate projections, the hydrologic effects of these drivers on runoff for historical and future conditions, and the role of consumptive water use on available water supply.

However, to date, limited data and the uncertain effects of climate change have hindered predictions of future streamflow.  Through this project, scientists developed a model that provides a way to estimate future stream low flow (streamflow during a period of prolonged dryness) by categorizing streams based on their physical characteristics. While the model is based on data from gaged streams (i.e., those fitted with measuring devices to monitor streamflow), it allows researchers to also predict streamflow at ungaged (unmonitored) sites and thus develop island- or state-wide predictions of stream response to future rainfall conditions.  Researchers used the model to forecast flow changes in Maui streams under two possible end-of-century future climate scenarios. Results indicate that in areas where rainfall is projected to decrease in the future, stream low flow may decrease by more than 50 percent in some areas, and habitat for native species may decrease by more than 25 percent in some streams.

The Gulf of Maine population began to decline significantly by the late 19th century, leading to the closure of the commercial Atlantic salmon fishery in 1948. In recent years, populations have again begun to decrease again. State and federal fisheries biologists are concerned that climate-related changes in streamflow and temperature could impact salmon survival in these rivers. Projections of future climate conditions for the Northeast indicate warming air temperatures, earlier snowmelt runoff, and decreases in streamflow during the low flow period (summer). In the spring, snow melts in the Northeast and recharges groundwater supplies. As climate conditions change, snow is melting earlier, resulting in longer periods of low streamflow in summer. These changes are of concern because this period is critical in the Atlantic salmon life cycle.   The goal of this project was to investigate changes in summer low streamflow and stream temperatures to identify how endangered Atlantic salmon populations might be affected by these changes. Researchers assessed past changes in groundwater discharge to rivers in the Gulf of Maine using historical flow data and estimated future streamflow, temperature, and groundwater discharge during summer low-flow periods using climate-model data and detailed watershed models.   A main result of this work was the development of a watershed model for four rivers in Maine that provide important habitat for Atlantic salmon: The Pleasant, Narraguagus, Sheepscot, and Royal Rivers. Researchers developed models of these river basins that provide daily streamflow, which enables managers to characterize the timing and quantity of water moving through each basin. This information can then be used to test how different streamflow and water temperature conditions might impact salmon.

Throughout the course of 2017, the gauge registered an unprecedented number of high-water events. These record high sea levels were the result of a series of compounding factors: ongoing sea-level rise, seasonally-elevated high tides, and a region of warm water combining with ocean eddies.   The threat of rising sea levels to the essential infrastructure and cultural assets of island communities is well known. However, inadequate information limits the ability of resource managers to predict and prepare for the impacts of sea-level rise and associated inundation. Researchers will address this issue by collaborating with the National Park Service to identify the specific needs of managers at two national parks in Hawai\u2019i: the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument (VALR), which is home to the USS Arizona Memorial, and Pu\u2018uhonua O H\u014dnaunau National Historical Park (PUHO). These parks were impacted by the high water levels observed in 2017. Boat docks at VALR were compromised, and culturally sensitive archeological features were inundated at PUHO. As a result, park managers are trying to understand the implications of these events for the future of park assets and operations.   Building upon previous research efforts to better understand the frequency and implications of future coastal flooding and inundation events in the Pacific Islands, researchers will develop tools that provide the current status and advanced notice of the various oceanic conditions that contribute to high water levels. Researchers will work with park managers to determine relevant water level thresholds and planning horizons for VALR and PUHO, and identify at-risk assets and assess their vulnerability. The informational tools that will be developed will directly benefit these parks and will also serve as a basis for the development of similar products to aid managers of other coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea-level rise.", "proj_items": {}, "num_items": 0}, "5315fd83e4b0c003137674a5": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5315fd83e4b0c003137674a5", "proj_phrases": ["climate registry", "community resource", "science center", "september 2016", "vulnerability", "valuable information", "usgcrp adaptation science work group", "afwa", "september", "public search", "usgcrp adaptation", "such assessments", "users", "vulnerability assessments", "wildlife", "wildlife agencies", "association", "ilmag", "specific geographic regions", "usgs national climate change", "climate adaptation knowledge exchange", "human resources", "fish", "\u2019 s", "usgs", "climate change adaptation planning", "climate adaptation knowledge", "wildlife science center", "interagency land management adaptation group", "assessment", "ecoadapt", "climate", "member", "certain resources", "science work group", "climate change vulnerability assessments", "non-profit partner", "public registry", "interagency land management adaptation", "crave", "nccwsc", "houses information", "climate change", "adaptation planning", "several ngo \u2019", "assessment targets", "ngo"], "avg_item_sim": 0, "proj_summary": "The USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC), as part of the work of the Interagency Land Management Adaptation Group (ILMAG), initiated a project in 2013 to develop plans for a searchable, public registry on climate change vulnerability assessments.

To buffer against global change, an established adaptation strategy is designing protected areas to increase representation and complementarity of biodiversity features. Uncertainty regarding the scale and magnitude of landscape change complicates reserve planning and exposes decision makers to risk of failing to meet conservation goals. Conservation planning tends to treat risk as an absolute measure, ignoring the context of the management problem and risk preferences of stakeholders. Application to conservation of risk management theory emphasizes diversification of portfolio of assets, with the goal of reducing the impact of system volatility on investment return. We use principles of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which quantifies risk as the variance and correlation among assets, to formalize diversification as an explicit strategy for managing risk in climate\u2010driven reserve design. We extend MPT to specify a framework that evaluates multiple conservation objectives, allows decision makers to balance management benefits and risk when preferences are contested or unknown, and includes additional decision options such as parcel divestment when evaluating candidate reserve designs. We apply an efficient search algorithm that optimizes portfolio design for large conservation problems and a game theoretic approach to evaluate portfolio tradeoffs that satisfy decision makers with divergent benefit and risk tolerances, or when a single decision maker cannot resolve their own preferences. Evaluating several risk profiles for a case study in South Carolina, our results suggest that a reserve design may be somewhat robust to differences in risk attitude but that budgets will likely be important determinants of conservation planning strategies, particularly when divestment is considered a viable alternative. We identify a possible fiscal threshold where adequate resources allow protecting a sufficiently diverse portfolio of habitats such that the risk of failing to achieve conservation objectives is considerably lower. For a range of sea\u2010level rise projections, conversion of habitat to open water (14\u2010180%) and wetland loss (1\u20107%) are unable to be compensated under the current protected network.

a major threat to the sustainability and availability of water resources in the Southwestern U.S. Long-term decreases in precipitation can lead to reductions in regional groundwater levels and loss of groundwater storage in aquifers for some communities. Reduced precipitation can also lead to lower water levels in streams and losses in the vegetation that grows alongside riverbanks.   The goal of this project was to identify how hydrologic systems in the Southwest might respond to changes in climate and the degree to which this response is dependent on the characteristics of the hydrologic system. To do this, researchers developed a tool that simulates how quickly water moves from the surface to underground aquifers.  The tool helps identify timeframes and regions where seepage of water into aquifers is likely constant, rather than fluctuating with rainfall patterns or climate. By locating these areas upfront, researchers can exclude them from their analysis and focus water supply forecasting efforts on areas where groundwater is more likely to be affected by changes in rainfall or human uses at the surface.   The model shows that areas with a shallower water table tend to have more variability in the rate at which groundwater supplies are replenished, with secondary effects related to the soil type and the period of variation. In these areas, changes in rainfall and water withdrawal for irrigation or urban use have a bigger impact on groundwater availability. Water resource managers can use this tool to more accurately forecast how much groundwater remains in different watersheds and to determine which systems will be most sensitive to changes in climate and water use. The need for better forecasting is only increasing, as aquifers are increasingly tapped and precipitation patterns are expected to become more variable.

Assembling and harmonizing this wealth of data would provide a valuable resource for modeling, analyzing, and predicting water temperature.   This project will build upon previous work funded by the Northeast CASC that provided a foundation for modeling and predicting water temperature of approximately 11,000 lakes in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

With this information, the team will also analyze the habitat suitability of these lakes to several fish species.

LERI assesses anomalies in actual evapotranspiration (ETa), as percentiles, across the Contiguous US and northern Mexico at a 1-km spatial resolution. LERI is based on the ETa data produced by the U. S. Geological Survey using the operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model. SSEBop combines evapotranspiration fraction generated from remotely sensed MODIS thermal imagery, acquired every 8 days, with climatological atmospheric evaporative demand. To quantify LERI, a rank-based, non-parametric method is used to estimate percentiles of the SSEBop ETa, over a period of ETa accumulation, compared to the available period of record (January 2000 to present). LERI percentiles are also binned into four drought categories (LD0 - LD3) analogous to the US Drought Monitor (USDM) categories (i.e. D0-D3) and using the same percentile breaks that USDM considers for soil moisture. By its numerical design, LERI essentially represents the evaporative response of the landscape driven primarily by the anomalous state of soil moisture to meet the climatological atmospheric demand through a combination of evaporation (from soil and leaf surfaces) and transpiration (root-stomata-air) processes. Real-time and high-resolution assessment of this soil moisture state is extremely salient to understanding and forecasting ecological responses. LERI serves as an experimental drought-monitoring and early warning guidance tool and has the potential to inform research into understanding characteristics of Ecological Drought.

The ability of species to adapt to the impacts of climate change (i.e., their adaptive capacity) is an important factor to consider when assessing vulnerability. For example, organisms can possess traits that allow them to move to areas of favorable habitat or change their phenotypes (observable characteristics) in response to changing environmental conditions. Additionally, an organism\u2019s traits can adapt to a changing external environment over multiple generations through evolutionary processes.  Recent scientific evidence suggests that \u201cevolutionary adaptive capacity\u201d (the ability to adapt to changing environments via evolutionary processes; EVAC) can actually occur over shorter time periods than originally thought and the tools to measure and predict evolutionary changes are becoming increasingly available. However, accounting for EVAC in climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning is uncommon and resource managers often make decisions without considering the potential evolution of species.  The purpose of this project is to help bridge the gap between science and management communities by highlighting examples of EVAC that have resulted from changing climate conditions and providing insights on how relevant scientific information can be used in policy and planning activities. This work will foster a two-way communication between scientists and managers that focuses equally on what scientists can learn from managers and what managers can learn from scientists, increasing the likelihood of knowledge and science use by the decision-making community. The specific objectives are to 1) illustrate the importance of EVAC and its interaction with other forms of adaptive capacity for understanding vulnerability of wildlife, 2) identify common barriers that managers encounter with regards to assessing and making decisions related to EVAC, 3) provide knowledge that could serve as a solution for overcoming these barriers, and 4) identify knowledge gaps where future research is needed to inform key management questions.

In western Montana for example, snowshoe hare make up 96% of lynx diet. In fact, hares are critical players in forest ecosystems because most carnivores prey on them.   The main way that snowshoe hares escape predation is through camouflage. In response to changes in day length, snowshoe hares molt seasonally, changing color from brown to white in the winter to blend in with the snowfall and hide from predators. However, due to shorter snow seasons caused by recent changes in climate, snowshoe hares are turning white before it snows, making them more visible to predators. Because 21 other species around the world also undergo these seasonal coat color changes, snowshoe hares also represent a window to understand climate change effects on wild animals.   The goal of this project was to investigate the causes and consequences of climate change induced color mismatch in snowshoe hares, focusing on populations in the Seeley-Swan valley and Gallatin National Forest in Montana. With the cooperation of multiple partners, including the University of Montana, the National Science Foundation, NASA, the National Park Service, Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and the U.S. Forest Service, this research combined field data with climate projections to directly evaluate how well wild animals might be able to adapt and persist in the face of climate change.    Results of this project show that snowshoe hares do not have much ability to adapt through behaviors such as hiding or fleeing more readily when they are white and mismatched against a brown snowless background. Also, they cannot readily adjust their color molt to track shorter snow seasons. Mismatched white animals on snowless ground were found to have a 7% higher chance of being killed each week by predators than color matched animals.   These results mean that without evolutionary changes, wild hares are highly likely to experience severe population declines by the end of the century. However, such declines are not inevitable, as the researchers note tangible ways that land managers could increase wildlife resilience to climate change by fostering \u2018evolutionary rescue\u2019 to climate change. In short, this project both provides specific information on snowshoe hares to wildlife managers, and also provides a novel way to foster resilience to climate change through evolutionary change.

The impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and severe storms, threaten the state\u2019s unique biodiversity\u2014yet managers are unsure how species will respond to these changes, which makes planning for the future difficult.   In order to identify the impacts of climate change on Florida\u2019s plants and wildlife, researchers developed regional climate scenarios identifying how temperature and precipitation patterns may change in the future. Researchers used climate model downscaling methods, which take climate data produced at a global scale to assess future climate at a local scale, to make climate predictions about Florida\u2019s climate. The results of the climate modeling effort identified changes in precipitation, temperature, seasonal cycles, and the frequency of events such as extreme heat days, frost days, and wildfire threats.   These scenarios were then used in species, habitat, and ecosystem models to characterize the potential ecological impacts of climate change. Focusing on the Greater Everglades and the Suwannee River-Big Bend, two areas that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, researchers modeled how plant and animal communities will respond to the predicted climate conditions.   The ecological impacts of climate change in Florida will have far-reaching implications, including economic \u2013 Everglades National Park, for example, receives close to one million visitors each year. Florida is also home to numerous sensitive ecosystems such as wetlands and sea grass, and a multitude of threatened and endangered species, such as the Florida panther and the iconic manatee. This study addresses critical questions about how these species and ecosystems will respond to climate change. The results of this research help indicate what the future looks like for the state, providing valuable information to resource managers seeking to protect Florida\u2019s unique plants, animals, and ecosystems.

Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action. We also encountered high levels of uncertainty in how climate change is expected to alter vegetation and how wildlife are expected to respond to these changes. This uncertainty limits the value of our assessment for informing proactive management of climate change impacts on both species-specific and biome-level connectivity (although biome-level assessments were subject to fewer sources of uncertainty). We offer suggestions for improving the management relevance of future studies based on our own insights and those of managers and biologists who participated in this assessment and provided critical review of this report.

exactly when, where, and how climate change effects will unfold. While models can be used to predict the types of impacts that climate change might have on a landscape, uncertainty remains surrounding factors such as how quickly changes will occur and how specific resources will respond.   In order to plan for this uncertain future, managers have begun to use a tool known as scenario planning. In this approach, a subset of global climate model projections are selected that represent a range of plausible future climate scenarios for a particular area. Through a series of facilitated workshops, managers can then explore different management options under each scenario, enabling them to be proactive in the face of uncertainty. However, selecting and synthesizing climate information for scenario planning requires significant time and skills, and it can be difficult to predict exactly how resources might respond to a combination of climate, management actions, and other factors.   Therefore, the goals of this project are to develop a process for creating regional climate summaries that can also be used for local scenario planning, and to pilot an approach for enhancing scenario planning through simulation modeling. Researchers will draw on global climate model projections to develop several climate summaries for the northern Great Plains region. The summaries will then be used for local-scale climate adaptation planning efforts for Badlands National Park (South Dakota) and Knife River Indian Villages National Historical Site (North Dakota) and surrounding federal and tribal lands. A final step will be to develop a simulation model for the South Dakota site to help managers address the \u201cwhat if\u201d questions regarding how management actions might affect focal resources under the different scenarios.   Not only will this project improve climate adaptation efforts in the northern Great Plains region, but it will also result in a new, integrative approach for identifying how climate change might affect key resources of management concern at a local-scale and what actions can be taken to protect these resources \u2013 a method that could be applied to management units across the country.", "proj_items": {"58e7ae48e4b09da6799c0e55": {"item_summary": "This is a spatially-explicit state-and-transition simulation model of rangeland vegetation dynamics in southwest South Dakota.

We produced downscaled climate data from historical (1901-2000) data sets and from future (2001-2100) climate simulations, generated by both coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and regional climate models (e.g., RegCM3). Data were downscaled at a relatively coarse resolution (e.g., ~10-km) for North America, and at a finer resolution (e.g., ~1-km) for the contiguous US and Alaska. Based on discussions with land managers, we used the climate data as input to existing environmental models to derive additional variables, such as bioclimate variables (e.g., moisture indices), that are required for management of specific resources (e.g., vegetation and habitat). These data were incorporated into an online web interface that allows managers to download the underlying climate data and to produce maps of future climate analogues.

Understanding these changes is then critical for understanding and predicting a variety of climate impacts to wildlife and ecosystems. However, little research has been conducted to date to understand how this change may impact high-latitude ecosystems, and, unfortunately, traditional methods used by scientists to measure and characterize drought do not apply to snowfall-dominated areas.

This project will use existing datasets (e.g. ground observations, remote sensing, and computer models) to understand the arrival and departure of snowpack and the speed that the snow is melting, and to observe how changing landscapes and ecosystems, including the occurrence of fire, might be impacting snow accumulation and melt.

Furthermore, CBM tends to focus on Indigenous peoples\u2019 role as \u2018knowledge holders.\u2019 This paper explores CBM through a governance lens by understanding CBM as a strategy for the assertion of Indigenous sovereignty and jurisdiction. Research findings revealed that CBM is understood as both a method for generating data useful for decision-making and an expression of governance itself, rooted in understandings of stewardship, kinship and responsibility. Our findings also suggest that data quality and credibility, trust and legitimacy and relevance to decision contexts are key to mobilizing CBM data in relevant decision-making processes. We provide three recommendations to improve linkages between CBM programs and Indigenous governance: Indigenous governments must take a leading role in CBM programs; networked capacity between Indigenous governments can be built using a bridging organization; and CBM programs should be closely coupled with Indigenous environmental governance strategies.

Forage conditions in arid and semi-arid regions are driven by unpredictable spatial and temporal patterns in rainfall. Diet selection by herbivores should be directed towards overcoming the most pressing nutritional limitation (i.e. energy, protein [nitrogen, N], moisture) within the constraints imposed by temporal and spatial variability in forage conditions. We investigated the influence of precipitation-induced shifts in forage nutritional quality and subsequent large herbivore responses across widely varying precipitation conditions in an arid environment. Specifically, we assessed seasonal changes in diet breadth and forage selection of adult female desert bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis mexicana in relation to potential nutritional limitations in forage N, moisture and energy content (as proxied by dry matter digestibility, DMD). Succulents were consistently high in moisture but low in N and grasses were low in N and moisture until the wet period. Nitrogen and moisture content of shrubs and forbs varied among seasons and climatic periods, whereas trees had consistently high N and moderate moisture levels. Shrubs, trees and succulents composed most of the seasonal sheep diets but had little variation in DMD. Across all seasons during drought and during summer with average precipitation, forages selected by sheep were higher in N and moisture than that of available forage. Differences in DMD between sheep diets and available forage were minor. Diet breadth was lowest during drought and increased with precipitation, reflecting a reliance on few key forage species during drought. Overall, forage selection was more strongly associated with N and moisture content than energy content. Our study demonstrates that unlike north-temperate ungulates which are generally reported to be energy-limited, N and moisture may be more nutritionally limiting for desert ungulates than digestible energy.

Warming temperatures in spring can reduce snow-fed flows, with serious implications for the water supplies that support communities and wildlife. While it is already well-known that precipitation has a significant influence on river flow, recent observations suggest that temperature and the amount of water in soil may also influence streamflow. In the face of a changing climate, it is important that resource managers understand how factors such as changing temperatures and precipitation will affect this vital water source.  To address this need, researchers are examining records of streamflow, temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation in the upper Colorado River basin going back more than 100 years, to see how these variables have changed during periods of low flow and drought. Next, researchers will analyze tree rings to reconstruct climatic conditions over the past 1,000 years to see if more recent droughts differ from historical climate patterns. This information will help researchers determine if droughts are lasting longer or are more severe than historical droughts, improving our understanding of the impacts of climate change in the region.   So far, researchers have found that warming temperatures have played an increasingly important role over the past decades, both exacerbating droughts and dampening the effects of wet winters on high flows.

Unfortunately, not only are these valuable ecosystems understudied compared to others, but they are also among the most sensitive to climate change. Climate change threatens wetlands by altering temperature and precipitation, which cause changes in water level and water temperature. Due to this threat, the international community and domestic agencies alike have highlighted the need to better understand wetlands in the face of climate change, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to the Ramsar Convention, to the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service.   Focusing on the Pacific Northwest region, this project substantially improves our understanding of wetlands and how they will respond to climate change. Researchers developed new methods to map and monitor wetlands, modeled historical and future wetland hydrologic conditions, and evaluated the impacts of climate change on wetlands and the species that rely on them.  Results show that montane wetlands \u2013 those found in high altitudes \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to climate change, which is causing reduced snowpack and longer summer drought, threatening the species that depend on them. Amphibians in particular, such as the Cascades frog, rely on wetlands for breeding and are at risk of local extinction due to the loss of suitable habitat.   This research produced information that is essential for managers seeking to understand the vulnerability of wetland ecosystems to climate change and to effectively plan for and mitigate its impacts. By studying wetlands in multiple locations throughout the Pacific Northwest, researchers discovered that the effects of climate change varied considerably between sites, suggesting that a one-size-fits all approach might not work \u2013 rather, management efforts may need to be tailored accordingly from site to site.

Understanding local adaptation, in turn, informs management decisions such as translocation to restore locally-extinct populations. We used a landscape genomics approach to detect genetic signatures of selection related to climatic variation among desert bighorn sheep populations across their indigenous range in the western United States. This approach allowed us to investigate broad patterns of both neutral and adaptive genetic variation across very different environments. Analyses suggested that ancestry and isolation by distance were the most significant forces driving genetic variation in desert bighorn sheep, but that climate was associated with at least 1 locus (i.e., location on the genome) under directional selection. The alternate allele (i.e., variant) at this locus was associated with biologically significant increases in elevation and precipitation, decreases in temperature, and was nearly private to herds occupying the Great Basin ecosystem. Our results suggest climate conditions at higher latitudes may have resulted in a distinct ecotype of desert bighorn sheep whose adaptations are still apparent among the few remaining indigenous populations in the Great Basin.

change has emerged as a key environmental concern of the 21st century and a major challenge for land and wildlife managers. Although scientists have made tremendous progress in predicting the impact of climate change on a regional and global scale, drilling down such projections to a locally applicable form has been difficult. A major project of the US Geological Survey's (USGS) Southwest Biological Science Center (SBSC), funded by the USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC), drew on the work of an interdisciplinary team of scientists to help close the gap between theory and practical application in the arid southwestern U.S. Climate change in this region is predicted to be extreme, with temperature increases within the next 60 to 90 years of 3.5 to 4 degrees Celsius and decreases in precipitation of 5 to 20 percent. These changes have the potential to profoundly affect plant and animal distributions and population viability. Furthermore, more than 70 percent of the lands in the southwestern U.S. are in public ownership. Managers of public lands and wildlife resources will have a particular need to understand climate-driven shifts in order to adapt management strategies to conserve and sustain habitats and wildlife. This project integrated results from three modules to produce data and tools that conservation managers can use in decision-making. These three modules enable scientists to assess the future prospects of the habitats and species most vulnerable to climate change in the Southwest. This information is vital to managers tasked with prioritizing conservation efforts and adapting strategies to sustain habitats and wildlife. The development of realistic landscape-scale models tailored to those species provides managers with practical, data-informed tools to use in decision-making.

These hazards have the potential to substantially disrupt the environment and commerce in the region, but more information is needed to determine the likely impacts.   To fill this gap, researchers sought to better understand how coastal processes will be affected by climate change.

Unfortunately, many agencies lack sufficient resources to compile, conduct quality assurance and control, and make accessible stream temperature data collected through routine monitoring. Yet, pooled data from many sources, even if temporally and spatially inconsistent, can have great value both in the realm of stream temperature and aquatic response. The NorEaST web portal was developed to serve as a coordinated, multi-agency regional framework to map and store continuous stream temperature locations and data for New England, Mid Atlantic, and Great Lakes states. NorEaST consists of a mapper where the public can view locations and metadata for current and historic stream temperature monitoring sites, a database where data stewards can store and manage their data, and web services to connect, communicate, and serve data for use in analysis and applications. Currently, stream temperature monitoring locations and metadata can be viewed for more than 10,000 monitoring locations across 30 states, contributed by 40 different organizations. Organizations collecting continuous stream temperature data can request to become NorEaST users and data stewards can use the web portal to store and manage their organization\u2019s continuous stream temperature data. To demonstrate the utility of large scale, consistent stream temperature data for use in regional analyses and decision-making, stream temperature data collected as part of the NorEaST project were used in three different targeted applications.

This project seeks to address this gap by developing new software tools that enable stakeholders to quickly develop custom, climate-sensitive land-use projections to satisfy a range of application needs. Stakeholders from across the region will participate in the development of the model through two workshops, designed to first gather stakeholder needs and then to apply and evaluate the model to ensure that it maximizes potential use across all stakeholder groups.  Users of the end-product will be able to build customized, scenario-based projections of landscape change, including landscape response to climate change, such as wildfires or altered vegetation patterns.

The goal of this project was to develop a framework to identify demographic sensitivities and assess the vulnerability of grassland bird species to future climate change. To do so, the researchers developed a strong partnership among managers and researchers to understand how climate change might impact the conservation and management planning of grassland birds throughout the Northeast CASC region and identify potentially vulnerable species. Using input from managers, the team focused their efforts on two grassland indicator species of high conservation interest: Henslow\u2019s Sparrows and Bobolinks. They developed spatially-explicit and temporally dynamic species distribution models for these indicator species and evaluated the effects of past and future climate on their populations. Finally, they studied how weather and extreme events (e.g., drought and flooding) effect the breeding success of grassland birds across North America.  By incorporating information on future climate change, the project team has identified regions where Henslow's Sparrows, a species of increasing conservation concern, are likely to face unsuitable conditions for reproduction. In addition, they have identified areas that will serve as likely refugia for this species in the future.

Managing these ecosystems into the future requires a better understanding of how climate, hydrology, and karst ecosystems interact.  The objective of this project was to determine how species and ecosystems associated with karst might respond to future temperature and precipitation extremes and accompanying changes in groundwater levels and springflow. The research focused on 16 species in the Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas and eight species in the Madison aquifer in western South Dakota. Researchers linked global climate models, regional climate models, and hydrologic models to determine how future springflow might be impacted by changes in temperature and precipitation. By combining information about future hydrology with what we know about species needs, researchers determined the vulnerability of the selected species to climate extremes.  Researchers found that more species in the Edwards aquifer are vulnerable to climate extremes than in the Madison aquifer, due in part to the more severe hydrologic changes that the Edwards aquifer is expected to undergo. This result suggests that including hydrologic factors critical to species health is essential in evaluating the vulnerability of karst ecosystems to climate extremes.

However, to date, available global climate models have been too coarse in resolution to be useful for planning in the context of small, isolated islands.  This project produced the first-ever set of high-resolution climate projections for Guam and American Samoa, providing information on key variables of interest to decision makers such as rainfall, air temperature, and tropical cyclone patterns. Modeling results suggest that both territories are expected to become warmer and experience a higher number of extreme rainfall events through the current century.

While pronghorns are numerous in parts of their range, such as Wyoming and northern Colorado, they are endangered in others, such as the Sonoran Desert. In the arid Southwest, pronghorn populations have been declining since the 1980s\u2014and it\u2019s thought that drought is partially to blame.   Average temperatures in the Southwest have increased 1.6\u00b0C since 1901, and the area affected by drought from 2001-2010 was the second largest observed since 1901. Drought conditions have reduced the availability of vegetation, impacting the survival of pronghorns and putting the long-term viability of the species in question, as climate change models predict warmer and drier conditions for the region in the future.   This project seeks to understand the impacts of drought on pronghorn populations in the Southwest. Specific objectives of the study are to (1) determine the extent of pronghorn population decline; (2) identify the climatic factors that best explain these declines; and (3) use current climate change models to project how a changing climate may affect pronghorn populations in the future. So far, researchers have found that precipitation is strongly linked to pronghorn population growth, and that under future climate scenarios, 9 of 18 studied populations are projected to disappear by the end of the century.   The results of this project will assist wildlife managers in developing the most appropriate management strategy for pronghorns in the face of climate change and future drought conditions, thus contributing to the long-term conservation of this species in the Southwest.

Unraveling the relationships between climate and population dynamics, and projecting them across time, advances ecological understanding that informs and steers sustainable conservation for species. Using pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) as an ecological model, we used a Bayesian approach to analyze long-term population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 subpopulations in the southwestern United States. We determined which long-term (12 and 24 months) or short-term (gestation trimester and lactation period) climatic conditions best predicted annual rate of population growth (\u03bb). We used these predictions to project population trends through 2090. Projections incorporated downscaled climatic data matched to pronghorn range for each population, given a high and a lower atmospheric CO2 concentration scenario. Since the 1990s, 15 of the pronghorn subpopulations declined in abundance. Sixteen subpopulations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and \u03bb, and in 13 of these, temperature was also significant. Precipitation predictors of \u03bb were highly seasonal, with lactation being the most important period, followed by early and late gestation. The influence of temperature on \u03bb was less seasonal than precipitation, and lacked a clear temporal pattern. The climatic projections indicated that all of these pronghorn subpopulations would experience increased temperatures, while the direction and magnitude of precipitation had high subpopulation-specific variation. Models predicted that nine subpopulations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. Results were consistent across both atmospheric CO2 concentration scenarios, indicating robustness of trends irrespective of climatic severity. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn subpopulations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence. This realization informs and steers conservation and management decisions for pronghorn in North America, while exemplifying how similar research can aid ungulates inhabiting arid regions and confronting similar circumstances elsewhere. Long-term data from annual aerial surveys of pronghorn subpopulations in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas were used to calculate annual rates of population growth (\u03bb). When subpopulation-specific harvest and translocation data were available, population estimates for calculating \u03bb were adjusted according to the following equation: \u03bbt = Nt/(Nt-1 - h - r + a), where \u03bbt is population change from time t-1 to t, Nt and Nt-1 are population estimates from current and previous surveys, respectively, h is number of pronghorn harvested, and r and a are number of individuals removed from and released into the population, respectively, through translocations. Only population estimates from surveys conducted in consecutive years were used to calculate \u03bb. If \u03bb = 2, the associated surveys were removed from analyses because \u03bb would be considered to be derived from unreliable or unstandardized population estimates, resulting in biologically unrealistic population growth rates. Monthly climate data (precipitation [mm/day] and mean temperature [degrees C]) were from 14 x 14 km cells from pronghorn range in each subpopulation in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas. Means across grids were calculated to obtain monthly values of precipitation and temperature. Two realistic future global climate scenarios were compared; a lower (Representative Concentrations Pathways 4.5) and a high (Representative Concentrations Pathways 8.5) atmospheric CO2 concentration scenario. Standardized precipitation index for 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month periods were calculated from all available monthly precipitation data using program SPI SL 6 (National Drought Mitigation Center 2014). Monthly mean temperature, total precipitation, and mean SPI (3-, 6-, and 12-month periods) were summarized by important periods in an adult female pronghorn's annual reproductive cycle relative to peak fawning (i.e., early, mid-, and late gestation [3 months each] and lactation [4 months]). Mean temperature and total precipitation were also calculated for 12 and 24 months preceding each population survey. Historic pronghorn population trends in relation to temperature and precipitation were assessed using integrated Bayesian population models. All models included a covariate for density effect (i.e., population in the previous year). Precipitation and temperature model comparison sets were run separately, and each model set included a null model (i.e., only density covariate, no climate covariates). These top individual precipitation and temperature covariates were then combined in models (i.e., one precipitation and temperature covariate per model), and these combined models were run including a term for the interaction between precipitation and temperature using the following equation: ln(\u03bbt) = Alpha + Beta1XN[t-1] + Beta2Xprec + Beta3Xtemp + Beta4Xprec*temp. Projected climate data for each pronghorn subpopulation was used to predict \u03bbt for each year to 2090. An integrated modeling approach was used, whereby the best performing model climatic predictors from historic population trends for each pronghorn subpopulation was embedded in that subpopulation pronghorn population projection model. The pronghorn population survey data were collected to estimate annual rate of population growth (\u03bb) for subpopulations described herein. Historic climate data (precipitation and temperature) were compiled to determine climatic predictors of annual rates of pronghorn population growth.

Yet, key research gaps currently prevent existing soil moisture measurements from being used to assess drought conditions and mitigate drought impacts such as wildfire outbreaks, lost agricultural production, and degraded wildlife habitat. In fact, most scales used to characterize the severity of drought, known as \u201cdrought indices\u201d, don\u2019t include soil moisture measurements, relying instead on atmospheric data. Current barriers to the incorporation of soil moisture data include a lack of consensus regarding how to best construct soil moisture-based drought indices, the challenges associated with integrating existing soil moisture data collected from diverse networks, and a lack of guidelines on how to apply these indices to different crop types.  The objective of this project is to build the necessary scientific foundation for soil moisture-based drought monitoring in the South Central region and beyond. This project will produce effective soil moisture-based drought indices that decision-makers can use retrospectively or in real-time with data from existing monitoring networks to assess drought severity in the South Central region or across the US. Researchers will also create the first regional soil moisture database for the South Central US, which will further support drought monitoring and other climate-related research efforts in this drought-prone region. This improved monitoring capability will facilitate early detection and the implementation of adaptive management strategies, which research has shown are key to reducing the economic and ecological impacts of drought.

This project was designed to address this limitation by bringing together expertise in the social and communication sciences from targeted academic institutions affiliated with the Department of the Interior\u2019s Climate Science Centers (CSCs) through a workshop.  The project team brought together expertise in the social and communication sciences from targeted academic institutions, particularly experts and scholars who are affiliated with the nation\u2019s CSCs, by means of an invited workshop. The purpose of this effort was to bring together such a group but also to focus experts in the nation\u2019s CSCs on how these Centers\u2019 affiliates can more effectively communicate the science of this important but often misunderstood problem and meaningfully inform effective policy in each region.  The workshop involved formal presentations from experts in a variety of disciplines on the problem of climate change and how to more effectively communicate the science of this problem. Specifically, the presentations focused on the scientific, policy, and political aspects of climate change and how to communicate its scientific essentials, as well as, its implications to the general public and policy makers, both bureaucratic and elected.

Extreme winter storms, including those linked to atmospheric rivers, are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as a result of climate change. The goal of this project is to identify how these extreme events impact ecosystems and communities across the Southwest. To do this, researchers used a historical chronology of atmospheric river events that made landfall along the West Coast during 23 recent years, relating these events to how they have affected precipitation, vegetation, and wildfire characteristics across the Southwest.   The results of this study will provide critical information enabling resource managers to anticipate and prepare for the potential impacts of extreme precipitation events in the future.

Relatively less is known about the ecological implications of ARs, particularly in the interior Southwest, where AR storms are less common. To address this gap, we compared a chronology of AR landfalls on the west coast between 1989-2011 and between 25-42.5\u00baN, to annual metrics of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; an indicator of vegetation productivity) and daily-resolution precipitation data to assess influences of AR-fed winter precipitation on vegetation productivity across the southwestern US. We mapped correlations between winter AR precipitation during landfalling ARs and 1) annual maximum NDVI and 2) area burned by large wildfires summarized by ecoregion during the same year as the landfalls and during the following year. The data produced by this study include four sets of eight raster grids (total = 32 grids) representing Spearman Rank correlation coefficients for four types of comparisons across eight different latitudinal bands. Each dataset is named according to the comparison type and latitude of AR landfall. The four types of comparisons (with corresponding filenames indicated in parentheses) include: 1) annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. total annual winter precipitation (AR_WinterPrecip), 2) annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. annual maximum NDVI (AR_NDVI), 3) spatially-averaged annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. area burned by wildfire during the same year by Level IV ecoregion (AR_Fire_SameYear), and 4) spatially-averaged annual winter atmospheric river precipitation vs. area burned by wildfire with a 1-year lag by Level IV ecoregion (AR_Fire_OneYearLag). The eight landfall latitudes are indicated in filenames as follows: 25N, 27_5N, 30N, 32_5N, 35N, 37_5_N, 40N, 42_5N. Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are a major mechanism for water vapor transport from the tropics to mid-latitudes that strongly influence precipitation in western North America and elsewhere in the world. This study assesses historical relations between landfalling ARs and interannual variations in vegetation biomass production and associated fuels accumulation in the Southwest. The relations identified are stratified in terms of AR landfall latitude, the influence of topographic barriers, and across ecosystem types. As climatologists\u2019 understanding of the synoptic patterns associated with the occurrence of ARs continues to evolve, an increased understanding of how AR landfalls, in aggregate, influence

There is a growing body of evidence that suggests inland fisheries have disproportionate importance for impoverished countries. However, the United Nations\u2019 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), do not explicitly include inland fisheries.

In order to achieve the SDGs, measurable targets and indicators have been outlined. The goal of this project is to examine the relationships between inland fisheries systems, services, and actions with all 169 SDG targets. By assessing these relationships, researchers will identify how achieving the SDGs would impact inland fisheries and how inland fisheries can contribute to achieving the SDGs.

These changes have direct implications for economically important wildlife, such as deer and waterfowl. Deer hunting alone contributes $482 million annually to Wisconsin\u2019s economy.   The goal of this project is to identify how winter severity, snowpack, and lake ice could change through the mid- and late-21st century, and how species such as the white-tailed deer and mallard duck will respond. Because currently available climate data is at too coarse a scale to provide information on future conditions for the Great Lakes, researchers transformed these models from a global-scale to a regional-scale.    Using these models, researchers found that the region could experience substantial warming, reduced lake ice cover, and increased precipitation, with more precipitation falling as rain than snow, among other changes. Snow/ice cover limit foraging by waterfowl, thereby regulating the timing/intensity of migration and their distributions during non-breeding season. Reductions in weather severity could result in delayed autumn-winter migration for dabbling ducks, which would increase foraging pressures on wetlands in the Great Lakes region \u2013 highlighting the importance of protecting these wetlands. These changes in migration patterns could also lead to potentially significant economic losses in southern flyway states, as ducks may stay in the Great Lakes region during the winter months. The primary wintertime stressors for deer are air chill and snow depth, with extreme winters triggering population declines.  Changes in wildlife abundance and distribution can incur dramatic ecological, societal, and economic impacts. Warming may support expanded deer populations and overgrazing, while elevating infectious disease threats to deer. Annually in the U.S., 13.4 million people participate in deer and migratory bird hunting, generating $21.5 billion in revenue, with the hunting industry supporting 681,000 jobs.    Predictions of the future distribution of ducks and other wildlife in the region will help guide the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Ducks Unlimited, and other stakeholders in developing conservation and adaptation strategies for vulnerable species and in mitigating the potential economic losses that might result from changes in species distribution.

As a result, research on the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation in driving droughts and surface water variability in the Missouri River Basin has lagged behind similar work done in other major basins in the country, and has hindered drought planning efforts.   To address this need, researchers will use tree-rings to develop reconstructions of historic, natural streamflow in the Upper Missouri River Basin. This will be the first such network of hydrologic reconstructions for the basin. Specifically, the tree-ring analysis will provide information on precipitation, temperature, and streamflow for the basin going back 800 years. This historical information will then be used to explore the drivers of drought and periods of high flow in the basin, beyond just precipitation. For example, evidence suggests that temperature is an increasingly important driver of drought, and an analysis of the impacts of warming temperatures on streamflow can be used to help managers anticipate future impacts on water supplies in the basin. Lastly, researchers will work closely with engineers and water managers with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to integrate information on droughts and natural variability in streamflow into their water operations and drought planning efforts. Through this effort, researchers will seek to address questions such as \u201cwhat are the impacts to current water operations under severe droughts, like the 1930s Dust Bowl or 1500s megadrought?\u201d and \u201chow could operations be changed to improve water management for droughts like these, given projected future warming?\u201d.

The code was developed in the R programming environment. The file \"sim_code.R\" contains the initialization of the parameters and analysis; the file \"pop_sim.ccp\" is a C++ program that executes the actual simulation and returns the results to R. We developed a hypothetical scenario in which a manager is tasked with control of invasive plants on 100 management units each 100 ha in size. 90 of these units were assumed to be under private management and 10 were assumed to be conservation units (i.e. under public management). For this problem we assumed that there were only two target species to control: leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) and yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris). These two species were identified of examples of species that are controlled within the LCC geography. They are also species for which there is some literature to help parameterize a model. We should note that this model is gross generalization and was not intended to provide insight into invasive species biology. Because this model is stochastic, we measured this objective as the number of years out of 50 that at least 50% of the units were uninfested. We arbitrarily chose the target of 50%, which could have been any value. However, we felt that because these species are so difficult to control, target of 50% was fairly attainable. The dynamics of the model assume that management units can either be infested with one of the species, both of them or none at all. We further assumed that once a unit was infested, the species immediately achieved some average density and began producing propagules. These propagules had to disperse some arbitrary distance before they could infest another unit. Once those seeds landed in an uninfested unit, there was some probability they would lead to an infestation. To describe infestation dynamics, we developed a model that was composed of eight states to describe the management units. The model simulates the dynamics of infestation and control and then produces an Expected Value of Information analysis that shows the improvement in performance given resolution of each uncertain parameter in the model.

These changes in the distribution of wildlife populations present challenges for wildlife managers, hunters, tribal communities, and others who are making decisions about wildlife stewardship.  This project examined the effect of shifting climate conditions on 20 species of conservation concern in the South Central United States. These species, which include the black-tailed prairie dog and the lesser prairie-chicken, were selected according to several criteria, including their expected sensitivity to climatic change. Researchers examined where these species currently occur in order to better understand the environmental, especially climate, conditions necessary for their survival. Climate and land use change projections for 2050 and 2070 were used to assess the potential future distributions of conditions suitable for these species.  Maps evaluating patterns of loss of suitable conditions for the species were developed and incorporated into the publicly accessible New Mexico state-level CHAT (Crucial Habitat Assessment Tool). CHATs are being used by states across the western U.S. to facilitate conservation and project planning, and are useful to decision-makers at all levels of government. Therefore, incorporating information about the potential impact of climate and land use change on species distributions into this tool will ensure that this important information is accessible to managers.

It also is projected that there will be fewer wet days per year, with more precipitation falling on those wet days. Such climatic extremes can strongly affect wild animals and plants, ecosystems, and humans. In the Southwest, more frequent and intense storms may negatively affect protected species in coastal salt marshes; changes in the timing and amount of precipitation could lead to increases in fuel loads; and increasingly humid heat waves could lead to higher incidence of heat-related illness among visitors to national parks.   This project will improve understanding of climate extremes and their potential effects in the Southwest. Researchers will assess a suite of models that project future global climate and determine which of those models best represent climate patterns and extremes in the Southwest. Researchers will then downscale the best models, a process that allows the models to be used for regional analyses, and will project past and future extreme temperature and precipitation. The downscaled climate data will be fed into a hydrologic model, the results of which can be used to assess future water availability and the probability of floods and droughts. Additionally, data on projected regional climate and climate extremes will be made available through an online interactive platform.

Challenges these coastal communities face include sea level rise, erosion, saltwater intrusion, flooding, droughts, and coral bleaching which in turn affect food and water security, infrastructure, and the health of humans and ecosystems. These small islands also have limited resources; therefore, managing them effectively is important to ensure sustainable communities and healthy environments. To support natural resource management, accurate, detailed, up-to-date geospatial data and products are vital to help monitor these resources, identify potential threats, and reveal potential solutions.   Through this project, the University of Guam (UoG) Center for Island Sustainability (CIS) is working with partners in the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI) to provide needed regional geospatial technical assistance to the USAPI of Micronesia and to define potential impacts of climate change on natural, physical, and cultural resources, and related outcomes and endpoints for climate adaptation efforts.   This project has three primary objectives: (1) drafting of a USAPI-focused plan identifying opportunities for implementing the Pacific Island CSC\u2019s Strategic Science Plan for future years as well as the current year; (2) developing written reports that demonstrate translation of regional climate science to formats useable by resource management or community planning, and (3) a report and/or demonstration product describing a framework for geospatial training to increase USAPI capacity.

Today, sea-level rise, more frequent and stronger storms, saltwater intrusion, and warming water temperatures are among the threats that are altering these important habitats.   Much of the existing research on anticipating the effects of changing conditions on coastal ecosystems relies on global or regional scale data, meaning that the detailed information necessary for local-scale decision making is often not available. Building on data collected by previous Southwest CSC research, this project focuses on local-scale monitoring of coastal habitats in California to capture current trends and effects of storm events and inundation, and to inform more detailed projections of the impacts of future changes. Researchers are working closely with federal, state, and local management agencies throughout the process, from data collection to results sharing.    So far, results suggest that moderate to high rates of sea-level rise would result in a loss of coastal wetlands, with implications for the ecosystem services that these ecosystems provide \u2013 such as wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, improved water quality, and coastal protection from storms. The results provide detailed information that can be used by California\u2019s coastal land managers to understand the vulnerability of specific sites to changing conditions, enabling decision-makers to effectively implement adaptive management strategies that will sustain the critical function of coastal habitats.

There is ample literature on the effects of long-term climate change and short-term climate variability on the occurrence of droughts. However, it is unclear whether this information meets the needs of relevant stakeholders and actually contributes to reducing the vulnerability or increasing the resilience of communities to droughts. For example, are the methods used to characterize the severity of drought \u2013 known as drought indices \u2013 effective tools for predicting the actual damage felt by communities?   As droughts continue to increase in frequency and severity, the need to understand community vulnerability and resilience to drought is only growing. Focusing on New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, this study sought to answer several key questions. First, researchers examined whether existing drought indices are effective in predicting the occurrence of drought events and their actual damages. Second, researchers explored why some communities suffer less damage from drought and recover faster than others. Finally, researchers identified strategies for encouraging the adoption of water conservation behaviors among residents. So far, results show that drought indices are overall useful tools for predicting drought damage and that a community\u2019s resilience to drought is often tied to socioeconomic conditions.   This research was conducted in partnership with two Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. In addition to gaining the scientific knowledge of the linkages between drought indices, damages, and community resilience, this research (1) developed tools to measure drought resilience, (2) identified key indicators of resilience, (3) identified the gaps between drought indices and actual damages, and (4) identified the factors that influence residents\u2019 decisions to adopt adaptive measures.

Although ample literature exists on the climatological aspects of drought, little is known on whether existing drought indices can predict the damages and how different human communities respond and adapt to the hazard. This project examines (1) whether existing drought indices can predict the occurrence of drought events and their actual damages; (2) how the adaptive capacity (i.e., resilience) varies across space; and (3) what public outreach and engagement effort would be most effective for mitigation of risk and impacts. The study region includes all 503 counties in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. This data set was created to examine the first objective of the project. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI) data, available only at the climate-division level, were downscaled into county-level indices over the 1975-2010 period. The drought damage data, acquired from the Spatial Hazards Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUSTM), were tabulated for the same time period. Statistical correlations were conducted between drought indices and drought damages to test whether these indices accurately represent the drought damage in the study region. This data set contains the two county-level drought indices and drought damage for the period 1975-2010, which should be useful to future related studies. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI) are publicly available data, collected from Midwestern Regional Climate Center (MRCC), which mainly originate from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The PDSI and PHDI are published weekly and aggregated into a monthly dataset by NOAA, at the climate divisional level. Although several drought indices are available; which captures somewhat different aspects of drought conditions (Heim 2000), the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI; Palmer 1965) and Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI; Karl 1986) are commonly used, highly regarded, and readily available metrics. The PDSI, a weekly index of long-term moisture conditions, is produced by NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center and is calibrated to \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 conditions for its own subset of a state known as a climate division, with 0.0 representing average soil moisture conditions at that climate division for that time of year. Positive values represent above-normal moisture conditions for that location and negative values suggest below-normal soil moisture. Because the water balance calculations for PDSI include lags to take into account deep soil moisture conditions, PDSI is often considered in many applications a reasonable and versatile index of medium-term moisture. For evaluating longer-term hydrological conditions, the PHDI may prove more useful, because it's even longer-lagged response to changes in moisture conditions may better reflect the changes in groundwater availability and reservoir supplies that would be characteristic of drought impacts on communities\u2019 long-term water supply and demand (Guttman 1991). These two indices remain the most widely used and cited measures of drought. The versatility and availability of the PDSI and PHDI on a near-real-time basis make these two indices most desirable for use by environmental planners.

Rising global air temperatures are altering the characteristics of aquatic ecosystems worldwide, including freshwater in the United States. Understanding the vulnerability of aquatic species and habitats to changing conditions is critical for conservation and management of these important natural resources.

These objectives were designed to address decision support needs for climate adaptation and resource management actions. Specifically, understanding of uncertainty in climate projections - in particular for extreme events - is currently a key scientific and management barrier to adaptation planning and vulnerability assessment. The new dataset fills in the Northwest domain to cover a key gap in the previous dataset, adds additional projections (both from other global climate models and a comparison with dynamical downscaling) and includes an assessment of changes to flow and soil moisture extremes. This new information can be used to assess variations in impacts across the landscape, uncertainty in projections, and how these differ as a function of region, variable, and time period.  In this project, existing University of Washington Climate Impacts Group (UW CIG) products were extended to develop a comprehensive data archive that accounts (in a rigorous and physically based way) for climate model uncertainty in future climate and hydrologic scenarios. These products can be used to determine likely impacts on vegetation and aquatic habitat in the Pacific Northwest region, including WA, OR, ID, northwest MT to the continental divide, northern CA, NV, UT, and the Columbia Basin portion of western WY.

This region contains millions of wetlands in which waterfowl breed and from which 50-80% of the continent's migratory ducks originate each year.  Previous modeling efforts indicated that climate change would result in a shift of suitable waterfowl breeding habitat from the central PPR to the southeastern portion of the region, an area where the majority of wetlands have been drained. If this future scenario were to materialize, a significant restoration effort would be needed in the southeastern PPR to support waterfowl production. However, more recent research has revealed that changes in climate are influencing these critical wetland habitats in novel ways, and previous modeling results may no longer be valid. Land and natural resource managers are in need of more accurate, up-to-date scientific information in order to make fully informed planning decisions about these important wetlands and waterfowl habitat.  This project aims to improve our understanding of how future climate changes might impact wetland ecosystems and waterfowl habitats of the PPR. Project researchers are using a newly developed wetland simulation model to simulate hydrologic and chemical conditions of prairie pothole wetlands under various climate change scenarios. Results will be compared to results from previous modeling and analysis efforts to gain a better understanding of future impacts to wetlands and the ability of prairie pothole wetlands to continue meeting the habitat needs of breeding waterfowl. Throughout this effort, the project team is working directly with land managers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Habitat and Population Evaluation Team and Chase Lake Wetland Management District in North Dakota to ensure that study results and science products can directly inform climate adaptation plans for waterfowl habitat.

Researchers will improve the model by developing better estimates of the frequency of storm events that would result in saltwater inundation of forts and historic buildings at the park. Researchers will also bring together managers and technical experts to evaluate the science-based information needs related to sediment dynamics in the Gulf Islands National Seashore region, and to explore paths forward for addressing these needs.

Persistent drought is further affecting agricultural production in the RMI. Many Marshallese communities are already experiencing these changes and are migrating to larger islands within the RMI and to other countries like the U.S. to, among other things, seek alternative means of making a living and access healthcare.  The number of Marshallese residing in the U.S. has rapidly risen over the past two decades, from 7,000 in 2000 to 22,000 in 2010. There is also substantial internal migration, mainly from outer islands to the main atoll of Majuro. However, we do not know to what extent Marshallese people are already migrating because of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services\u2014nor do we know whether this migration can be regarded as a successful adaptation strategy. The factors triggering human migration are complex and often intertwined, making it difficult to pinpoint and address specific causes from a public policy perspective. For example, changes in ecosystems due to climate change can cause health problems or food insecurity, which may have greater consequences in communities with political, social, or economic tension. Decision makers at local and state levels in both the RMI and U.S.\u2014for example those who design policy related to immigrant access to services\u2014need information to better understand the factors contributing to current migration and to anticipate possible future impacts of climate on human migration. Also, a better understanding is needed of how migration impacts livelihoods and well being in the island to which migrants arrive and in the areas in which they settle.  This research project will study the nature of Marshallese migration and its effects on migrants, themselves, and communities in source and destination areas. There are three central research questions:    \tTo what extent are climatic stressors, and their impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods and habitability, already driving migration in RMI? \tWhat are the impacts of migration in source and destinations areas? \tHow do migration reasons and consequences vary among different types of respondents?  This project will examine the extent to which we can identify direct and indirect links between patterns of human migration and climate events. As a next step, the projects\u2019 research findings on migration decision-making could be integrated into agent-based models that use projections of climate change and its impact on ecosystem services to understand which islands and communities are at highest risk and from where we can expect most migration to take place in the future.

To make matters worse, it is also expected to shift the range of many species, forcing animals capable of adapting by moving to expand into new areas to find more suitable temperatures and adequate food supplies \u2013 a challenge made difficult, if not impossible, by disconnected landscapes. Maintaining connectivity between habitats is a key strategy for conserving wildlife populations into the future, and sound science is needed to inform conservation decisions.  Scientists with the SE CSC, in partnership with the South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative, assessed current and projected connectivity for three species that inhabit bottomland hardwood forests, a habitat of high conservation concern: American black bear, Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bat, and timber rattlesnake. Not surprisingly, the study results suggest that under anticipated climate conditions, there will be fewer connections for species to move between suitable habitats.  Moreover, the findings reveal that the connectedness of a future landscape will be species specific. For example, what may be sufficiently connected for a black bear to easily traverse long distances might well prove to be disconnected for a rattlesnake. This suggests a limited ability for managers to use the \u201cumbrella species\u201d concept to make generalized management decisions. The team additionally found that connectivity projections differ based on the model and method being used. Researchers suggest that managers and others use multiple techniques and focus on multiple species to get a more holistic, accurate representation of how species will use a particular landscape in the future and how connections between and among habitats can be strengthened most effectively.

While rising temperatures can create drought conditions that favor severe fires, it is also possible that drought limits the ability of trees to survive a fire. During a drought, there is less water available for trees and more outbreaks of harmful insects and pathogens can occur, both of which can weaken trees. Tree mortality is one means of measuring the severity of a fire, and evidence shows that trees exposed to drought conditions for periods of 5-10 years are already more sensitive to the effects of fire \u2013 suggesting that drought could indeed increase fire severity.   This project will examine the poorly understood relationship between drought, fire, and tree mortality in the Southwest. Researchers will use existing data on controlled burns, tree-ring analysis, and detailed climate data to determine how these variables interact. Understanding how drought and fire might work together to cause tree death is critical. More dead trees translates into poorer habitat for wildlife, increased soil erosion, and greater carbon emissions following fires \u2013 which could worsen warming trends.   The warming experienced so far in the Southwest is small compared to expected future conditions, making this analysis critical for the success of long-term forest conservation. Identifying exactly how drought and fire interact to impact trees can help forest managers better understand and plan for the effects of fire in the future.

The processes that produce thermokarst can lead to significant changes within the surrounding ecosystems, altering water quality, vegetation, and water, carbon, and nutrient storage and flows. These changes can have substantial implications for fish and wildlife populations and disrupt rural communities and infrastructure.   The goal of this project was to better understand the extent of thermokarst processes and the rate at which they are happening under climate change in northern Alaska. Researchers used a combination of mapping, literature review, and consultations with wildlife experts to assess thermokarst extent; possible impacts on fish, wildlife, and habitats; and the strengths and weaknesses of current and past efforts to monitor thermokarst. Researchers used these insights to develop and propose a plan for monitoring thermokarst on the North Slope of Alaska, a means to supply information that will build understanding of how climate change is reshaping the region\u2019s landscape and living things.

Despite its naturally warm waters, the basin supports abundant redband trout. These are some of the largest-bodied trout in the entire U.S., and are a culturally and economically important species, providing the last remaining subsistence fishery for the Klamath Tribes and drawing recreational anglers. The ability of this coldwater species to survive in one of the region\u2019s warmest watersheds could hold valuable clues for conservation in the face of warming global temperatures, which represents one of the biggest threats to North America\u2019s coldwater fish.  Previous research has found that redband trout rely heavily on spring-fed habitats. These springs provide pockets of cooler water for relief from extreme temperatures in the summer, and comparably warmer waters for spawning in the winter. Fish will migrate long distances to spawn in these habitats, sometimes 100 miles or more. However, there is currently a lack of information on how these \u201crefugia\u201d are used by fish throughout their life cycle. This prevents managers from understanding how refugia scale-up across the landscape and support fish at the population level. The goal of this project is to identify how redband trout use coldwater refugia at each life stage to survive extreme heat. Researchers will develop maps of existing spring-fed habitats and the life-stages that each supports, in addition to maps of currently impaired spring-fed habitats and the life-stages that they would likely support if restored.  This information will be critical for restoration planners, including those with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Trout Unlimited, and the Klamath Tribes, as they refine strategic approaches for ensuring that key cold water habitats are protected and restored. For example, the results will be incorporated into two of the most important habitat restoration plans in the western U.S. - the Upper Klamath Basin Watershed Action Plan and the Klamath Anadromous Fish Reintroduction Implementation Plan.

However, other wetland-dependent birds also rely on this region, and it is important to understand the degree to which habitat conserved for ducks provides habitat for other species, and how the quality of this habitat will be affected by climate change. Project researchers will test whether waterfowl are effective representatives, or surrogates, for other wetland-dependent birds by predicting how climate change will affect habitat suitability for waterfowl and other species. The team will also consider how climate change is likely to affect land-use patterns and agricultural conversion risk, and use these predictions to identify areas of the landscape where both waterfowl and other species are expected to have suitable habitat in the future.

This region provides critical breeding and migratory habitat for waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species, and is also a highly productive agricultural region. Generally, the regional effects projected by climate models are increasing temperatures and more variable precipitation, which could provide incentives for private landowners to convert native and managed grassland to intensive cropland. Conversion of grassland to cropland can result in habitat loss for dependent species and the degradation of a range of ecosystem services. If climate change alters the spatial distribution of both agricultural land use and suitable habitat, land managers and conservationists may need to alter efforts to offset the negative consequences of combined climate and land-use change on habitats and dependent species. The land-use change projections associated with this report provide information for such management efforts. The purpose of this project was to estimate and map the probability that grassland converts to cropland in the northern plains and prairie region given potential climate change. This region, which spans portions of Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, provides critical breeding and migratory habitat for waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species, and is also a highly productive agricultural region. Planning for the effects of climate change in this region is a high priority for the Plains and Prairie Pothole LCC and managers at federal, regional, and local levels (e.g. North American Waterfowl Management Plan 2012). Climate models for the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) project increasing temperatures and little to no increases in precipitation (though potentially more variability), leading to reductions in wetland habitat through increased evapotranspiration (Johnson et al. 2010). Populations of waterfowl and other species often decrease during droughts (Sorenson et al. 1998), raising concerns that hunting opportunities could be compromised and that the long-term viability of non-game populations may be at risk. Changes in climate can also have indirect effects on biodiversity by driving changes in human land use. Warmer temperatures, resulting in longer crop growing seasons and changes in crop yields, could incentivize landowners to alter their land-management practices or to transition from less intensive grassland uses to intensive row crop production (Rashford et al. 2010), which alters habitats and wetland functions (Rashford et al. 2016). Understanding the full effect of climate change on habitat therefore requires accounting for both the direct (e.g., increased evapotranspiration) and indirect effects (e.g., land-use change)

The project researchers performed two field experiments to examine the accuracy of temperature observations from three commonly used portable data loggers (HOBO Pro, HOBO Pendant, and iButton hygrochron) housed in manufactured Gill shields or ad-hoc, custom-fabricated shields constructed from everyday materials such as plastic cups. They installed replicates of this array of sensors (11 sensor-shield combinations) at 5 different sites at weather stations located in open and forested sites. The team found that HOBO Pro sensors with Gill shields were the most accurate devices. Error in ad-hoc shield treatments ranged from 0.8 to 3.0 \u00b0C, with the largest errors at the open site.  They also deployed one replicate of each sensor-shield combination at five sites that varied in the amount of urban impervious surface cover, which presents a further shielding challenge. Results showed that bias in the sensors with ad-hoc shields increased by up to 0.7 \u00b0C for every 10% increase in impervious surface.  This study shows that, due to variable shielding practices, the ecological literature likely includes highly biased temperature data that cannot be compared directly across studies.

Previous work has identified which atmospheric circulation patterns are associated with extreme events, information which can help refine forecasts and downscale future climate projections. The goal of this project is to test whether these patterns hold true for all days that experience extreme weather. So far, researchers have found that not all extreme days are created equal. Some extreme climate events, such as very warm summer days, routinely occur under the expected atmospheric circulation patterns, and those circulation patterns are almost always associated with extreme climate events. However, other extreme events, such as cold summer days, can occur under a much wider range of circulation patterns.

For example, plants might be relocated to support pollinator conservation or the restoration of prairies. Some land managers, in an effort to be proactive in the face of changing environmental conditions, are also considering relocating plants to sites that are considered more similar to anticipated future conditions. However, moving plants can be ecologically and economically risky. It\u2019s possible that pests, pathogens, or contaminant weeds can be inadvertently moved along with the target plant material. In 2016, the noxious weed Palmer amaranth was introduced to Minnesota as a contaminant in seed brought in to improve Monarch butterfly and pollinator habitat. This fast growing weed is capable of reducing soybean yields by 78% and corn yields by 91%, and requires costly resources to fight its spread.   One factor that impacts the risk associated with plant movement is the distance between the source of the plant and where it is being relocated to. If the source is located near the translocation site, it is less likely to be contaminated with new weeds or pathogens. The goal of this project is to create a framework for evaluating risk associated with the movement of plant material. The first tier of the framework will describe the future condition of the species, site, or community of concern, if plant movement is implemented and if it is not. The second tier will assess the ecological risks associated with moving plant material. This will include identifying potential pathogens, weeds, and pests that might be associated with plants from different areas and could be inadvertently introduced during translocation, and evaluating the potential harm these species might cause if introduced. The benefit of such a framework will be to greatly reduce the likelihood of unintended introductions of pests and noxious species. It will also take into account the ability of plants to adapt to expected future environmental conditions in their new locations. This work will support a range of stakeholders, including private, state, federal, and non-profit land managers who undertake planting for conservation or restoration.

The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) is a group of islands of great conservation importance that is threatened by sea-level rise. Stretching 2,000 km beyond the main Hawaiian Islands, the NWHI are a World Heritage Site and part of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument. The islands support the largest tropical seabird rookery in the world, providing breeding habitat for 21 species of seabirds, 4 land bird species, and essential habitat for other resident and migratory wildlife. Because these are low-lying islands, even small increases in sea-level could result in the loss of critical habitat, increasing the risk of extinctions of species that are found nowhere else in the world.   The goal of this project was to provide managers with critical information on the vulnerability of the islands and the species that inhabit them to sea-level rise. Researchers used high-resolution topographic and vegetation models to predict the impacts of a range of sea-level rise scenarios on 20 islands. Results showed that a sea-level rise of +1 m would result in the loss of 4% of the total land area in the NWHI, while a rise of +2 m would result in the loss of 26% of the total land area and could leave 7 islands completely submerged. Researchers then explored the potential implications of sea-level rise for wildlife breeding habitats on each island. A loss of 4% of land area could leave more than 200,000 seabirds without nesting habitat. Species with limited distributions are especially vulnerable, such as the Laysan Finch, Black-footed Albatross, Laysan Albatross, and Hawaiian monk seal.   Understanding the vulnerability of these islands and their wildlife to sea-level rise will help managers determine the best course of action for helping these species persist in the face of climate change.

Unfortunately, many of these ecosystems are increasingly under threat due to rapid human development, and management agencies are increasingly aware of the potential effects that climate change will have on these ecosystems. Natural resource managers and conservation planners can be effective at preserving ecosystems in the face of these stressors only if they can adapt current conservation efforts to increase the overall resilience of the system. Climate change, in particular, challenges many of the basic assumptions used by conservation planners and managers. Previous conservation planning efforts identified and prioritized areas for conservation based on the current environmental conditions, such as habitat quality, and assumed that conditions in conservation lands would be largely controlled by management actions (including no action). Climate change, however, will likely alter important system drivers (temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise) and make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain recent historic conditions in conservation lands into the future. Climate change will also influence the future conservation potential of non-conservation lands, further complicating conservation planning. Therefore, there is a need to develop and adapt effective conservation strategies to cope with the effects of climate and landscape change on future environmental conditions.  Traditional urban growth models are very localized and data-intensive and lack the capability to be applied across large regions. In response to these limitations the North Carolina Cooperative Research Unit began using the USGS SLEUTH urban growth model to develop urbanization scenarios as part of the Southeast Regional Assessment Project (SERAP). Extensive modifications of the model framework and calibration were undertaken that resulted in the ability to rapidly develop urbanization scenarios for very large regions, such as the Appalachian, Caribbean, and Gulf Coastal Plain Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). This new modeling effort allows LCC\u2019s to address fundamental questions that affect conservation planning over decadal time scales.

The SAMBI DSL project used predicted urban growth models described herein to inform future landscape conditions that were also based climate change impacts and vegetative community succession. These future landscape conditions were then applied as a context for land use and management decisions in conservation planning.  SLEUTH, named for the model input datasets (Slope, Land use, Excluded, Urban, Transportation and Hillshade) is the evolutionary product of the Clarke Urban Growth Model that uses cellular automata, terrain mapping and land cover change modeling to address urban growth (Jantz et al, 2009; NCGIA 2011). SLEUTH provides urban growth projections which are useful across a range of applications; including wildlife habitat analysis, conservation planning, and land cover dynamics analysis. SLEUTH incorporates four growth rules (Spontaneous Growth, New Spreading Centers, Edge Growth and Road-Influenced Growth) to model the rate and pattern of urbanization. The model simulates not only outward growth of existing urban areas, but also growth along transportation corridors and new centers of urbanization. SLEUTH incorporates five parameters (Dispersion, Breed, Spread, Slope and Road Gravity) into the growth rules which project future urbanization. Possible parameter coefficient values range between 1 and 100. During calibration every possible combination of these five parameter coefficients (between defined start and stop values and by a defined step size) is applied to the growth rules, in order to find the combination that best matches past urbanization patterns observed in the training data. Once found, the model is run in prediction mode using these parameter values in the growth rules. The model produces one urban growth cycle per year. For each growth cycle, a GIF image is produced showing the probability of urbanization for each pixel.

These changes will have consequences for inland fish \u2013 those found within lakes, rivers, streams, canals, reservoirs, and other landlocked waters \u2013 which are important for food, commerce, and recreation around the world. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in 2011, 33.1 million people fished and spent $41.8 billion in the United States alone. Yet to date, little comprehensive research has been conducted to investigate the effects of climate change on inland fisheries at a large scale.    The aim of this project was to summarize the current state of knowledge, identify data gaps, and suggest future research directions around four major themes dealing with climate related impacts on fishes and fisheries. To answer these questions, researchers lead a workshop for experts in climate change and fish ecology from universities, state and provincial governments, and federal agencies throughout the U.S. and Canada. Together, the experts compiled the findings of 48 studies, mainly focused on salmon and trout, and solicited feedback from inland fishery experts around the world.  The findings of this effort show that climate change is poised to impact inland fish in a variety of ways. For example, some fish, especially coldwater species such as brook trout, will likely become stressed by the new conditions, while others (e.g., smallmouth bass) may thrive. These results provide a baseline of current knowledge on inland fisheries and climate change that can inform future research and help focus conservation efforts.

Propelled by strong winds, cloud droplets are driven onto the stems and leaves of plants where they are deposited. Some of the water that accumulates on the plants in this way drips to the ground, adding additional water over and above the water supplied by rainfall. Prior observations show that the amount of cloud water intercepted by vegetation is substantial, but also quite variable from place to place. It is, therefore, important to create a map for the complex spatial patterns of cloud water interception (CWI) in Hawai\u2018i. In this project, we propose to create the CWI map at 0.8-km resolution based on the 20-year present-day climate simulations using the Hawai\u2019i Regional Climate Model (HRCM) equipped with a well-tested fog deposition scheme. The map will be verified against measurements at five representative observational sites across the Hawaiian Islands. We will also assess the projected changes in the CWI patterns in Hawai\u2019i by the later 21st century under both weak and strong global warming scenarios.

It flows south from the snow-capped mountains of Colorado through the New Mexico desert, forms the border between Texas and Mexico, and empties into the Gulf of Mexico at Brownsville, Texas. The multi-national, multi-state, ecologically diverse nature of this river makes management of the resource a complex task, especially in the context of more frequent droughts, changes in land use patterns, and increasing water use needs.  The purpose of this project was to review scientific monitoring and research reports and provide an overview of the state of the knowledge of the Upper Rio Grande-Rio Bravo Basin. The project researchers developed a report that synthesizes historical and geomorphic studies that describe the river\u2019s characteristics in the 1800s, its subsequent transformation caused by consumptive water use, dams, and physical manipulation of the channel, and a modern understanding of the natural and transformed flow regime. An extensive second section of the report focuses on aquatic ecology of the four major river segments of the Basin. In that section, the researchers summarize current understanding of the historical state compared to the contemporary state of the ecosystem, identify causes of ecosystem degradation, with an emphasis on those factors most affected by flow, and identify existing efforts to reverse ecosystem degradation, however intractable and dynamic these efforts may be. Finally, the project team summarizes the state of knowledge of potential \u201cknobs\u201d that can be \u201cturned\u201d relating an ecological response to some component of flow management. They also seek to identify information gaps.  Realizing the need to define novel, new targets for desirable ecosystems places a great challenge on applied river science. To date, river science is pursued piece meal and focused on discrete segments of the watershed. This work helps to build a connection between politically-acceptable water management compromises, and the environmental flows needed to achieve river ecosystem objectives.

Developing the basin-wide responses necessary for drought resilience throughout the Basin can be challenging in such a complex management context.  This project seeks to understand how different human and environmental factors affect ten sections of the Rio Grande in order to identify how management strategies and human uses of the river can be better coordinated.

Therefore, connectivity, or the ability of organisms to move among habitat patches, is a critical component of landscape health. In addition to influencing the sustainability of wildlife populations and communities, connectivity also contributes to the availability of ecosystem services. The goal of this project was to evaluate terrestrial connectivity across the South Central United States, with a focus on the impact of projected climate and land use changes.  The researchers addressed this goal using a variety of approaches, including evaluating connectivity of major habitat types (grasslands and forests), predicting future changes in landscape connectivity for grassland species, assessing terrestrial vertebrate diversity in relation to habitat loss and fragmentation, and analyzing the combined effects of climate and habitat fragmentation on the distributions of grassland bird species.  They found that connectivity has declined for species with a low to moderate ability to move across the landscape, and that this pattern is expected to continue under future scenarios of land-use change. For grassland birds, the contribution of climate, landscape variables, and their combined effects varied among species, but their combined effects can exceed the independent effects of the two drivers for some species. Thus, the importance of connectivity is expected to increase with the negative implications of climate change for wildlife populations and communities. These results, which are expressed in maps, can be used to inform management decisions and identify future research needs related to terrestrial connectivity within this region.

Scenario A1B emphasizes economic growth with a global orientation and scenario B2 focuses on environmental sustainability with a regional view. Our study area included counties within the southern Great Plains ecoregion in Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. We calculated changes in landscape connectivity (dECA) between 2011 and 2050 for different species groups and landscape scenarios. We also calculated changes in habitat suitability (dA). We assessed the degree to which changes in landscape connectivity were influenced by changes in grassland cover (i.e., the effect of fragmentation per se) by comparing dECA and dA. We also estimated the resistance of the landscape matrix to species movement based on the degree of naturalness of the land-cover type, with more natural land-cover types being less resistant to movement. We calculated the differences between the median value of landscape resistance between 2050 and 2011 for each county to evaluate changes in matrix permeability (i.e., resistance to species movement) for scenario A1B and B2. This data set includes the difference between changes in connectivity (dECA) and changes in grassland cover (dA) for species with a median dispersal distance (MDD) of 1, 5, 10 and 25 km for scenario A1B and scenario B2.

One potential technique is the use of biochars (charcoal made from decomposition of organic matter at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen), which can be used as a soil amendment that can increase soil moisture retention, improve agricultural yields, and hold carbon in soil for long periods of time.

This data set contains soil water infiltration measurements using Beerkan infiltration rings in four Oregon agricultural soils amended with biochar. Gasified biochars made from wheat straw (AgEnergy, Spokane, WA) and conifer wood (BioLogical, Philomath, OR) were tilled into soils at experimental stations in Madras (loam), Pendleton (silt loam), Aurora (sandy loam), and Klamath Falls (loamy sand). The biochars were incorporated by tillage in fall 2016 to a depth of 12 cm at rates equating to 0, 9, 18, and 36 Mg/ha (about 0.5, 1, 2, and 4% by mass in the tillage zone), with three replicate plots per treatment. In April and May 2017 infiltration was measured by inserting small rings into the soil surface and determining the time required for repeated 10 0mL volumes of water to infiltrate. From each infiltration experiment we estimated steady-state infiltration rate, and where possible we also estimated field saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Kfs). Diagnostic plots demonstrated that in about half of the measurements sets, Kfs could be estimated by modeling infiltration as a two-term function of sorptivity and Kfs. In the remaining plots, additional unknown factors that influenced infiltration prevented estimation of Kfs, possibly due to air entrapment, soil layering, or ring insertion effects in the remaining experiments.

The American pronghorn, for example, is a game species that contributes to local and state economies. Climate extremes, including severe droughts, heat waves, and atmospheric river events, are expected to occur more frequently in the Southwest. These extremes can affect the availability of food and water needed by wildlife. Wildlife management agencies and conservation organizations need information on resource availability for wildlife under future climate scenarios to design effective management strategies to sustain wildlife populations.   Project scientists are working with the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and other partners to understand the effects of changing resource availability on four grassland species: American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), Gunnison\u2019s prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni), Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamat), and Gambel\u2019s Quail (Callipepla gambelii).   The project team will use historical climate data, satellite data on vegetation greenness, and field data on the locations and abundance of wildlife populations to explore the links among climate variables, food availability, and wildlife populations. The team then will use climate models to project how forage, and ultimately wildlife populations, are likely to respond to projected changes in climate.    This project will help inform landscape-level planning, establish conservation priorities, and suggest management approaches for adapting to shifting climate and resource availability for wildlife. For example, results of this research could be used by state wildlife agencies to guide management of grasslands for species of greatest conservation need or economically important game species, by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to establish high-priority locations within the National Wildlife Refuge System, and by conservation organizations to prioritize conservation easements and land purchases in grasslands likely to remain high-quality habitat for wildlife.", "proj_items": {}, "num_items": 0}, "59efa389e4b0220bbd999db4": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59efa389e4b0220bbd999db4", "proj_phrases": ["permafrost thaw", "earth \u2019", "boreal forest watershed", "boreal forest", "major role", "soil moisture", "understanding hydrology", "nome creek experimental watershed", "tracer experiments", "comparative hydrological", "ecosystem changes", "largest terrestrial biome", "\u2019 s", "ncew", "investigates tracers experiments", "soils investigations", "biogeochemical cycling", "earth", "aquatic biogeochemistry", "terrestrial biome", "multiple studies", "stream flow", "discontinuous permafrost"], "avg_item_sim": 0, "proj_summary": "The Nome Creek Experimental Watershed (NCEW) has been the site of multiple studies focused on understanding hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem changes related to permafrost thaw and fire in the boreal forest.

Aspen woodlands also provide high quality forage for livestock and draw tourists to the region to view the golden vistas that form in the fall.   However, aspen is currently declining across large portions of the West and it\u2019s estimated that approximately 40% of western aspen will be without suitable climate conditions within 50 years. In the northern and central Rocky Mountains, it\u2019s thought that reduced soil moisture and changing fire patterns in particular could affect the trees. Yet understanding the future of aspen in the region is currently challenged by a lack of information on how changes in fire and soil moisture interact to impact aspen growth, survival, and distribution. For example, in some places aspen may thrive following fire if soil moisture is adequate, while they may decline in areas where soil moisture is too low.  The goal of this work is to project the likely effects of altered moisture and fire regimes on aspen under climate change. Based on the results, researchers will develop maps of future aspen distribution in the northern and central Rocky Mountains and identify areas that could be suitable for aspen restoration. Additionally, researchers will project how climate change and aspen mortality might alter streamflow in watersheds that have large amounts of snow redistribution, in order to help small-scale irrigators adapt to future conditions. The results of this project will help land managers prioritize areas for aspen protection and restoration and proactively plan for the effects of climate change on this important species.

These data were used to calibrate the one-dimensional Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model. These data and the SHAW calibration have previously been described in multiple publications, particularly Chauvin et al 2011 and Flerchinger et al 2016. In the dataset presented here, climate scenarios have been constructed, applied to the historic record, simulated in the SHAW model, and hydrologic results have been analyzed. These data include the following: (1) uscData. These are the historical data described above, prepared for input into the SHAW model with three hydrologic response units (HRU), labeled \u201caspen\u201d, \u201chighsage\u201d, and \u201clowsage.\u201d (2) synthetic_data: These directories contain synthetic data representing climate scenarios, with corresponding names. Climate scenarios were constructed in the script, \u201cclimate_analyze.R.\u201d Climate scenarios input to this script were obtained from the Integrated Scenarios project: http://climate.nkn.uidaho.edu/IntegratedScenarios/. Historic (1950-2005) and future (2050-2099, RCP 8.5) climate projections were obtained for the grid cell containing Upper Sheep Creek. Seasonally variable daily mean changes in temperature and precipitation were derived by comparing historical and future data; these were stored as \u201cdelta functions\u201d (in delta.csv). For each seasonally variable scenario, the effective mean annual change in precipitation or temperature was calculated, and this was applied in the same amount for each day of the water year. The naming convention is as follows: txpydz, where \u201cx\u201d is the temperature deviation from the delta function identified by comparing historical data with 2050-2099 RCP8.5. \u201cy\u201d is the precipitation deviation from the original delta function. X or y values equal to NA indicate that the precipitation or temperature was not changed. \u201cz\u201d indicates whether the simulation is seasonally constant (z = 1) or variable (z = 0). An empirically-derived drift function was applied to each of these scenarios in order to determine effective precipitation after snow drifting (Chauvin et al 2011). (3) model_runs: This directory contains all the files necessary to run the SHAW model. For more information on the SHAW model inputs and outputs, see ShawUsers.30.docx, or ftp site: ftp://ftp.nwrc.ars.usda.gov/public/ShawModel/. In these scenarios, the .exe files named for each HRU contain the names of the .inp files. Providing these .exe files as an input to SHAW allows for SHAW to be run automatically from an R script. The script, \u201crun_shaw_windows.R\u201d contains the code needed to run SHAW. To use this code, we recommend reading the script and changing the directory paths at the beginning of it to suit your needs. This script takes several hours to run on a laptop computer, particularly for the aspen HRU (~10 minutes per scenario on MacbookPro 2015 with 2.7GHz Intel Core i5 and 8GB RAM running Windows in Parallels). (4) model_output: These folders contain the outputs of the SHAW model after runs with the scenarios as described above. Within each HRU directory, each folder is named for one scenario, and contains the output files corresponding to that scenario. The output files are named only after the type of file (e.g., water.out). For that reason, the directory structure provided here is critical to the interpretability of these data. This folder also contains a hydrologic response unit not included in \u201csynthetic_data.\u201d In the \u201cas\u201d folder, aspen HRU site characteristics, including weather, have been used, but aspen have been replaced with grasses to simulate the effects of aspen mortality. (5) Tabular_results: This folder contains .csv files that summarize the data contained in the model_output folder over different time periods and for different analysis objectives. Each of these .csv files is created within the workflow described in the R script, \u201crun_shaw.R\u201d. (6) R: This folder contains scripts used to run the analyses for this project. The script \u201crun_shaw.R\u201d is a heavily commented script that functions as a recipe for the entire analysis; going through the directions in run_shaw.R should enable you to reproduce the analysis in this project. These data were used to assess the hydrologic sensitivity of Upper Sheep Creek to changing climate and to aspen mortality. They could be used to reproduce our analysis, assess hydrologic impacts aside from those assessed in the scripts included here, or as a template for building more climate (or other) scenarios.",

In order for the state to adequately prepare for and adapt to changing conditions, high-resolution climate data is needed.   One solution for acquiring this data is to use dynamical downscaling, a technique in which higher resolution weather forecasting models are used to provide local context to global-scale data. As part of this project, researchers have applied dynamical downscaling to ERA-Interim global atmospheric data for the years 1979-2015, and to two future climate model projections derived from the CMIP5 RCP8.5 scenario for the years 1970-2100. These data provide hourly information at 20 km resolution for all of Alaska and feature more than 30 meteorological variables, including temperature, precipitation (rain vs. snow), winds, and humidity. Researchers have so far evaluated the accuracy of the downscaled ERA-Interim temperature and precipitation simulations by comparing the downscaled estimates to actual observed conditions.   The downscaled ERA-Interim data can be used by stakeholders to investigate climate- and weather-related phenomena in Alaska. Combining an improved understanding of these phenomena with projections of future climate conditions derived from the downscaled climate scenario data (1970-2100) can help stakeholders effectively plan for future climate conditions in Alaska.", "proj_items": {}, "num_items": 0}, "5274200be4b097f32ac3f2a5": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5274200be4b097f32ac3f2a5", "proj_phrases": ["grasping", "larger population level", "southwest", "\u2019 t", "hardy species", "u.s.", "american pronghorn", "region \u2019", "animal \u2019", "animal \u2019 s behavior", "rio grande", "species", "environmental changes", "rio grande cutthroat trout", "desert bighorn sheep", "management planning", "individual behavioral changes", "arid southwest", "drier conditions", "southwestern u.s.", "population level", "iconic species", "climate models project warmer", "often", "project examines", "cutthroat trout", "dry environments", "different ways", "reproductive rates", "region \u2019 s iconic species", "overall population changes"], "avg_item_sim": 0.6227, "proj_summary": "Species that inhabit the arid Southwest are adapted to living in hot, dry environments.

Grasping the impacts of drought on fish and wildlife will be critical for management planning in the Southwest, as climate models project warmer, drier conditions for the region in the future.   Species are known to respond to environmental changes such as drought in different ways. Often, before changes are observed at the larger population level, they are first noticed at the level of the individual, through changes in an animal\u2019s behavior. For example, when vegetation becomes harder to find during a drought, individuals may increase the amount of time and energy they spend searching for food. If changes in behavior such as these are not sufficient to compensate for the lack of vegetation, the population as a whole could eventually experience decreased survival and reproductive rates.   Through four sub-projects, researchers are working to improve our knowledge of individual behavioral changes (in the case of desert bighorn sheep) and overall population changes (for pronghorn, trout, and quail) that occur in response to drought.

As a continuation of our inaugural USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC) project, this study examined the effects of climate and land use change on bird populations and their riparian and wetland habitats in the western US. Scientists at the USGS, academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) examined the linkages between climate, hydrology, and the biological factors that influence riparian and wetland ecosystem resilience and migratory bird communities. To this end, we (1) collectively developed a synthesis document exploring the linkages between the myriad of elements determining climate change effects on bird communities and communicated this state-of-knowledge to wildlife managers; (2) downscaled data using statistical and dynamical approaches that produce ensemble climate models; (3) developed models to forecast climate effects on water and biological outcomes on wetlands in the northern Great Plains; (4) developed models that relate climate predictions to snowmelt timing, stream flow, water management, and the phenology and growth of native and invasive riparian plants, (5) predicted migrant bird responses to changes in phenology and habitats; and (6) examine the role of phenotypic plasticity in avian responses to climate change. By exploring the effects of altered climate and habitat conditions on riparian-dependent birds using a holistic approach that incorporates both top-down and bottom-up constraints, we can better predict changes in riparian ecosystems and responses of migratory birds to those changes. The results can assist managers and conservation professionals within federal, state, and NGOs who are concerned with protecting migratory bird species and managing riparian invasive species, by addressing all four science goals of the NCCWSC.

The goal of this project is to develop tools to support migratory bird management decision-making in the face of uncertain future climate and land use conditions. In order to identify and implement the most effective management strategies, decision-makers need to have both an understanding of the potential outcomes of different management actions and of how environmental conditions might change over time.   To address this need, researchers will (1) evaluate predictions of how changing climate conditions are expected to affect migratory birds and how these impacts could affect management decisions, and (2) work closely with managers to determine which areas of uncertainty could have the biggest impact on the success of decision-making. Researchers will then develop a decision-support framework for identifying optimal strategies for migratory bird management in the face of uncertain future climate and land use conditions. This work will focus on supporting key management decisions related to acquiring public lands for habitat, setting harvest regulations for waterfowl, and assessing allowable take of migratory birds.

Prescribed fire is commonly used in the western U.S. to remove potential wildfire fuel, such as small trees and shrubs. It is also thought that this act of selectively removing trees helps remaining trees better survive drought events, because there is less competition for water. However, this proposition has never been formally tested. This project aims to identify whether current prescribed burning practices are sufficient to help forests survive drought, or whether these practices need to be implemented more intensively to meet this goal under increasingly frequent drought.   This project will answer questions at the forefront of research needs across federal land management agencies in California. Results will (1) help National Park Service staff make planning decisions to preserve giant sequoias at Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks; (2) help fire managers at the parks identify the effectiveness of different fire treatments and whether prescribed burning should be implemented as a drought resistance strategy; and (3) inform strategic planning efforts of the U.S. Forest Service on where and how much to thin forest stands, as well as inform plans for restoring landscapes impacted by major wildfires.   Droughts are expected to become more frequent and severe in the coming decades across the Southwest. This project will enable managers to make cost-benefit analyses of dollars spent using prescribed fire and determine whether this method can be used to prepare forests for a warmer and drier future.

First, they can undergo adaptive evolutionary change. Second, they can adjust their phenotype via non-evolutionary pathways. Both of these factors could substantially change species climate change vulnerability rankings. In this proposal, we will draw from a wide range of existing data to incorporate the ability of species to adjust their phenotype to climate change into vulnerability assessments. We will do this through a series of models that relate the extent to which a species\u2019 physical environment will change to the number of individuals likely to remain. Our models will allow a detailed comparison of vulnerability to climate change with and without evolutionary adaptive change and will include some possible management actions that augment a species\u2019 capacity for this adaptive change.

This project had two broad objectives: The first was to meet the needs of the Yurok Tribe in collecting traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) to identify priority areas and activities for helping the Tribe plan for and respond to climate change. The second objective was to provide a culturally appropriate model for how tribes and non-tribal entities (including federal agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) could collect, document, and integrate TEK into decision making. TEK is often proprietary, culturally sensitive, and privileged information, even within a tribal community. Researchers sought to develop a process that would protect the confidentiality and intellectual property rights of community members to preserve the integrity of the information and wisdom involved and to reinforce the responsibility of those who possess and share it.   Researchers conducted structured interviews with elders from the Yurok Tribe and used ethnographic methods to analyze the results. From this analysis, several general themes emerged. For example, Yurok elders have a good understanding of how the environment has changed over the last 200 years. They identified numerous species, including salmon, sturgeon, elk, and porcupine, whose populations have undergone serious declines in the past century. In addition, elders were particularly concerned about observed changes in temperature, flow, and water quality of the Klamath River.

The model helps forecast how climate change will affect landscapes, habitats, and ecosystem services, providing useful information for natural resource managers seeking to prepare for and prioritize actions related to climate change.   The goal of this project was to support the development of the IEM through several critical phases, including model parameterization (defining rules and relationships), validation (checking how well the model represents what\u2019s happening in the real world), and verification (making sure the model was built according to upfront assumptions). Researchers conducted field studies to collect information on vegetation, soil carbon and nitrogen, climate, and permafrost in the Yukon River Basin and Tanana River floodplain, providing insight on how permafrost thaw will affect these and similar ecosystems.

There are two general approaches of downscaling: dynamical and statistical.

Many past studies have evaluated the performance of these two broad approaches of downscaling with respect to climate variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation), but few have translated these evaluations to ecological metrics that managers use to make decisions in planning for climate change. This study uses maple syrup production as a case study for evaluating how these two downscaling techniques perform in terms of projecting changes in the tapping season. Maple syrup producers are interested in how climate change will affect their industry. Our results will give them a sense of the range they can expect for different aspects of the tapping season (timing of tap date, length of season, quality of sap, etc.).

Currently, scientists and resource managers often find it difficult to use downscaled climate projections because of the multiple methodologies used to produce them and the time-consuming process required to obtain model output. In response, the research team implemented a three-part plan to provide high resolution climate data for the impact modeling community. First, a database was developed of up-to-date and state-of-the-art downscaled climate projections for the U.S., using a range of plausible future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Second, a series of workshops were held to solicit input about climate-related data needs and to discuss best practices for accessing and using downscaled climate projections. Finally, downscaled projections were made available as an enterprise-level web-based source. Users are able to freely access the data via an interactive, easily manageable interface, in formats which are familiar to ecosystem and impact modelers. The climate dataset was generated by applying advanced statistical downscaling methods to a comprehensive selection of global climate model simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment (IPCC AR4) database, with the capability of rapidly updating results as new climate model output becomes available. The workshops involved key stakeholders from the USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC) modeling community and decision-makers and managers from the USGS and our partnering Department of the Interior agencies, such as the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service. This project: (1) allows for consistent impact assessments at the scale of the most critical ecosystem processes through downscaling projections of daily temperature and precipitation across the continental U.S.; (2) enables scientists and managers to easily access, manipulate and download data relevant to modeling climate change impacts on ecosystems through a common web-based data portal; and (3) explores ways to reduce redundant efforts to obtain and produce downscaled climate projections by soliciting feedback from the NCCWSC research community. Most importantly, this work enables impact assessments to be based on the same common data set, allowing researchers and resource managers to compare results and projections across regions and ecosystems.

This has prompted varied research efforts to determine the factors contributing to the reduced local populations. Although heat stress from increasing temperatures could be a potential factor for declining populations in Minnesota, temperature increases have also occurred in New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut where populations have been expanding in recent years. Alternatively, indirect climate effects from warmer temperatures may be playing a role, such as increased prevalence of parasites (e.g., brainworm, winter tick) to levels lethal to moose. Additionally, factors such as predation, differences in habitat, and fitness are being considered. Genomics has the potential to complement ongoing research by providing unique approaches to explore moose responses to stress through the examination of molecular differences in heat tolerance, immune response, or fitness in general. This project is utilizing such genomic techniques to study the responses of moose to environmental stressors throughout the southern periphery of their range in the U.S. Northeast, Midwest (Minnesota and Michigan), and Rocky Mountains. Because populations from those regions represent three subspecies, it is important to first understand population relatedness and any genetic variances through a genome scan. Secondarily, we will investigate actively expressed genes and cellular function, which may provide information on variation in immune responses to local stressors. Ultimately, we will look for genes that may be under selection, which could represent local adaptations to environmental conditions. This information has the potential to provide insights on moose fitness in a changing environment and aims to provide valuable information for managers in regions that are interested in maintaining sustainable populations.

Wildfire danger modeling is an important tool for understanding when and where wildfires will occur, and recent work by our team in the South Central United States has shown wildfire danger models may be improved by incorporating soil moisture information. Advancements in wildfire danger modeling may increase wildfire preparedness, and therefore decrease loss of life, property, and habitat due to wildfire. Still, soil moisture\u2014an important determinant of wildfire risk\u2014is not currently used for wildfire danger assessments because data are generally unavailable at the appropriate scales of space and time.  Our project addresses this knowledge gap by developing and disseminating improved wildfire danger assessments that are rooted in high precision estimates of soil moisture. Primary goals are (1) develop an effective model of soil moisture for the Red River and Rio Grande basins using soil maps and climate data; (2) quantify the relationships between modeled soil moisture and wildfire probability; and (3) distribute soil moisture and wildfire probability maps for both basins. Primary outcomes of this work include new web-based tools for exploring soil moisture dynamics in near real-time and relating those dynamics to wildfire probability. We will initiate an aggressive outreach program to ensure our results will have practical applications relevant to a wide range of stakeholders interested in drought, flooding, and fire monitoring and prediction. The intended users of research outcomes include hydrologists, soil scientists, fire planners, land management personnel from universities, state and federal agencies and stakeholder groups including landscape conservation cooperatives and Tribal organizations.

Many federal, state and local agencies use stream insects to monitor the health of freshwater ecosystems. While the temperature ranges for some insects are often inferred from the temperature of the waters where they were collected, this inference is coarse at best and problematic at worst. Stream temperatures fluctuate a lot during the year and temperature may or may not control where an insect lives. Field insects were collected and sent to a laboratory for testing several temperature endpoints, particularly at higher temperatures. Respiration, breathing rate, and some physical activities were expected to increase, as the insects attempt to deal with elevated temperatures and expected oxygen limitations. Previous research found that oxygen limitation results in the build-up of lactic and uric acids in tissues of insects, but this was not observed over the range of temperatures and types of insects tested for this study. While respiration, breathing rate and, physical behavior such as pumping motions were observed, it did not appear that elevated temperature alone was resulting in oxygen limitation. This was further confirmed with more experiments that looked specifically at low oxygen waters at various temperatures and included an evaluation of the insect\u2019s metabolic waste products; these warm temperature challenges did not suggest an oxygen deficit in these insects. Rather, the experiments suggested a more general elevated metabolic demand where the insects had to work harder to breath, eat, and molt. Further work to try and identify specific macroinvertebrate temperature tolerance values could be used by scientists and resource managers to predict aquatic resources at greatest risk to temperature change.

with high levels of uncertainty removed in post-processing. To estimate native and invasive species abundance in baseline climate conditions, a map was generated that considered abundance as percent cover and used high coefficient of variation values as a mask. The primary sources for post-processing the uncertainty masks are the Hawaiian Islands plant species abundance modeled means and standard deviation values (Wong et al., in preparation). These maps cover the entire landscape (including urban and agricultural areas), and therefore they can be applied in a variety of ways. Maps can be utilized to evaluate baseline climate conditions for each species and to forecast changes to community structure through expected shifts in species abundance. Maps can be combined in order to predict community dominance, for example, by identifying the most abundant native species at a given location. This can be applied to: 1) spatial and temporal assessments of habitat quality and community structure comparisons; 2) defining specific ecological restoration objectives; and 3) identifying potential for key invasive species to threaten a site (even where they are presently not found). Future projected abundances can enhance conservation planning both by anticipating where native species may increase or decrease in abundance and by identifying areas where invasive species may extend their range. Combining this with assessments of relative response rates can aid managers in prioritizing native species to promote and invasive species to preemptively control at a given site. Purpose: These data were compiled to provide context from other data products (e.g., correlative species abundance model maps, standard deviation value maps, habitat quality maps, and species relative response characteristics) such that areas with high uncertainty were identified and removed from species abundance model maps developed by Wong et al. (in preparation). These post-processed maps contribute to an initial set of supporting tools for managers and decision makers. However, given the inconsistency of their statistical performance between evaluation metrics, some of these exploratory abundance maps should be used with caution and with reference to high levels of uncertainty. As is the case with other macro-scale correlative models, they should be applied to management at a conceptual, landscape scale rather than for detailed management at local sites.", "avg_sim": 0.6156,

Native American tribes have collected and boiled down sap for centuries, and the tapping of maple trees is a cultural touchstone for many people in the Northeast and Midwest.   Overall demand for maple syrup has been rapidly rising as more people appreciate this natural sweetener. Yet because the tapping season is dependent on weather conditions, there is concern about the sustainability of maple sugaring as the region\u2019s climate changes. The distribution of sugar maple could move north into Canada and the sap flow season may become shorter in the future.

Results from this analysis, described in the final report below, will enable researchers to identify areas that are likely to be more or less viable for maple sugaring in the future.

The outlooks developed by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service are currently used by stakeholders to make critical water allocation decisions in the basin. Improvements to water supply outlooks could be worth millions of dollars associated with better water allocation strategies.   In order to ensure that these outlooks are as accurate as possible for water management planning, there is a need to better understand how snowpack and snowmelt runoff are related to each other and how both may be influenced by large climatic variation such as El Ni\u00f1o and global climate change. To address this need, this project will combine historical data and climate model projections to develop enhanced prediction models relating winter snowpack to subsequent snowmelt runoff in the upper Rio Grande.   The results of this research will identify changes to streamflow predictability over the past several decades (a period of rapid observed warming), and assess future predictability. This work will also help to inform the development of more reliable water supply outlooks essential for planning purposes in the Rio Grande Basin, such as reservoir management and irrigated agriculture.

Since there are many different approaches to downscaling there associated sources of uncertainty; however, downscaled data can be highly valuable for management decision-making if used with a knowledge of its limitations and appropriate applications.

This project will produce 243 climate projections using three different downscaling methods, giving researchers insight into how each of these methods responds to various sources of climate uncertainty. This analysis will allow researchers to assist managers in selecting the best downscaled data for their specific management questions.

Because species interact, shifts in one species\u2019 phenology can have cascading effects throughout entire food webs and ecosystems. Recent advances have helped grow the body of literature surrounding phenology. We now know, for example, that invasive species often show greater flexibility in the timing of their phenological events, enabling them to outcompete native species as climate and environmental conditions change.  Natural resource managers recognize that changes in phenology can substantially affect their management activities. Phenological information can be used to identify when to survey for or treat invasive insects or plants, when to apply prescribed fire to maintain habitat, or when to prepare for peak tourist seasons in national parks. However, managers on-the-ground are often uncertain about how to best incorporate this information into their management practices.  With a focus on the Southwest U.S., this project will connect scientists and natural resource managers to ensure that managers are getting the right phenological information, in the right format, at the right time. Through a series of workshops, scientists with the USA National Phenology Network, the USGS, and universities will connect with resource managers from federal and state land management agencies, tribes, and private landholders to identify key decisions that would immediately benefit from phenological information. Through this engagement process, targeted products will be developed to address stakeholder-identified needs. Such products might include maps projecting green up of invasive plant species, such as buffelgrass, to inform the timing of the application of control treatments.

Their survival and reproduction is dependent on sufficient winter habitat and food sources, which may be threatened by climate change.  During the winter, caribou eat lichens (organisms made up of algae and fungus) that grow on the snow-covered ground. Lichens will likely have a complex response to climate change, affected in different ways by factors like changing precipitation, wildfire, and competition with plants. For example, as temperatures warm, there will likely be less snow cover, exposing more of the lichen to caribou. Simultaneously, increased fire frequency could reduce lichen availability.  Moose, on the other hand, eat the twigs of deciduous shrubs that stick up above the snow. Unlike lichen, shrub habitats may actually be affected positively by increased fire. Warmer temperatures and less snow are also likely to increase shrub biomass.  Project researchers are using the Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Model to unravel some of these complex relationships and estimate the effects of climate change on food availability for these two species throughout most of Alaska and parts of Canada (from about 1970-2100). The resulting maps will be divided by land ownership and landscape characteristics to show expected changes in winter food for moose and caribou that will be tailored to and directly useable by natural resource managers as they devise strategies for adapting to a changing climate.

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes.

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes. The percentage of lakes with abundant largemouth bass and failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 59% in contemporary conditions to 86% of lakes by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the number of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 8.5% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 38 1% of lakes in both future periods.

We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes. The percentage of lakes with abundant largemouth bass and failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 59% in contemporary conditions to 86% of lakes by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the number of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 8.5% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 38 1% of lakes in both future periods. Importantly, we identify nearly 100 resilient lakes predicted to continue to support walleye recruitment. Management resources could target preserving these resilient walleye populations.

To help close these existing information gaps, this project aims to develop and conduct the next generation of scientific assessments that will improve the ability of natural resource managers to use critical scientific information for climate adaptation. The main focal areas of the project include providing 1) recommendations for best practices for integrating science into natural resource management, 2) the information needed to allow managers to prepare in advance for extreme events, and 3) enhanced opportunities for knowledge exchange between scientists and managers. The Southwest CASC is partnering with the Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions at the University of Arizona to organize a working group of scientists and resource managers that will design and implement a regional adaptation and science assessment network. Once established, this network will work to synthesize existing knowledge and evaluate information needs on priority management topics.

This will serve as an important step toward developing a transferable process to help parks ensure that grazing management practices are responsive and adaptive to future climate change.   In the first phase of the project, the team will engage resource managers from three NPS units in western Colorado: Dinosaur National Monument (DINO), Curecanti National Recreation Area (CURE), and Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park (BLCA). Working with resource managers and subject-matter experts, the team will articulate and describe the planning processes and available information with regard to NPS grazing management. The team will then convene researchers, managers, subject-matter experts, and climate change adaptation specialists at a participatory climate change scenario planning workshop to develop a small set (3-5) of challenging, plausible, relevant, and divergent future scenarios that qualitatively assess how grazing resources and management at DINO may be affected under climate change. Concurrently, the process will identify common key characteristics that may be regionally applicable to BLCA and CURE, and will consider caveats for broader use at parks managing grazing in other regional biomes. Workshop participants will provide input on the project and process, identify quantitative information needs, and offer recommendations for streamlining the effort into a scalable, transferable approach that could be used to guide other park units seeking to update their own grazing management plans.    A potential second phase of this project would entail the development of a modeling approach to provide quantitative information to NPS units that allow livestock grazing.

Meanwhile, the ecological impacts of drought in the region have included increased tree mortality, surges in the outbreak of pests, and intensifying forest fires.   Located within this region is the Missouri River Basin, an important agricultural production area home to approximately 12 million people, including 28 Native American tribes.

This information will enable researchers to determine the types of climate data and tools that will help managers operating under drought conditions. Locally-specific \u201cdrought stories\u201d will be developed, detailing historic trends and future projections of drought, as well as the risk perceptions, decisions, and adaptive capacities of local managers.

Also downloaded at the same time were grids that described the estimated reliability of NDVI observations and the actual day of the year for each NDVI observation used in maximum compositing routines by the MODIS program. All MODIS data layers were reprojected to match meadow data layers.All negative NDVI values which are thought to correspond to standing water, partial snow-cover or wet bare soil were set to \u2018NA\u2019values (Huete, Justice and van Leeuwen 1999)The following steps were used to remove any conifer/evergreen signal from NDVI data and are based on an understanding that each pixel has a different \u201cbackground\u201d(i.e. no-growth) greenness against which any seasonal change must be compared (Beever et al. 2013; Piekielek and Hansen 2013). These methods also help to eliminate long gaps in data that can allow smoothing algorithms to interpolate beyond the valid range of data (in the case of NDVI from 0 \u20131):Annual minimum NDVI values that were labeled as high-quality were identified in the 13 year time-series.The bottom first percentileof a distribution of minimum values was used as the \u201cbackground\u201dvalue to fill-in missing values when the target was identified as being under snow cover.All NDVI values identified by pixel-reliability grids as being of high or marginal quality werepreserved and snow-covered pixels and dates were filled in with each pixels \u201cbackground\u201dvalue.Composite day of year grids were used to identify the actual date from which the 16-day maximum composite NDVI value came.Each pixel\u2019s entire time-series (2000 \u20132012) was smoothed in a weighted regression framework against time using smoothing splines (Chambers and Hastie 1992). NDVI data of marginal quality and snow-covered background values contributed half the weight to final smoothed values as did high-quality values. The final smoothed values were used to interpolate the time-series to a daily time-step and to record annual NDVI amplitudes. Land surface phenology metrics were calculated as follows:Start of season (SOS) \u2013the first annual day of year when smoothed NDVI crosses half of its annual amplitude (White et al. 2009).End of Season (EOS) \u2013the last day of year when smoothed NDVI crosses half of its annual amplitude.Maximum annual NDVI (MAX) \u2013the highest annual smoothed NDVITiming of annual maximum (DOYMAX) \u2013the smoothed day of year when NDVI reaches its maximum valueEstimated annual productivity (INDVI) \u2013the integrated area under the growing season (SOS to EOS) NDVI curve (Goward et al 1985).

National parks, including four in the Great Plains, provide a major last bastion for wild bison. Herds in Badlands National Park and Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in Kansas, and Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota are wild in that their movements are unconstrained within their park\u2019s designated bison range, they receive no supplemental feed, minerals, or veterinary attention, and social interactions are not constrained.   To maintain natural ecosystem conditions for wild bison within these parks, park managers regularly make decisions that affect bison herds, the animal communities they interact with, and the plant communities that support them. Until now, these decisions have focused on individual parks\u2019 bison herds. The National Park Service has set forth a new initiative that strives to increase managers\u2019 consideration of a broader range of issues when making bison management decisions in order to achieve region-wide objectives. This initiative will culminate in the National Park Service Midwest Region Strategic Bison Management Plan.   As part of this effort, the initiative\u2019s leadership team identified the need for a tool that evaluates the feasibility of maintaining desired bison health and ecosystem conditions in parks with bison herds under a range of potential management and climate scenarios, and that assesses how short-term management decisions could impact long-term objectives. To address this need, researchers will bring together NPS managers, biologists, and decision-makers, together with USGS and university scientists, to develop specific objectives for the bison management plan and to develop a detailed implementation plan for the production of such a tool. Close manager-scientist collaboration from the onset of the project will ensure a shared understanding of the tool\u2019s function and capabilities.

Changes in climate can impact streamflow through reduced snowpack and snowfall, earlier spring runoff, increased winter flow and flooding, and decreased summer flow.

Understanding how streamflow might change is instrumental not only for predicting changes in plant distribution and soil moisture, but also for infrastructure planning. Culvert replacement, bridge design, hydropower development, water reservoir placement, and floodplain restoration planning all require information on future trends in streamflow. Projections of peak flow, or the maximum flow of a stream, are particularly important for culvert and bridge engineering. Projections of low flow are more important for hydropower and fish habitat restoration planning.   The goal of this project is to improve projections of peak and low streamflow for small, ungaged watersheds in Southeast Alaska. Currently, most long-term stream gages are placed on larger rivers, meaning predictions for smaller streams are less accurate. Researchers are working closely with partners, including the Alaska Department of Transportation and Facilities and the National Weather Service, to identify specific needs and test methods for accurately modeling streamflow across Southeast Alaska\u2019s watersheds.

Researchers examined how glacial melting is altering the amount and timing of freshwater that enters the Gulf of Alaska from the Copper River. They also investigated the source and amount of two nutrients, iron and nitrate, dissolved in the water. As a complementary piece of the study, researchers tested the relationship between nutrient levels, plankton populations, and the populations of fish that feed on plankton.  Results show that substantial quantities of nutrients (e.g., up to hundreds of tons of iron) from glacial sediment are being added to the Copper River environment each year. Climate change, through accelerated glacial melting, may increase the quantity of nutrient additions to coastal ecosystems. Such changes would likely produce ecosystem changes \u2013 as high nutrient levels correspond with increased vegetation \u2013 but it is unknown what the exact changes would look like.

One strategy for preparing for the effects of sea-level rise is to ensure that there is space available for coastal wetlands to adapt by migration. In a recent study, researchers identified areas where coastal wetlands may move inland along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, one of the most wetland-rich and sea-level rise sensitive regions of the world. Building on these findings, this project will produce customized landscape conservation-design products focused on identifying landward migration routes for coastal wetlands.

However, due to differences in topography and coastal urbanization extent, estuaries vary in their ability to accommodate wetland migration. The landward movement of wetlands requires suitable conditions, such as a gradual slope and land free of urban development. Urban barriers can constrain migration and result in wetland loss (coastal squeeze). For future-focused conservation planning purposes, there is a pressing need to quantify and compare the potential for wetland landward movement and coastal squeeze. For 41 estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico (i.e., the USA gulf coast), we quantified and compared the area available for the landward migration of tidal saline wetlands and the area where urban development is expected to prevent migration (coastal squeeze), under three alternative future sea-level rise scenarios (0.5-, 1.0-, and 1.5-m by 2100). This effort builds on work by Enwright and others (2015, 2016) which modeled future tidal saline wetland landward migration at the region scale (i.e., all five Gulf coast states). However, there is much potential to use these data for customized analyses focused on landscape conservation design within specific estuaries. The objective of this analysis was to identify differences across estuaries in future landward tidal saline wetland migration opportunities and urban barriers to migration. In broad terms, we provide scientific information that could be used by natural resource managers to enhance the adaptive capacity of coastal wetlands in the face of sea-level rise and coastal development.

As part of this project, researchers identified important thresholds for ecosystem changes and highlighted coastal areas in the southeastern U.S. (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, and parts of Florida) where relatively small changes in winter conditions could cause relatively dramatic changes in coastal wetlands. Results indicate that mangrove forest expansion will bring about both above- and below-ground ecosystem changes. The most striking and apparent changes will occur above ground as forests develop and replace grasslands. These above-ground transformations will increase carbon storage and affect certain societal benefits provided by coastal wetlands in the region. The below-ground changes due to mangrove expansion will be more subtle and dependent upon the marsh that is being replaced. The below-ground impacts will be greatest along dry coasts (Texas), where mangrove expansion is expected to result in greater peat development and soil carbon storage.

southeastern U.S. Warmer winter temperatures and reductions in the intensity of freeze events would likely lead to mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement in parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

southeastern U.S. Warmer winter temperatures and reductions in the intensity of freeze events would likely lead to mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement in parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

southeastern U.S. Warmer winter temperatures and reductions in the intensity of freeze events would likely lead to mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement in parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

potential effect of winter climate change upon salt marsh and mangrove forest foundation species in the southeastern United States. Our research addresses the following three questions: (1) What is the relationship between winter climate and the presence and abundance of mangrove forests relative to salt marshes; (2) How vulnerable are salt marshes to winter climate change-induced mangrove forest range expansion; and (3) What is the potential future distribution and relative abundance of mangrove forests under alternative winter climate change scenarios? We developed simple winter climate-based models to predict mangrove forest distribution and relative abundance using observed winter temperature data (1970\u20132000) and mangrove forest and salt marsh habitat data. Our results identify winter climate thresholds for salt marsh\u2013mangrove forest interactions and highlight coastal areas in the southeastern United States (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, and parts of Florida) where relatively small changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme winter events could cause relatively dramatic landscape-scale ecosystem structural and functional change in the form of poleward mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The ecological implications of these marsh-to-mangrove forest conversions are poorly understood, but would likely include changes for associated fish and wildlife populations and for the supply of some ecosystem goods and services. In this study, we investigated the potential for winter climate change-induced mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement in the southeastern United States via a 30-year observed climate

The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions.

In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength?", "avg_sim": 0.6623, "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/545cfa50e4b0ba8303f711e2", "weighted_sim": 0.6558, "item_phrases": ["ecological implications",

change has the potential to have a large impact on coastal wetlands in the southeastern U.S. Warmer winter temperatures and reductions in the intensity of freeze events would likely lead to mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement in parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services. This file includes the site-level large plot vegetation cover data. This work was conducted via a collaborative effort between scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey National Wetland Research Center and the Department of Biology of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

As conflicts over the use of water resources grow in intensity, this information will become important for fish and wildlife managers to anticipate impacts of climate change on trust resources and to evaluate their management options. This project had four objectives: (1) to assemble an electronic database of observed historical water temperatures and other relevant water quality information for selected reservoirs in Texas with significant fisheries resource status; (2) to combine historical records of reservoir water quality, air temperature, and precipitation with projected climate changes to develop statistical models capable of projecting the potential impacts of future climate change on patterns of water temperature and quality in the selected reservoirs; (3) to assess the impact of the projected changes on the physical and chemical environment and on aquatic populations and communities; and (4) to conduct a retrospective analysis of relations that may exist between historical changes in water quality and the relatively recent spread of a harmful invasive species in Texas, golden alga.

These relationships are being disrupted by changing climate conditions. Most scientific information about changes in forests and other ecosystems have not been directed toward addressing the concerns of tribal communities. For example, they lack culturally-specific information pertaining to tribal knowledge systems, cultural practices, livelihoods, food and water security, and economies. Furthermore, ensuring that research is conducted in ways that are relevant to tribes is difficult when those who produce these studies lack experience in working with tribes, and are unfamiliar with tribal cultures.   Given the unique long-term cultural dependency of tribes on forests, there is a need to identify how existing climate science can be made more applicable to tribes, how tribal interests and values can be better incorporated and addressed, and how to better engage with tribes to plan and implement adaptation approaches that respect their knowledge systems and cultural practices. This project will focus on identifying the ways in which tribes in the Pacific Northwest rely on forest ecosystems and related resources for their well-being and cultural identity, with the goal of providing an integrated view of tribal vulnerability to climate change effects on forests. The research team will synthesize information from existing tribal, agency, organization, academic, and other plans and studies within the region regarding the vulnerability of tribal values to climate impacts and how to mitigate such impacts through holistic, restorative approaches.   The results of this project will highlight best practices for incorporating tribal interests and values in climate vulnerability assessments, adaptation planning, and implementation projects. This information will be a valuable resource for tribes who seek to increase co-management opportunities across their ancestral territories, and for tribal, federal, and non-governmental land managers to have more successful relationships with tribes and tribal communities.", "proj_items": {}, "num_items": 0}, "54247fb5e4b037b608f9edd9": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/54247fb5e4b037b608f9edd9", "proj_phrases": ["surface water balance", "relevant climate datasets", "potential impacts", "climate conditions", "u.s.", "supports foundational research", "foundational research", "foundational science area team", "north central u.s.", "soil moisture", "project aims", "social stress", "technical assistance", "influence drought", "\u201c scenarios \u201d", "plausible future climate conditions", "dominant driver", "evaporative demand", "modeling ecosystem response", "team", "north central region", "researchers", "21st century", "future climate conditions", "north central climate science center \u2019", "ecosystem response", "future droughts", "other nc csc projects", "climate", "different future climate scenarios", "foundational", "relevant climate datasets available", "science area", "address climate science challenges", "address climate science", "nc csc", "science center \u2019 s", "drought", "land managers", "high temperatures", "project team"], "avg_item_sim": 0.5944, "proj_summary": "In the North Central U.S., drought is a dominant driver of ecological, economic, and social stress.

However, this data requires extensive quality control and homogenization due to documented and undocumented station moves and other factors including human errors in recording or digitization. Station-based Pan Evaporation measurements (in mm) from 247 stations across the continental United States were compiled and quality controlled for the analysis shown in Dewes et al., 2017. This dataset reports warm season (May-October; for 21 stations the data is only available for May-September) pan evaporation with at least 20 years of data between 1950 and 2001. Both monthly values and long-term monthly averages are made available, including the climatological measure for standard deviation and coefficient of variation. Dewes et al. (2017) used this dataset to evaluate the ability of different E0 formulations \u2013 Hargreaves-Samani, Priestly-Taylor, and Penman-Monteith \u2013 to reproduce the spatial patterns of observed warm-season E0 and its interannual variability. This data is an extension of the dataset described in Hobbins (2004) and Hobbins et al. (2004) with 21 additional stations north of 41oN latitude. The extension was needed in order to include data in the North Central Climate Science Center region. For these added stations, the procedure described in Hobbins (2004) for quality control was applied, including an adjustment in the mean when documented station moves occurred, and the removal of obvious outliers. The quality control procedure for the extended dataset did not automate tests for undocumented inhomogeneities for these stations. For all stations, a visual inspection of the timeseries was used to add additional breakpoints in the data for homogenization (only two were added in the extended set), and to eliminate two stations from consideration. The pan evaporation dataset compiled from 247 stations across the continental United Stated (CONUS) provides an independent measure of the \"observed\" atmospheric evaporative demand (E0) for a period between 1950 and 2001. It is therefore unique in that capacity because almost all other estimations of E0 are mathematically derived using basic meteorological variables.

However, under certain conditions, such as locations on ridges with high wind speeds and sunny south-facing slopes, the snow that accumulated in the forest is likely to melt more slowly and disappear later. Our research analyzed forest effects on snow in the mountains across the diverse climate gradients in the Pacific Northwest, where we made careful observations at field sites and additionally incorporated citizen science. Working with regional forest and water managers, we developed a decision tree model to help managers to act strategically to maximize snow retention (protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others), providing more water later in the season for hydropower, agriculture, and fish flows. agriculture, and fish flows.", "proj_items": {"56eb39b5e4b0f59b85d91b51": {"item_summary": "UW_Olallie_photo_metadata &amp; image files:  These are the raw timelapse photographs.

UI_Mica_met:  Metadata and associated snow depth and SWE observations from 14 manual snow courses taken in the Mica Creek Experimental Watershed, as part of a University of Idaho project (PI: Tim Link). Snow courses were performed during in WY 2006, approximately monthly from February to March, and approximately bi-weekly from March to May.  Snow course transects were 20 m long, with snow depth measurements taken approximately every 2m, and SWE approximately every 4m with a Federal Snow Sampler.  Transects were located in different forest harvest treatment sections, applied to the watershed in around 2001, including clear-cut harvest, partial harvest, and control sections (both second growth and old growth control forests).  Note that the partial cut canopy also includes skid trails, and some of the snow courses traverse the skid trails which tend to act more like canopy gaps than partial canopy (see Du et al 2013, Hydrological Processes, for discussion of this). Location attributes such as elevation, slope, and aspect, for snow courses taken from Jason Hubbart's personal files, Hubbart_snow_course.xls, with his permission; note that these values may differ from those extracted from a digital elevation model based on the coordinates of the transect.  Coordinates represent the middle of the 20 m snow course, and transects were completed parallel to slope.

Location attributes, such as elevation, slope, and aspect, for snow courses taken from Jason Hubbart's personal files, Hubbart_snow_course.xls, with his permission; note that these values may differ from those extracted from a digital elevation model based on the coordinates of the transect.  Snow course coordinates represent the middle of the 20 m snow course, and transects were completed parallel to slope. Climate change is projected to cause earlier snowmelt, with potentially serious consequences for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and for municipal and agricultural water supplies. However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management. Results from this project will help managers to act strategically to maximize snow retention (protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others), providing more water later in the season

meteorological data were collected at seven locations across the Lawler Landing site (elevation 880 m) from February to May of WY 2008.  A 70 m north-south oriented transect of 5 snow depth sensors was deployed to record sub-daily snow depth, with co-located meteorological instruments. The sensors traversed a 40 m long elliptical forest gap and the adjacent forest in both directions. The locations were the same as those used previously to quantify how shortwave and longwave radiation vary across a forest gap [Lawler and Link, 2011]. Two additional snow depth sensors and meteorological stations were deployed at \u201cinterior forest reference\u201d and \u201copen reference\u201d sites, situated 80 m southeast and 1200 m west, respectively, from the main transect. Whereas the forest reference site was similar to the surrounding forest, the open reference site was much more exposed than the forest gap.  These data are generally raw datalogger output and have not been quality controlled in any way unless specifically designated in the variable name.

observations were collected over WY 2012-2014 from four paired forest-open sites chosen to span a broad elevation range. Study sites were located in the upper McKenzie (McK) River watershed, approximately 100 km east of Corvallis, Oregon, on the western slope of the Cascade Range and in the Middle Fork Willamette (MFW) watershed, located to the south of the McKenzie.  The sites were designated based on elevation, with a range of 1110-1480 m.  Distributed snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) observations were collected via monthly manual snow courses from 1 November through 1 April and bi-weekly thereafter. Snow courses spanned 500 m of forested terrain and 500 m of adjacent open terrain.  Snow depth observations were collected approximately every 10 m and SWE was measured every 100 m along the snow courses with a federal snow sampler.  These data are raw observations and have not been quality controlled in any way.  Distance along the transect was estimated in the field.    OSU_SnowDepth Summary: 10-minute snow depth observations collected at OSU met stations in the upper McKenzie River Watershed and the Middle Fork Willamette Watershed during Water Years 2012-2014.  Each meterological tower was deployed to represent either a forested or an open area at a particular site, and generally the locations were paired, with a meterological station deployed in the forest and in the open area at a single site.  These data were collected in conjunction with manual snow course observations, and the meterological stations were located in the approximate center of each forest or open snow course transect.  These data have undergone basic quality control.  See manufacturer specifications for individual instruments to determine sensor accuracy.  This file was compiled from individual raw data files (named \"RawData.txt\" within each site and year directory) provided by OSU, along with metadata of site attributes.  We converted the Excel-based timestamp (seconds since origin) to a date, changed the NaN flags for missing data to NA, and added site attributes such as site name and cover.  We replaced positive values with NA, since snow depth values in raw data are negative (i.e., flipped, with some correction to use the height of the sensor as zero).  Thus, positive snow depth values in the raw data equal negative snow depth values.  Second, the sign of the data was switched to make them positive. Then, the smooth.m (MATLAB) function was used to roughly smooth the data, with a moving window of 50 points.  Third, outliers were removed.  All values higher than the smoothed values +10, were replaced with NA. In some cases, further single point outliers were removed.    OSU_Met Summary: Raw, 10-minute meteorological observations collected at OSU met stations in the upper McKenzie River Watershed and the Middle Fork Willamette Watershed during Water Years 2012-2014.  Each meterological tower was deployed to represent either a forested or an open area at a particular site, and generally the locations were paired, with a meterological station deployed in the forest and in the open area at a single site.  These data were collected in conjunction with manual snow course observations, and the meteorological stations were located in the approximate center of each forest or open snow course transect. These stations were deployed to collect numerous meteorological variables, of which snow depth and wind speed are included here.  These data are raw datalogger output and have not been quality controlled in any way.  See manufacturer specifications for individual instruments to determine sensor accuracy.  This file was compiled from individual raw data files (named \"RawData.txt\" within each site and year directory) provided by OSU, along with metadata of site attributes.

However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management. Results from this project will help managers to act strategically to maximize snow retention (protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others), providing more water later in the season for hydropower, agriculture, and fish flows.", "avg_sim": 0.6241, "item_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/56e9baf0e4b0f59b85d81a0a", "weighted_sim": 0.6175, "item_phrases": ["wgs1984",

wintering waterfowl. However, the potential effects of sea-level rise is posing new questions about the future availability of SAV for waterfowl and other coastal wildlife. Of primary concern is the fact that rising seas have the potential to increase salinities in fresh and brackish marshes on the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s coast, changing the distribution and composition of SAV communities, and affecting valuable waterfowl habitat and food resources. Not enough is known about the relationship between salinity and SAV to predict how this important food resource will respond to higher salinity levels, creating difficulties for waterfowl conservation planning.   This project identified the relationship between SAV, salinity, and other environmental variables as a first step in understanding how sea-level rise might affect food availability for waterfowl. The study examined coastal marshes of the northern Gulf of Mexico from Mobile Bay, AL, to the Nueces River, TX. Researchers compared SAV distribution and composition across a range of salinity levels, and found that water depth and salinity were the primary factors in determining the amount of SAV resources in a particular marsh. Surprisingly, researchers also found that brackish marsh tended to produce quantities of SAV waterfowl food resources similar to those in fresh marsh environments. The study also found some evidence that saline marshes contain less waterfowl food resources than brackish, intermediate, and fresh marshes.   This work will directly benefit efforts of the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, Gulf Coast Prairies Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC), and Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCC in forecasting the effects of sea-level rise on the distribution, abundance, and diversity of SAV resources and the priority fish and wildlife populations that depend upon them.

Many species are moving in directions and at rates that correspond with recent climatic change. Understanding how species distributions and abundances are likely to be altered can inform management and planning activities resulting in more robust management. We projected climate-driven changes in the abundances and distributions of 31 focal bird species in Oregon and Washington using the latest downscaled CMIP5 climate projections and corresponding vegetation model outputs. We mapped these future projections and integrated them into an existing web-based tool (http://data.pointblue.org/apps/nwcsc/) to allow managers and planners to access and download the projections. Our model outputs forecast significant changes in vegetation across much of Washington and Oregon by the end of the century. These changes are particularly dramatic east of the Cascade Mountains. Our bird models project much less dramatic changes in avian communities across the two states, but those changes tend to be largest in the Olympic and Cascade Mountains as well as across portions of the Columbia Plateau and in eastern and southeastern Oregon. Despite the smaller changes in avian communities, our models do project significant changes in abundance for some species in specific locations ranging from large increases to local extirpations. Our results also show that for some bird species, vegetation model projections are particularly important for forecasting changes in abundances and distributions. For example, Columbia Plateau Low Sagebrush Steppe and Shrubland, Northern Rocky Mountain-Vancouverian Montane-Foothill Grassland, and Great Basin and Intermountain (Sagebrush) Shrubland and Steppe were particularly important predictors for Oregon Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus affinis). Dynamic general vegetation model (DGVM) outputs, such as fire, fuels, and carbon were important predictors of these habitat types. In conclusion our results forecast significant climate-driven changes in vegetation for the region and highlight areas where nuanced management actions will be warranted.", "proj_items": {"586d8d0de4b0f5ce109fca03": {"item_summary": "These maps indicate the magnitude of multivariate climate change using the standardized Euclidean distance (SED). This metric allows the magnitude of climate change to be analyzed with respect to historical interannual variability for each climate variable. Standardizing climate change in this way allows multiple climate variables with different units to be combined into a single index, but more importantly, it places the magnitude of projected change in the perspective of what species have had to tolerate over recent history. These maps are based on multiple climate models ( CanESM2, MIROC5, MIROC_ESM_CHEM, and MRI_CGCM3 climate models ) for the periods 2035-2064 and 2070-2099 and are based on bioclimatic variables and seasonal climate variables.. Terrestrial ecosystems are vulnerable to future changes in the global climate, including increased temperatures, and changing precipitation patterns. We used multivariate analyses to collapse the many variables that go into climate-change models into climate gradients that were used to calculate the projected change in overall climate. These maps will be used to identify areas likely to experience the greatest changes in overall climate and areas that are projected to be refuges of relatively stable climate. As part of the development of climate change adaptation strategies, the maps can be used to assess the exposure of species to climate change.

remaining expanse of tidal salt marshes in the western U.S. These marshes are home to a variety of federal and state protected species, such as the California clapper rail, California black rail, and the salt marsh harvest mouse. The estuary is also located on the Pacific Flyway, and is an important site for migrating and wintering birds. As climate conditions change, these salt marshes face a number of threats, including accelerated rates of sea-level rise, shifting precipitation, erosion, and more frequent and intense storms. Seas in the San Francisco Bay estuary have been rising 2.2 centimeters per decade, and could rise by as much as 1.24 meters by 2100, according to some projections.   The goal of this project was to identify how marsh plant communities in the San Francisco Bay estuary might be impacted by sea-level rise through 2100. Understanding the changes in salt marsh habitat will help wildlife managers identify the possible effects on wildlife species, enabling managers to start developing adaptation strategies now. To do this, researchers collected elevation, vegetation, and water level data at 12 tidal salt marshes around the San Francisco Bay estuary between 2008 and 2011. Using this information, they predicted the rate of marsh growth (i.e. accretion) and changes in plant communities at the sites through 2100.   Results show that the effects of sea-level rise will increase threats to already vulnerable wildlife in the San Francisco Bay estuary. Although some parts of the study area are projected to maintain marsh vegetation through 2100, these areas only comprise 4 percent of the total marsh area surveyed. The remaining 96 percent of marshes in the study area are projected to transition to mudflats by 2100. In fact, most areas are projected to lose high and mid-marsh vegetation by 2050. This type of vegetation provides critical habitat to the salt marsh harvest mouse, California black rail, and nesting songbirds.

Sea level rise threatens the very existence of RMI as high-end projections of sea level rise by the end of the century exceed the average elevation of these low atoll reef islands. Already, waves wash over Majuro during \u201cking tides\u201d when strong winds blow from the west across the broad lagoon, or when there are high open ocean waves. Flooding waves breach island shores in multiple locations and wash into homes, cemeteries, across roads, and into commercial districts. Over the past decade, there has been a widespread exodus of residents to locations in Hawai\u02bbi and the continental U.S. as life becomes increasingly untenable on these low sand and gravel islands.  In order for Majuro and RMI leaders and decision makers to plan and implement a strategy for moving forward, scientific information and geospatial data are needed to model the timing and spatial pattern of future flooding in the first and most vulnerable areas. This project team will use a digital elevation model (DEM), currently under development, for the Majuro Atoll to model sea level rise and develop flooding simulations to help identify vulnerable areas. The team will also collect topographic and bathymetric data on Majuro to extend the areas covered by the DEM to provide a more comprehensive view of future wave flooding associated with sea level rise.  In later years of the project, the team plans to utilize existing data on groundwater and collect new information on Majuro\u2019s water table to model and understand water table dynamics in order to simulate inundation of saltwater into groundwater due to sea level rise. A primary goal of this project is to distribute project deliverables and provide training in their interpretation and application to Marshallese government agencies to inform mitigation and adaptation.

The goal of this project is to develop very high-resolution climate projections for the Hawaiian Islands over the period from 2010 to 2039. This timeframe is novel.

Also, this project will include estimates of variability, instead of the more usual focus only on average conditions. This research will provide insight into the range of possible climate futures for the Hawaiian Islands. These very high-resolution projections will be useful in the context of understanding future changes in Hawai\u2019i\u2019s hydrology and terrestrial ecosystems to inform cost-effective drought planning, flood control planning, water supply management, and ecosystem conservation.

Summers with extreme wildfire activity threaten life and property, clog the air with smoke, and challenge the state\u2019s wildland firefighters. While the largest fires are often started by lightning and burn in remote areas, these fires require significant resources to fight when they threaten life and property.   Increased wildfire activity is projected to continue in Alaska, as climate conditions change. Therefore, understanding how to best calculate fire risk based on short and long-term weather conditions is needed to improve fire season forecasts. Currently, Alaska\u2019s fire managers rely on the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index to monitor and forecast fire danger. Several other indices also exist, but have not been fully assessed to determine their usability in Alaska. The goal of this project is to understand which index best forecasts wildfires in Alaska. Researchers will then use these indices to project future seasonal trends in wildfire over the next century.   This project will support Alaska\u2019s fire managers in better understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing fire weather indices and how fire danger may change under future climate projections. This research is critical not only for short-term fire weather forecasting, but also to better understand how these models will perform under changing climate conditions. Researchers will work directly with the people who manage and forecast wildfires in Alaska, to ensure that their research can inform direct action and helps to improve forecasting and decision-making. Improvements to fire season forecasting will enable fire managers to more effectively plan for upcoming fire seasons and better allocate limited funds and firefighting resources.

Red brome (B. madritensis) is an invader in the Mojave Desert, and can similarly introduce a new fire patterns to sensitive warm desert scrub. These invasions often cause management agencies to incur high costs for prevention, control, restoration, and fire responses.   Control and prevention of invasive species is challenging because the risk of invasive plants becoming abundant depends on existing plant communities, climate and weather, land use, and fire history. Moreover, scientific information on invasion risk that does exist has not always been translated into maps that planners and resource managers can use in their decision making. Broad-scale information is needed to link geographic variation in climate and disturbances (e.g. fire) to decisions on the ground regarding where to apply treatments aimed at limiting the impacts of invasions and restoring native plant composition.   This project aims to use existing datasets to understand the links between the abundance of major plant invaders and climatic extremes, land use and fire history. The project team will examine how the drivers and limits of plant abundance vary among invasive species and across the Great Basin and Mojave Desert. For example, where is cheatgrass likely to be limited by drought and temperature extremes, and are those areas vulnerable to red brome invasion? Where should we be most concerned about annual grass invasion following wildfire? The project\u2019s main objectives are to (i) describe the climatic conditions under which plant invaders occur and reach high abundance; (ii) model spatial variation in the drivers of invader abundance; and (iii) develop map products linking risk of high invasive plant cover to resource management strategies (e.g. prevention, restoration, or tolerance).

This project sought to understand the ways in which Native American culture and cultural practices in the northwestern U.S. have been affected by climate change. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with tribal elders and cultural experts belonging to three Northwest tribes \u2013 the Confederated Tribes of Salish and Kootenai, the Qinault Indian Nation, and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians.  Researchers found that, in addition to altering some specific cultural practices, climate change is profoundly disrupting tribal identities. For tribes, one of the most significant effects of climate change is disturbance to the timing of natural cycles and seasonal changes, which have historically served as cues for culturally important activities. Many of the interviewees described a sense of unease associated with the fact that traditional wisdom may no longer be a sound basis for decision making, because environmental situations no longer match the information that has been passed down through generations. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the cultural effects of climate change on Northwest tribes and may serve as a resource for tribes to assess climate change impacts on their practices and identity.

Quantity of urban growth 10 at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers. Models were developed using circa 1990\u20132000 data and validated using change in the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Databases (NLCD). LTM and null models were assessed using the mean difference 15 in quantity between simulated and actual growth measured at multiple spatial scales. We found that LTM models performed relatively well at spatial scales as small as 450 m, and that the mean difference between the NLCD and LTM with meso-scale drivers at 900 m was 2\u20133%, whereas null models produced a mean difference of \u223c5%.

FRAME-SIMPPLLE is a collaborative modeling process designed to accomplish this goal by coupling the adaptive capabilities of the SIMPPLLE modeling system with accepted principles of collaboration. The two essential components of the process are FRAME (Framing Research in support of the Adaptive Management of Ecosystems), which creates a collaborative problem-solving environment, and SIMPPLLE (SIMulating Patterns and Processes at Landscape Scales), which is a vegetation dynamics modeling system. The resulting collaborative modeling process allows decision makers to optimize the management of multiple resources and evaluate the likely outcome of various choices. The approach involves collaboratively engaging resource managers, modelers, and scientists in framing the science issues embedded in key natural resource management issues and then developing the SIMPPLLE modeling approach to address those issues. Through a prototype collaborative modeling effort at Mesa Verde National Park, a process has been developed for adaptive, multi-objective resource management. What is needed now is an effort to refine the approach and establish a transportable methodology that is applicable across a wide range of ecosystems. In the Northern Rockies, managers have expressed an interest in exploring this approach at Glacier National Park, the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem, and the Rocky Mountain Front. This project utilized and evaluated the FRAME-SIMPPLLE approach to (1) explore adaptive management for climate and landscape change in the Northern Rockies, (2) recommend how to foster the long-term development of such collaborative planning tools as a joint effort between the USGS and the Institute of the Environment; (3) develop graduate student mentoring opportunities focused on collaborative planning and adaptive management science, and (4) investigate the use of GIS to further landscape science and conservation, especially related to energy development.

In the Southwest, tribes are already experiencing a range of impacts that are at least partially related to climate change. They include serious water quality and supply issues in the context of prolonged drought; reduced ability to grow or collect important traditional crops and raw materials; loss of forest resources from large and landscape-transforming wildfires exacerbated by drought, aridity, and insect infestations; and health impacts from heat waves, dust storms, and smoke from wildfires.

Factors such as low heat energy, short growing seasons, and cold winters prevent the survival of many crops. While considerable research has gone into assessing how to overcome some of these limitations, results suggest that climate change is already altering the equation, and will likely continue to do so. Some research suggests crop production for some varieties might advance northward in the state, leading to increases in yields and new varieties becoming viable. However, it\u2019s also projected that water stress may become an increasing challenge facing farmers. Further, some crops, such as the burgeoning peony market, are dependent on Alaska\u2019s cool climate and late summer season, and could be negatively impacted by warming temperatures.   Currently available tools are limited in their ability to help Alaska\u2019s farmers adjust to climate change, because they primarily focus on the effects of extreme winter temperatures. However, additional variables, such as day length, thaw dates, freeze dates, growing season length, and occurrence of extreme heat may all affect whether a particular crop can be grown in a particular location. To better support Alaska\u2019s small-scale growers, researchers will work with local farmers to first identify their immediate and long-term needs in relation to ongoing and potential future climate-related changes to crops. Next, researchers will develop fine-scale maps, tools, and datasets that meet these stakeholder-defined needs.

Commercial peony farming has experienced considerable growth in recent years, and it\u2019s estimated that in 2017 growers grossed between $900,000 and $1.8 million in sales. Further, as a perennial, peonies are potentially affected by changes in weather that occur throughout the year.   Alaska\u2019s high-latitude setting places it at the front lines of environmental change.

Developing a better understanding of avalanches and the processes leading to avalanche formation in the Juneau area is critical. This information would greatly aid local and regional efforts to forecast avalanches and update avalanche hazard maps, including the risk to transportation, utility, and mining corridors.  An important step in improving avalanche forecasting is identifying whether past avalanches were associated with particular climate or weather patterns. Certain variables, such as temperature and the amount and type of precipitation, can create the snowpack conditions that are necessary for widespread avalanche formation. Further, large scale climate patterns, such as El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, can have substantial effects on snowpack. However, there are no consistent historical records of avalanche incidence in Juneau. As a result, researchers will use dendrochronology \u2013 the study of tree rings \u2013 to date past large avalanche events in Juneau. They will then use monthly climate data to identify any relationships that may exist between avalanche activity and different climate and weather variables.  Changing climate conditions in southeast Alaska could alter future avalanche activity. This project responds directly to stakeholder needs by producing information and products that will help Juneau-area resource managers and emergency response personnel more clearly understand the potential impacts of a changing climate on avalanche activity.

For decades, upper mountain forests have provided refuge for Hawaiian forest birds because mosquitoes (and thus the disease) could not survive the cooler temperatures. However, warming associated with climate change could change this. Scientists used climate data and an epidemiological model to evaluate the future impacts of avian malaria on Hawaiian forest birds as a result of climate change. Results show that over the current century, anticipated changes in temperature and rainfall will favor increased mosquito populations and their expansion into high-elevation forests. These findings suggest that without significant intervention and mosquito control measures, many native Hawaiian honeycreepers will suffer major population declines and/or extinction due to increasing risk from avian malaria.

In September 2016, we partnered with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NY-DEC) to lead a 1-day scenario planning exercise focused on setting goals and objectives for a state-wide moose management plan. WCS then worked closely with scientists at the Northeast Climate Science Center to develop a set of future climate scenarios that are directly relevant to examining how the draft moose populations goals and objectives developed during the first workshop might hold up under different scenarios of climate change. These scenarios will be used by NY-DEC in Spring 2017 when they take their next steps to prepare a moose management plan for the state.  Results from this pilot project are being incorporated into a manuscript that will describe several recent uses of scenario planning by natural resource managers, and how lessons learned can help refine future uses of scenario planning for climate-informed wildlife management", "proj_items": {}, "num_items": 0}, "5bd860f9e4b0b3fc5ce9d8ec": {"proj_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5bd860f9e4b0b3fc5ce9d8ec", "proj_phrases": ["forests", "current range boundaries", "aerosol formation", "air quality", "different tree types", "aerosol yields", "project aims", "forest composition", "subsequent ozone", "management zone", "voc", "policy makers", "different", "tree species", "25 tree species", "vocs", "new forest landscape", "climate", "policy", "forest change", "air quality standards", "impact ozone", "climate change", "tree types emit", "natural precursors", "form ozone", "aerosol environment", "different capacity", "land managers", "volatile organic compounds", "relative contribution", "high-resolution models"], "avg_item_sim": 0.6669, "proj_summary": "Forests play a role in air quality by supplying the atmosphere with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), precursors to ozone and aerosols.

In fact, some places may serve as refuges for wildlife\u2014places where animals can remain or to which they can easily move to escape the worst impacts of climate change.   Currently, different datasets exist for identifying these resilient landscapes, known as climate refugia, but they are often not readily useable by wildlife managers. To address this need, researchers will map the locations of potential climate refugia for wildlife species in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. They will do this by synthesizing the existing datasets and adding in information on the locations of different species and their habitats. Researchers will work closely with wildlife managers from these three states, as well as with a broader group of federal, tribal, and non-governmental organization wildlife managers and planners, to select wildlife species of interest and design a digital atlas of climate refugia maps for each species of concern.   The resulting refugia atlas will allow natural resource managers and planners in the Pacific Northwest to identify specific areas where a given species of interest may be more likely to persist as the climate continues to change.

Maintaining healthy herds not only supports the ecosystems where these species are found, but also the hunting and wildlife watching communities. For example, in Wyoming, big game hunting contributed over $300 million to the state\u2019s economy in 2015. Yet as climate conditions change, the quantity, quality, and timing of vegetation available to mule deer, elk, and other ungulates, known as forage, could shift. It\u2019s possible that these changes could have cascading impacts on the behavior and population sizes of many species.  A key strategy used by managers to improve forage availability and adapt to change is the implementation of habitat treatments. These treatments include prescribed fire, forest thinning, and removal of invasive weeds, and are currently being planned to counteract the expected decline in mule deer habitat in the Kemmerer-Cokeville Area of southwestern Wyoming. To ensure that these activities are effective in meeting their goals, it is important for managers to have information on how forage conditions are already changing due to climate variability, and what any potential tradeoffs associated with these techniques may be.  Focusing on Montana and Wyoming, this project aims to meet this need by achieving three objectives. First, researchers will prepare summaries of past and future changes in forage by watershed, herd, and hunting area for both states. These summaries will help managers prioritize areas for management by providing baseline information about the direction, degree, and certainty of change in the quality and timing of forage. Second, researchers will assess changes in forage conditions in aspen, sagebrush, and mixed mountain shrub habitat in southwest Wyoming. They will develop maps of future forage based on scenarios that reflect probabilities of important weather patterns (such as drought), the current distribution of invasive cheatgrass (which decreases forage quality), and expected effects of planned habitat treatments, such as prescribed fire. Lastly, researchers will use these maps to evaluate the effects of treatment options on mule deer migration, fawning, and summer habitat, and on elk calving, migration, and habitat use.  The results of this project will be useful to a broad range of managers, including those with the states of Wyoming and Montana, and with federal agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Land Management.

Of further concern is the fact that drought conditions resulting from climate change could exacerbate existing water allocation issues in the region.   Researchers are examining the potential impacts of drought on wetland-dependent migratory waterbirds in the Central Valley and interior basins. First, researchers are identifying plausible future habitat scenarios, based on potential changes to climate and possible water allocation decisions that could be made in the two regions, and are determining what these scenarios would mean for waterbirds. Researchers are also modeling how habitat conditions affect bird populations, in order to uncover how projected changes to habitat could influence the long-term survival of waterbirds. Finally, researchers will create a decision-support tool communicating the potential effects of climate change on waterbirds to conservation planners.  The most pressing conservation issues in the Central Valley and interior basins are climate change and ongoing conflicts surrounding water allocation. This study addresses a need to understand the impacts of drought and water allocation policies in the regions on wetlands and the waterbirds that depend on them.

In addition to demonstrating the effects of various management practices, these plots will help to determine how much variability cotton production systems can tolerate before ecosystems and the services they provide are negatively affected.  This demonstration system is in high demand amongst regional stakeholders and will be implemented with the support of the South\u2010Central USDA Climate Hub, NRCS scientists, and Cotton Inc. It will contribute substantially to our collective understanding of the interactions between climate variability, soil health, and agricultural productivity in the Southern High Plains while equipping stakeholders with the knowledge they need to make appropriate management decisions for optimal agroecosystem health.

Detailed information on the extent and distribution of emergent marsh vegetation types throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico coast has been historically unavailable. In response, the U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Ducks Unlimited, Inc., and the Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, produced a classification of emergent marsh vegetation types from Corpus Christi Bay, Texas, to Perdido Bay, Alabama.  This study incorporates about 9,800 ground reference locations collected via helicopter surveys in coastal wetland areas. Decision-tree analyses were used to classify emergent marsh vegetation types by using ground reference data from helicopter vegetation surveys and independent variables such as multitemporal satellite-based multispectral imagery from 2009 to 2011, bare-earth digital elevation models based on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), alternative contemporary land cover classifications, and other spatially explicit variables. Image objects were created from 2010 National Agriculture Imagery Program color-infrared aerial photography. The final classification is a 10-meter raster dataset that was produced by using a majority filter to classify image objects according to the marsh vegetation type covering the majority of each image object. The classification is dated 2010 because the year is both the midpoint of the classified multitemporal satellite-based imagery (2009\u201311) and the date of the high-resolution airborne imagery that was used to develop image objects. The seamless classification produced through this work can be used to help develop and refine conservation efforts for priority natural resources.

Mitigating the negative effects of climate change, in particular increased drought frequency and severity, poses a major challenge to forest managers. Managers are searching for strategies that minimize the negative effects of drought on forests (i.e. increase their resistance to drought) and maximize the ability of forests to recover after a drought (i.e. improve their resilience). Evidence suggests that forests with certain combinations of tree species, sizes, and stem densities are better able to withstand and recover from drought.   The goal of this study is to identify which forest management practices best minimize drought impacts for a range of forest types and climates in the U.S. Researchers are using eight long-term forest management experiments that are already underway across the country to identify how different forest management practices can increase the resistance and resilience of forests to drought. Practices such as forest thinning, a technique in which certain trees are selectively removed to make room for others, have been shown to help reduce the stress experienced by the remaining trees during drought and to increase recovery rates following drought.   Taking action to protect forests from drought will have far-reaching implications, ranging from sustaining wildlife that rely on forests for habitat, to retaining the carbon storage capacity of forests, to maintaining the ability of forests to regulate water flow and soil quality. The findings of this work will directly inform the natural resource management community as to which management practices will best safeguard forests in the face of a changing climate and increasing drought.

These data can be utilized to not only examine differences in within-stand competition, as well the trends and impact of drought in different forests across a broad climatic gradient, but also the influence of interactions between drought and competition on forest growth.

Found in eleven western states, this important yet fragile ecosystem is dominated by sagebrush, but also contains a diversity of native shrubs, grasses, and flowering plants. It provides critical habitat for wildlife like pronghorn and threatened species such as the greater sage-grouse, and is grazed by livestock on public and private lands. However, this landscape is increasingly threatened by shifts in wildfire patterns, the spread of invasive grasses, and changing climate conditions. While sagebrush is slow to recover after fires, non-native grasses such as cheatgrass thrive in post-fire conditions and the spread of these species can increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires. These changes to the sagebrush ecosystems have implications for big game, threatened wildlife, and ranching.  To address this growing concern, resource managers will often try to limit the spread of exotic grasses after fire events by applying herbicides, or will help native species recover through seeding or planting. However, these treatments have mixed results, and poor success is often attributed to droughts, which make it more difficult for seeds and native plants to survive; to the limited amount of time in which these treatments can be applied (usually in the first year after a fire); or because the seeds or plants used aren\u2019t adapted to the environmental conditions of the location where they\u2019re applied.  The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the factors that affect post-fire treatment success. Researchers will use data collected from more than 300 fires over the last 40 years, after which treatments were applied. They will identify the impacts of drought on those treatments, how incorporating information on drought forecasts or extending the period over which treatments are applied could have altered the outcomes, and how managers can better select plant material that will be more adaptable to the conditions of planting locations. Addressing this knowledge gap has been identified as a high priority in the DOI Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy, by the BLM Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation Program, and by state management agencies in the West. The results of this project will support adaptive management of sagebrush ecosystems, which will be critical if these ecologically and economically important landscapes are to be maintained into the future.

Mapped habitat types are drawn from the Northeastern Terrestrial Habitat Classification System (NETHCS) and from some ecological system types identifed by Canadian ecologists as being unique to Canada. The NETHCS is based on NatureServe\u2019s Ecological Systems Classification, augmented with additional information from individual state wildlife classifications and other information specific to wildlife managers. A terrestrial ecological system is defined as a mosaic of plant community types that tend to co-occur within landscapes with similar ecological processes, substrates, and/or environmental gradients, in a pattern that repeats itself across landscapes. Systems occur at various scales, from \"matrix\" forested systems of thousands of hectares to small patch systems, such as cliffs, basin wetlands, or barrens on a particular bedrock type, of one or two hectares.

million people in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico. More than half of the Rio Grande\u2019s streamflow originates as snowmelt in Colorado\u2019s mountains, meaning that changes in the amount of snowmelt can impact the water supply for communities along the entire river. Snowmelt runoff is therefore an important component of water supply outlooks for the region, which are used by a variety of stakeholders to anticipate water availability in the springtime.   It is critical that these water supply outlooks be as accurate as possible. Errors can cost states millions of dollars due to mis-allocation of water and lost agricultural productivity. There is a perception that runoff forecast accuracy has declined over the last several decades in Colorado and New Mexico, making water supply outlooks less reliable. Declines in accuracy could be related to changes in climate and land cover; however, potential sources of error have not yet been examined in the upper Rio Grande basin.   This study aims to improve runoff forecast models for the upper Rio Grande. Researchers will identify potential sources of error in existing models, improve the representation of snowpack in models of the watershed, develop a new hydrologic model for the basin, and test this model\u2019s ability to forecast runoff. The end product of this study will be a tool for making improved runoff forecasts for the upper Rio Grande basin. The tool will be transferable to other snowmelt-dominated basins in the region that have similar characteristics. These improved runoff forecasts, in turn, can be used to develop more accurate water supply outlooks in the region, empowering stakeholders in the basin to plan their water use more effectively.

NHDPlus catchments.  Human impacts occurring throughout the Northeast and Midwest United States, including urbanization, agriculture, and dams, have multiple effects on the region\u2019s streams which support economically valuable stream fishes.  Changes in climate are expected to lead to additional impacts in stream habitats and fish assemblages in multiple ways, including changing stream water temperatures.  To manage streams for current impacts and future changes, managers need region-wide information for decision-making and developing proactive management strategies.  Our project met that need by integrating results of a current condition assessment of stream habitats based on fish response to human land use, water quality impairment, and fragmentation by dams and road crossings with estimates of which stream habitats may change in the future.  Results are available for all streams in the NE CSC region through a spatially-explicit, web-based viewer (FishTail).  With this tool, managers can evaluate how streams of interest are currently impacted by land uses and assess if those habitats may change with climate.  These results, available in a comparable way throughout the NE CSC, provide natural resource managers, decision-makers, and the public with a wealth of information to better protect and conserve stream fishes and their habitats.  These data are integrated into a web-based decision support viewer (FishTail): 1) current condition of streams determined from disturbances limiting stream fishes, 2) future conditions resulting from changes in climate, and, 3) changes in water temperature for key locations resulting from climate changes for all streams of the NE CSC region.

These mapping projects represent a major step forward in describing the current extent of ecosystems on the landscape, and provide resource management agencies and organizations with unprecedented access to spatial information on these systems. In a number of cases, the ranges of these maps overlap. As a result, staff of resource management agencies and organizations are faced with trying to determine how to use these multiple products to effectively and efficiently meet their needs.  To address this question in the Northeast and Midwest U.S., the NE CSC funded a project to critically evaluate these ecosystem or habitat mapping methods and to move toward standardization of these maps. The objectives of the project were to: (1) review and compare existing map products; (2) extend the map legends and identify legend elements (ecosystems) most vulnerable to climate change; (3) develop recommendations for an improved map for the region; and (4) produce an improved regional map. The four map products that span all or large parts of this area include: (1) Southeast GAP (SEGAP), (2) LANDFIRE EVT (Existing Vegetation Type), (3) NatureServe, (4) TNC.

Much of the region relies on warm-season convective precipitation \u2013 that is, highly localized brief but intense periods of rainfall that are common in the summer. This type of precipitation is a significant driver of climate and ecosystem function in the region, but it is also notoriously difficult to predict since it occurs at such small spatial and temporal scales. While global climate models are helpful for understanding and predicting large-scale precipitation trends, they often do not capture many of the smaller atmospheric and earth surface processes that influence local and regional precipitation trends, like convective precipitation.  To address this gap in climate modeling capabilities, researchers developed regional climate models that are better able to project small-scale precipitation patterns and localized extreme precipitation events. Researchers combined information about land surface and water conditions with weather and climate models in order to quantify the local-scale impacts of climate on water resources. This highly localized information will assist regional decision-makers in addressing the challenge of predicting precipitation in the South Central U.S., leading to a better understanding of potential future impacts on agriculture, fish and wildlife, water quality and availability, and cultural resources.

Our ability to manage sustainable fish, shellfish and other wildlife populations in the future will be seriously compromised unless we have a basic understanding of the coming changes and use this to develop mitigation and adaptation measures. The overall objective of this multi-agency research is to develop the baseline climatic and biological data, models, and tools to predict the cumulative impact of climate change on habitats and ecosystem services in a series of coastal estuaries of the Pacific Northwest. In collaboration with other federal, state, and non-governmental organization partners, USGS scientists developed predictions of climate-related alterations of the distribution and abundance of oysters and seagrass, both of which provide critical habitats that serve as nurseries for estuarine fishes and crabs. In addition, the project looked at climate impacts to tidal marsh, including effects on wetland restoration and juvenile salmon habitat. The research provides insights into future changes that impact wildlife and economically important species, and helps land managers understand the ramifications of the changes that are coming and what those changes may mean for both wildlife and the ecosystem services provided by these estuaries. Partner and collaborator organizations included in this research were the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the US Fish and Wildlife Agency, the US Department of Agriculture, the US Forest Service, The Nature Conservancy, Oregon State University, and the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology.

The scripts are written in the Python Language. Python is a freely-available, open-source scripting language that is object oriented and is supported by ArcGIS as a framework for creating and executing Geoprocessor tasks. Python also runs as a stand-alone programming language. The scripts were built using Python release 2.5.1, which is included with ESRI's ArcGIS 9.3.1. ArcGIS 9.3.x also supports Python version 2.5.4, but does not support later Python versions. Python is downloadable from http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.4/.  The PythonWin development environment provides a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for the python scripting editor. PythonWin is located in the \"Python for Windows extensions\" bundle available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/. To use the scripts provided, the user will need access to ArcGIS 9.x software and install the Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET). MGET is available at http://code.env.duke.edu/projects/mget. The first step involved in preparing HDF SDS files for conversion to ArcGIS GRID files (preceding use of the processing scripts) is a manual renaming of the files to conform to ArcGIS specifications; specifically, the rasters may have filenames no longer than 13 characters and must begin with a letter (they may not begin with a number or symbol). The original HDF filenames violate both of these rules. As file naming conventions are a personal preference, a name-converting script is not provided here. However, for clarity of the processing scripts provided, note that our file-naming convention is \"sstallyyyymm.hdf\" for SST rasters, and \"qualyyyymm.hdf\" for quality rasters (where y = year and m = month).  These scripts can be modified to the users' needs or run in sequence (as presented below) to obtain a similar dataset to those made available in this report. The point and polygon shapefile included in the data processing steps from the Associated Links located on this page.

Further, 74% of the jurisdictional boundaries of the Chickasaw and Choctaw Tribes are located within the basin.   Water resources in the basin have been stressed in recent years due to a multi-year drought and increasing demands for consumptive use by metropolitan areas in Oklahoma and Texas. Unfortunately, currently available projections of future precipitation across the region show a high degree of uncertainty, making it difficult for water managers to plan for the future.   The goal of this project is to provide resource managers with critical information on the impacts of climate change on flow in the Red River Basin. Researchers (1) used global climate models to make climate projections for the basin, and (2) developed models to determine the impacts of projected future climate conditions on stream flow. The modeling results can be used to evaluate future water supplies for water providers and flows for the environment.   The Red River Basin lies within the boundaries of three Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs), and the results of this project will help the LCCs and other managers reduce the impacts of floods and droughts and make decisions regarding the potential need for additional reservoirs or diversions of water into the Red River Basin.

associated droughts, wildfires, extreme storms etc.) threaten important water sources, forests, wildlife habitat, and ecosystems across the Southwest and throughout the entire U.S. These threats cross political and man-made boundaries and therefore need to be addressed at larger landscape-level and regional scales. \u201cLandscape conservation design\u201d is one method that can be used by land and resource managers to support large scale conservation and ensure that small scale and local actions contribute to a landscape level vision. The Desert Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) is working to develop a shared vision for conservation action in the Southwest through a collaborative process to identify shared conservation goals, stressors and vulnerabilities across Southwest landscapes, and potential management responses to changing climatic conditions.  Through this project, the Southwest Climate Science Center will support the Desert LCC in their efforts to collect data and information about important Southwest resources, create scenarios of the future that include the effects of climate change and other landscape stressors on important resources, and develop a list of possible collaborative adaptation responses that are useful and implementable by partners. The Desert LCC will be hosting initial workshops to bring together regional partners to incorporate existing information and ideas into a current assessment of resource conditions and facilitating broad stakeholder participation in the landscape conservation design process in pilot areas across the Southwest.  The Desert LCC will use these workshops to develop reports that will include a prioritization of science needed to support future landscape conservation design work, and recommendations for filling these information gaps.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.

The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast.

Unraveling the relationships between climate and population dynamics, and projecting them across time, advances ecological understanding that informs and steers sustainable conservation for species. Using pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) as an ecological model, we used a Bayesian approach to analyze long-term population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 subpopulations in the southwestern United States. We determined which long-term (12 and 24 months) or short-term (gestation trimester and lactation period) climatic conditions best predicted annual rate of population growth (\u03bb). We used these predictions to project population trends through 2090. Projections incorporated downscaled climatic data matched to pronghorn range for each population, given a high and a lower atmospheric CO2 concentration scenario. Since the 1990s, 15 of the pronghorn subpopulations declined in abundance. Sixteen subpopulations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and \u03bb, and in 13 of these, temperature was also significant. Precipitation predictors of \u03bb were highly seasonal, with lactation being the most important period, followed by early and late gestation. The influence of temperature on \u03bb was less seasonal than precipitation, and lacked a clear temporal pattern. The climatic projections indicated that all of these pronghorn subpopulations would experience increased temperatures, while the direction and magnitude of precipitation had high subpopulation-specific variation. Models predicted that nine subpopulations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. Results were consistent across both atmospheric CO2 concentration scenarios, indicating robustness of trends irrespective of climatic severity. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn subpopulations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence. This realization informs and steers conservation and management decisions for pronghorn in North America, while exemplifying how similar research can aid ungulates inhabiting arid regions and confronting similar circumstances elsewhere. Long-term data from annual aerial surveys of pronghorn subpopulations in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas were used to calculate annual rates of population growth (\u03bb). When subpopulation-specific harvest and translocation data were available, population estimates for calculating \u03bb were adjusted according to the following equation: \u03bbt = Nt/(Nt-1 - h - r + a), where \u03bbt is population change from time t-1 to t, Nt and Nt-1 are population estimates from current and previous surveys, respectively, h is number of pronghorn harvested, and r and a are number of individuals removed from and released into the population, respectively, through translocations. Only population estimates from surveys conducted in consecutive years were used to calculate \u03bb. If \u03bb = 2, the associated surveys were removed from analyses because \u03bb would be considered to be derived from unreliable or unstandardized population estimates, resulting in biologically unrealistic population growth rates. Monthly climate data (precipitation [mm/day] and mean temperature [degrees C]) were from 14 x 14 km cells from pronghorn range in each subpopulation in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas. Means across grids were calculated to obtain monthly values of precipitation and temperature. Two realistic future global climate scenarios were compared; a lower (Representative Concentrations Pathways 4.5) and a high (Representative Concentrations Pathways 8.5) atmospheric CO2 concentration scenario. Standardized precipitation index for 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month periods were calculated from all available monthly precipitation data using program SPI SL 6 (National Drought Mitigation Center 2014). Monthly mean temperature, total precipitation, and mean SPI (3-, 6-, and 12-month periods) were summarized by important periods in an adult female pronghorn's annual reproductive cycle relative to peak fawning (i.e., early, mid-, and late gestation [3 months each] and lactation [4 months]). Mean temperature and total precipitation were also calculated for 12 and 24 months preceding each population survey. Historic pronghorn population trends in relation to temperature and precipitation were assessed using integrated Bayesian population models. All models included a covariate for density effect (i.e., population in the previous year). Precipitation and temperature model comparison sets were run separately, and each model set included a null model (i.e., only density covariate, no climate covariates). These top individual precipitation and temperature covariates were then combined in models (i.e., one precipitation and temperature covariate per model), and these combined models were run including a term for the interaction between precipitation and temperature using the following equation: ln(\u03bbt) = Alpha + Beta1XN[t-1] + Beta2Xprec + Beta3Xtemp + Beta4Xprec*temp. Projected climate data for each pronghorn subpopulation was used to predict \u03bbt for each year to 2090. An integrated modeling approach was used, whereby the best performing model climatic predictors from historic population trends for each pronghorn subpopulation was embedded in that subpopulation pronghorn population projection model.", "title": "Impact of Drought on Southwestern Pronghorn Population Trends and Predicted Trajectories Climate Projection Data", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=59d256ece4b05fe04cc235d2", "proj_id": "52742044e4b097f32ac3f2ad", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59d256ece4b05fe04cc235d2", "fy": "2013", "purpose": "The pronghorn population survey data were collected to estimate annual rate of population growth (\u03bb) for subpopulations described herein.

Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change.

Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action.

We used the forest landscape change LANDIS PRO and hybrid empirical-physiological ecosystem model LINKAGES to model changes in forest biomass and species abundances and distribution in the North Atlantic region of the U.S. while accounting for climate change, succession, and harvest. Three climate scenarios were considered, defined by a general circulation model and emission scenario: PCM B1, CGCM A2, and GFDL A1FI. We then compared results from three alternative modeling approaches; LANDIS PRO, LINKAGES, and TreeAtlas for the Central Hardwood, Central Appalachian, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regions to determine agreement among models and establish a stronger inference for projected changes through model averaging.

Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action.

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes. The percentage of lakes with abundant largemouth bass and failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 59% in contemporary conditions to 86% of lakes by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the number of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 8.5% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 38 1% of lakes in both future periods. Importantly, we identify nearly 100 resilient lakes predicted to continue to support walleye recruitment. Management resources could target preserving these resilient walleye populations.

We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast.", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "parentId": "56e31328e4b0f59b85d3a577", "contacts": [{"name": "USGS Western Ecological Research Center", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist"}, {"name": "Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research Center , Research Ecologist", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "5355401de4b0120853e8bc0d": {"summary": "This data set contains output from the dynamic vegetation model MC1, as modified to simulate future woody encroachment in the northern Great Plains, for 23 monthly variables, 63 yearly variables, and 31 multi-year variables.

To estimate native and invasive species abundance in baseline climate conditions, a map was generated that considered abundance as percent cover and used high coefficient of variation values as a mask. The primary sources for post-processing the uncertainty masks are the Hawaiian Islands plant species abundance modeled means and standard deviation values (Wong et al., in preparation). These maps cover the entire landscape (including urban and agricultural areas), and therefore they can be applied in a variety of ways. Maps can be utilized to evaluate baseline climate conditions for each species and to forecast changes to community structure through expected shifts in species abundance. Maps can be combined in order to predict community dominance, for example, by identifying the most abundant native species at a given location. This can be applied to: 1) spatial and temporal assessments of habitat quality and community structure comparisons; 2) defining specific ecological restoration objectives; and 3) identifying potential for key invasive species to threaten a site (even where they are presently not found). Future projected abundances can enhance conservation planning both by anticipating where native species may increase or decrease in abundance and by identifying areas where invasive species may extend their range. Combining this with assessments of relative response rates can aid managers in prioritizing native species to promote and invasive species to preemptively control at a given site. Purpose: These data were compiled to provide context from other data products (e.g., correlative species abundance model maps, standard deviation value maps, habitat quality maps, and species relative response characteristics) such that areas with high uncertainty were identified and removed from species abundance model maps developed by Wong et al. (in preparation). These post-processed maps contribute to an initial set of supporting tools for managers and decision makers. However, given the inconsistency of their statistical performance between evaluation metrics, some of these exploratory abundance maps should be used with caution and with reference to high levels of uncertainty. As is the case with other macro-scale correlative models, they should be applied to management at a conceptual, landscape scale rather than for detailed management at local sites.", "title": "2015 Hawaiian Islands Plant Species Abundance Models", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a", "proj_id": "501190e1e4b0d78fd4e59ba8", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a", "fy": "2012", "purpose": "", "casc": "Pacific CASC", "parentId": "5046314fe4b0241d49d62c06", "contacts": []}, "5755d2f1e4b023b96ec1eb7c": {"summary": "This landcover raster was generated through a Random Forest predictive model developed in R using a combination of image-derived and ancillary variables, and field-derived training points grouped into 18 classes.

Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength?", "casc": "Southeast CASC", "parentId": "505b584be4b08c986b30c22d", "contacts": [{"name": "U.S. Geological Survey, National Wetlands Research Center", "type": "Distributor", "email": "mosland@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Michael Osland", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "mosland@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Michael Osland", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Andrew From", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Richard Day", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Jack Larriviere", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Mark Hester", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Jonathan Willis", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Erik Yando", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "566a172ce4b08895842a1e8f": {"summary": "This dataset represents the extent of urbanization (for the year indicated) predicted by the model SLEUTH, developed by Dr. Keith C.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Pt.

Changes in climate are expected to lead to additional impacts in stream habitats and fish assemblages in multiple ways, including changing stream water temperatures.  To manage streams for current impacts and future changes, managers need region-wide information for decision-making and developing proactive management strategies.

Results are available for all streams in the NE CSC region through a spatially-explicit, web-based viewer (FishTail).  With this tool, managers can evaluate how streams of interest are currently impacted by land uses and assess if those habitats may change with climate.

The U.S. Northern Rockies still support a full suite of native wildlife, and survival of these populations depends on connected landscapes. Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action. We also encountered high levels of uncertainty in how climate change is expected to alter vegetation and how wildlife are expected to respond to these changes. This uncertainty limits the value of our assessment for informing proactive management of climate change impacts on both species-specific and biome-level connectivity (although biome-level assessments were subject to fewer sources of uncertainty).

This data was developed for use in a landscape simulation modeling study aimed at evaluating how well alternative management strategies maintain whitebark pine populations under historical climate and future climate conditions. For the study, we developed three spatial management alternatives for whitebark pine in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem representing no active management, current management, and climate-informed management. These management alternatives were implemented in the simulaton model FireBGCv2 under historical climate and three future climate change scenarios - the HadGEM-ES, CESM1-CAM5, and CNRM-CM5 Global Circulation Models under the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario. We worked with the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee's (GYCC) Whitebark Pine Subcommittee to develop this spatial representation of their current management strategy. The treatments mapped represent a set of the treatments recommended in the GYCC Whitebark Pine 2011 Strategy document and include planting blister-rust resistant whitebark pine seedlings, competition removal thinning, wildland fire use and prescribed fire, and protection from mountain pine beetles using verbenone and carbaryl. We used historical and future projections of climate suitability based on species distribution models for whitebark pine (Chang et al. 2014) to map zones of core, deteriorating, and future whitebark pine habitat. Core zones were those areas that are currently suitable for whitebark and remain suitable in the future. Deteriorating zones were where the climatic conditions for whitebark pine are expected to decline. Future zones were areas that are projected to become newly suitable for whitebark pine. We then overlaid our climate zones for whitebark pine with similar projections of future climate suitability for all of whitebark pine\u2019s competitors - Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, and Douglas-fir (Piekielek et al. 2015. We discussed the different combinations of climate suitability zones (core, deteriorating, future) and potential future level of competition (low or high) from other species with the GYCC Whitebark Pine Subcommittee to determine which management activities should be prioritized within each management zone. The result is a map of management zones where different activities are prioritized to meet the goal of maintaining whitebark pine populations. This was used to determine which treatments would be implemented spatially during the simulation modeling, dependent upon additional criteria related to simulated stand-level conditions.

The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality).

Though these data may exist for particular wetlands, there are no wall-to-wall consistent datasets of wetland location and long-term hydrological dynamics. Climate change has emphasized the growing need to plan conservation actions across large landscapes and at a longer-term time scales.

Unit contour length is equal to the DEM resolution of 50 meters.   **There are two versions of both the CTI and SCA provided:**  *CTI_AKPCTR_NoFlowMask.tif and SCA_AKPCTR_NoFlowMask.tif* This is the resulting CTI file when no masks are applied to the study area before the CTI procedure is run. After the CTI procedure is run, all glacial areas are masked out, as CTI is not meaningful over glaciers.  *CTI_AKPCTR_FlowMask.tif and SCA_AKPCTR_FlowMask.tif* This is the resulting CTI file where prior to running the CTI procedure, we apply a mask across all active glaciers and all downslope cells receiving flow from glacially affected cells. These masked cells are excluded from the CTI procedure. This results in fewer CTI values on the landscape. This dataset is provided to identify cells in the direct downslope path of glaciers because CTI values for cells receiving upslope accumulation from glaciers may not be reliable due to uncertainties in surface water flowpaths in glaciated areas.  **Processing Steps:** 1. Using the pitremove function from [TAUDEM](http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/index.html), filled sinks in the DEM following the method of Planchon and Darboux (2001).  2. (For **_FlowMask* versions only) Mask out glacial areas and associated downslope cells. Prior to calculating flow direction and flow accumulation, change cells in the filled DEM to NoData where glaciers exist, using the [Randolph Glacier Inventory version 5.0](https://www.glims.org/RGI/rgi50_dl.html) raster dataset to identify the presence of glaciers. Cells downslope from the masked glaciers will then also be identified as NoData in subsequent processing and the final CTI raster. Compute D-infinity slopes and flow direction and flow accumulation (as specific catchment area) rasters from the filled DEM using TAUDEM D-infinity method. As part of the D-infinity routine, TauDEM uses the method of Garbrecht &amp; Martz (1997) to resolve flats.  3. The D-infinity slope raster was modified in the following way: if slope = 0, then change slope value to 0.0001; otherwise leave slope value unchanged. This was done to avoid dividing by zero when calculating CTI.  4. Compute Compound Topographic Index (CTI) using these steps: Dsca = D-infinity specific catchment area raster Dslp = D-infinity slope raster Then, CTI = Ln(Dsca/Dslp)  5.

SLEUTH, named for the model input datasets (Slope, Land use, Excluded, Urban, Transportation and Hillshade) is the evolutionary product of the Clarke Urban Growth Model that uses cellular automata, terrain mapping and land cover change modeling to address urban growth (Jantz et al, 2009; NCGIA 2011). SLEUTH provides urban growth projections which are useful across a range of applications; including wildlife habitat analysis, conservation planning, and land cover dynamics analysis. SLEUTH incorporates four growth rules (Spontaneous Growth, New Spreading Centers, Edge Growth and Road-Influenced Growth) to model the rate and pattern of urbanization. The model simulates not only outward growth of existing urban areas, but also growth along transportation corridors and new centers of urbanization. SLEUTH incorporates five parameters (Dispersion, Breed, Spread, Slope and Road Gravity) into the growth rules which project future urbanization. Possible parameter coefficient values range between 1 and 100. During calibration every possible combination of these five parameter coefficients (between defined start and stop values and by a defined step size) is applied to the growth rules, in order to find the combination that best matches past urbanization patterns observed in the training data. Once found, the model is run in prediction mode using these parameter values in the growth rules. The model produces one urban growth cycle per year.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys. This raster contains data from Pt. Mugu Marsh with the projection from the WARMER model.", "title": "SLR Projections, Pt.

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast.

The SAMBI DSL project used predicted urban growth models described herein to inform future landscape conditions that were also based climate change impacts and vegetative community succession. These future landscape conditions were then applied as a context for land use and management decisions in conservation planning.  SLEUTH, named for the model input datasets (Slope, Land use, Excluded, Urban, Transportation and Hillshade) is the evolutionary product of the Clarke Urban Growth Model that uses cellular automata, terrain mapping and land cover change modeling to address urban growth (Jantz et al, 2009; NCGIA 2011). SLEUTH provides urban growth projections which are useful across a range of applications; including wildlife habitat analysis, conservation planning, and land cover dynamics analysis. SLEUTH incorporates four growth rules (Spontaneous Growth, New Spreading Centers, Edge Growth and Road-Influenced Growth) to model the rate and pattern of urbanization. The model simulates not only outward growth of existing urban areas, but also growth along transportation corridors and new centers of urbanization. SLEUTH incorporates five parameters (Dispersion, Breed, Spread, Slope and Road Gravity) into the growth rules which project future urbanization. Possible parameter coefficient values range between 1 and 100. During calibration every possible combination of these five parameter coefficients (between defined start and stop values and by a defined step size) is applied to the growth rules, in order to find the combination that best matches past urbanization patterns observed in the training data. Once found, the model is run in prediction mode using these parameter values in the growth rules. The model produces one urban growth cycle per year. For each growth cycle, a GIF image is produced showing the probability of urbanization for each pixel.

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "parentId": "56e746c0e4b0f59b85d5b1c4", "contacts": [{"name": "USGS Western Ecological Research Center", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist"}, {"name": "Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research Center , Research Ecologist", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research Center , Research Ecologist", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "5c093485e4b0815414d0c300": {"summary": "Projected suitable habitat models were constructed in randomForest (R package, version 4.6-10) using a set of presence points for the species derived from element occurrence and herbarium records, together with temperature, precipitation, and soil variables.

Bioclimatic models were built using the Random Forest algorithm. Projected changes in vegetation were also modeled using the Random Forest algorithm but were produced by Rehfeldt et al. (2012). Projected current distribution is based on the average climate conditions for the years 1961-1990. Projected future distributions are based on average climate conditions for the years 2070-2099 using downscaled (30-second or ~1-kilometer resolution) climate projections from two Global Circulation Models: CGCM3.1 (T47) and UKMO-HadCM3. Both projections use the A2 emissions scenario and are from the CMIP3 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report) family of climate simulations. Due to changing climatic conditions, species ranges are expected to shift throughout the course of this century. Modeling subsequent shifts in suitable habitat for animal species, and the resulting changes in species assemblages, represent critical information for resource planners and managers. Developing robust suitability models for large geographic areas can be challenging, in part due to insufficient sampling data and to computational limits associated with modeling large geographies at a fine-grained spatial resolution. To overcome these challenges, I developed a method to model habitat suitability in which I built correlative climate suitability models for 366 terrestrial animal species at a relatively coarse spatial resolution for the entire North American continent using species range maps and 23 bioclimatic variables. I then applied the models to both current and projected future climate data downscaled to a moderately fine resolution for western North America. I refined the resulting climate suitability projections by applying a filter that limited suitability to areas in which suitable biomes were projected to be present. I verified my modeling results using an independent species occurrence data set, finding a median accuracy rate of 70%. I found that incorporating information about biomes into the models resulted in projections of larger climate-driven changes in suitability\u2014on average a difference of about 10%. My results also indicate that study species are more likely to see climate-driven losses than gains in habitat suitability. The percentage of study species projected to undergo a significant net decrease in habitat suitability was double the percentage projected to experience a net increase. These results highlight the shortcomings of many broad-scale models and highlight the need to take finer scale vegetation patterns into account. They also indicate that while many animal species could potentially benefit from climate-change induced increases in habitat suitability, the majority of species may suffer from substantial decreases, complicating future conservation efforts.", "title": "Projected habitat suitability for several vertebrate species in the Pacific Northwest based on projected climatic suitability, projected vegetation, and current land use", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57473c09e4b07e28b663d870", "proj_id": "5318ba1ae4b0ae6e9d5a3b7c", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57473c09e4b07e28b663d870", "fy": "2014", "purpose": "Here, I combine species distribution models based on climate variables with simple biome-level habitat associations to produce models that can project future impacts on species distributions based on projected changes in climate and vegetation, with a reasonable level of accuracy.

The study region includes all 503 counties in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. This data set was created to examine the first objective of the project. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI) data, available only at the climate-division level, were downscaled into county-level indices over the 1975-2010 period.

Although several drought indices are available; which captures somewhat different aspects of drought conditions (Heim 2000), the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI; Palmer 1965) and Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI; Karl 1986) are commonly used, highly regarded, and readily available metrics. The PDSI, a weekly index of long-term moisture conditions, is produced by NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center and is calibrated to \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 conditions for its own subset of a state known as a climate division, with 0.0 representing average soil moisture conditions at that climate division for that time of year. Positive values represent above-normal moisture conditions for that location and negative values suggest below-normal soil moisture. Because the water balance calculations for PDSI include lags to take into account deep soil moisture conditions, PDSI is often considered in many applications a reasonable and versatile index of medium-term moisture. For evaluating longer-term hydrological conditions, the PHDI may prove more useful, because it's even longer-lagged response to changes in moisture conditions may better reflect the changes in groundwater availability and reservoir supplies that would be characteristic of drought impacts on communities\u2019 long-term water supply and demand (Guttman 1991). These two indices remain the most widely used and cited measures of drought. The versatility and availability of the PDSI and PHDI on a near-real-time basis make these two indices most desirable for use by environmental planners.

Many recent changes in tree mortality, tree species distributions, and tree growth rates have been linked to changes in climate. Given that future climatic changes will likely surpass those experienced in the recent past, trees will likely face additional challenges as temperatures continue to rise and precipitation regimes shift. Managing forests in the face of climate change will require a basic understanding of which tree species will be most vulnerable to climate change and in what ways they will be vulnerable. We assessed the relative vulnerability to climate change of 11 tree species in western North America using a multivariate approach to quantify elements of sensitivity to climate change, exposure to climate change, and the capacity to adapt to climate change. Our assessment was based on a combination of expert knowledge, published studies, and projected changes in climate. The 11 species exhibited a range of vulnerabilities. Garry oak (Quercus garryana) was determined to be the most vulnerable, largely due to its relatively high sensitivity. Garry oak occupies some of the driest low woodland and savanna sites from British Columbia to California and is highly dependent on disturbances, such as periodic, low intensity fire. These low intensity and high frequency fires suppress competition and intrusion of Garry oak woodlands by conifers. Garry oak is also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and generally only dominates dry sites. Big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) was determined to be the least vulnerable of the 11 species, largely due to its adaptive capacity. Big leaf maple can reproduce quickly after disturbances and its seeds can disperse long distances potentially allowing it to move in response to a changing climate. Our analyses provide a framework for assessing vulnerability and for determining why some species will likely be more vulnerable than others.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.

Hierarchical modeling of urban growth across the conterminous USA: developing meso-scale quantity drivers for the Land Transformation Model. Journal of Land Use Science, 2012   The Land Transformation Model (LTM) is hierarchically coupled with meso-scale drivers to project urban growth across the conterminous USA. Quantity of urban growth 10 at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers. Models were developed using circa 1990\u20132000 data and validated using change in the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Databases (NLCD). LTM and null models were assessed using the mean difference 15 in quantity between simulated and actual growth measured at multiple spatial scales. We found that LTM models performed relatively well at spatial scales as small as 450 m, and that the mean difference between the NLCD and LTM with meso-scale drivers at 900 m was 2\u20133%, whereas null models produced a mean difference of \u223c5%.

Techniques were incorporated to accommodate a large number of classes and to predict the future occurrence of climates beyond the contemporary climatic range of the biomes. Errors of prediction from the statistical model averaged 3.7%, but for individual biomes, ranged from 0% to 21.5%. In validating the ability of the model to identify climates without analogs, 78% of 1528 locations outside North America and 81% of land area of the Caribbean Islands were predicted to have no analogs among the 46 biomes. Biome climates were projected into the future according to low and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios of three General Circulation Models  (cgcm, hadley, and consensus) for three periods, the decades surrounding 2030, 2060, and 2090. Prominent in the projections were (1) expansion of climates suitable for the tropical dry deciduous forests of Mexico, (2) expansion of climates typifying desertscrub biomes of western USA and northern Mexico, (3) stability of climates typifying the evergreen\u2013deciduous forests of eastern USA, and (4) northward expansion of climates suited to temperate forests, Great Plains grasslands, and montane forests to the detriment of taiga and tundra climates. Maps indicating either poor agreement among projections or climates without contemporary analogs identify geographic areas where land management programs would be most equivocal. Concentrating efforts and resources where projections are more certain can assure land managers a greater likelihood of success.  Because General Circulation Models (GCM) are key to understanding future climates, the tool we envision must take into account the variability in GCM output resulting from different model formulations and emissions scenarios. However, to land managers, variation represents uncertainty, and uncertainty often leads to inaction. Our approach was to emphasize similarities in responses projected from the disparate formulations rather than dwell on the differences. The tool must also contain provisions for identifying future climates with no contemporary analog because new climates may best be suited for species assemblages that do not exist today. To be useful, the scope of a vegetation model should be neither too broad to constrain local interpretation nor so parochial as to limit management options. It is mandatory, moreover, that this tool incorporates powerful statistical techniques that retain the robustness and flexibility necessary for anticipating and accommodating actual changes.  Our analysis uses the biotic communities of Brown (1994), mapped and digitized by Brown et al. (1998). This classification system meshes well with our goals: It is based on distributions of flora and fauna without reliance on physiography, the coverage includes all of North America, and altitudinal zonation of vegetation is an integral part of the system. For simplicity, we use the term \"biome\" to reference the biotic communities. Previous analyses used this classification system for modeling climatic control of biome distributions in western USA. These analyses produced errors of fit (~10%) that largely resulted from an imperfect alignment between digitized polygons in the classification system and the digital elevation model used to generate point estimates of biome climates. Misalignment had greatest impact at borders of polygons, along shore lines, and on mountain peaks, and therefore, was of greatest source of error with small, irregularly shaped polygons and for biomes occurring in altitudinal sequence. In this analysis, we considered biomes from throughout North America and used supplemental information to alleviate adverse effects of the misaligned data files.  We built on the statistical modeling of Rehfeldt et al. (2006) to predict contemporary realized climatic niches of North American biomes. Ecological niche models have received considerable criticism mostly because of their inability to represent migration or colonization potentials, competitive interactions, and effects of enhanced CO2 on water-use efficiency. The first of these is not an issue. Niche modelers themselves make no claims of projecting species distributions, but instead emphasize that their models project suitable climates. Likewise, competitive interactions that limit species distributions can be defined climatically and are invalidated only when future climates have no contemporary analog. By predicting and projecting the occurrence of novel climates, statistical models can negate this second point of contention. However, it is true that correlative models are not yet capable of accounting for physiological impacts of enhanced CO2 on gas exchange and productivity. Such effects, however, are well characterized in only a few species, and impacts on species distributions are unknown. More research is required before effects of enhanced CO2 can be incorporated with credibility into vegetation models, whether correlative or mechanistic.", "title": "North American vegetation model data for land-use planning in a changing climate:", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57475995e4b07e28b663d8dd", "proj_id": "5318ba1ae4b0ae6e9d5a3b7c", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57475995e4b07e28b663d8dd", "fy": "2014", "purpose": "Land managers require decision-support tools suitable for dealing with oncoming climate-mediated ecosystem changes.

Detailed information on the extent and distribution of emergent marsh vegetation types throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico coast has been historically unavailable. In response, the U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Ducks Unlimited, Inc., and the Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, produced a classification of emergent marsh vegetation types from Corpus Christi Bay, Texas, to Perdido Bay, Alabama.  This study incorporates about 9,800 ground reference locations collected via helicopter surveys in coastal wetland areas. Decision-tree analyses were used to classify emergent marsh vegetation types by using ground reference data from helicopter vegetation surveys and independent variables such as multitemporal satellite-based multispectral imagery from 2009 to 2011, bare-earth digital elevation models based on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), alternative contemporary land cover classifications, and other spatially explicit variables. Image objects were created from 2010 National Agriculture Imagery Program color-infrared aerial photography. The final classification is a 10-meter raster dataset that was produced by using a majority filter to classify image objects according to the marsh vegetation type covering the majority of each image object. The classification is dated 2010 because the year is both the midpoint of the classified multitemporal satellite-based imagery (2009\u201311) and the date of the high-resolution airborne imagery that was used to develop image objects. The seamless classification produced through this work can be used to help develop and refine conservation efforts for priority natural resources. This specific classification is an alternative product developed for Texas that includes three marsh types (that is, fresh, intermediate-brackish, and saline).

Planning for the effects of climate change in this region is a high priority for the Plains and Prairie Pothole LCC and managers at federal, regional, and local levels (e.g. North American Waterfowl Management Plan 2012). Climate models for the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) project increasing temperatures and little to no increases in precipitation (though potentially more variability), leading to reductions in wetland habitat through increased evapotranspiration (Johnson et al. 2010). Populations of waterfowl and other species often decrease during droughts (Sorenson et al. 1998), raising concerns that hunting opportunities could be compromised and that the long-term viability of non-game populations may be at risk. Changes in climate can also have indirect effects on biodiversity by driving changes in human land use. Warmer temperatures, resulting in longer crop growing seasons and changes in crop yields, could incentivize landowners to alter their land-management practices or to transition from less intensive grassland uses to intensive row crop production (Rashford et al. 2010), which alters habitats and wetland functions (Rashford et al. 2016).

Forage conditions in arid and semi-arid regions are driven by unpredictable spatial and temporal patterns in rainfall. Diet selection by herbivores should be directed towards overcoming the most pressing nutritional limitation (i.e. energy, protein [nitrogen, N], moisture) within the constraints imposed by temporal and spatial variability in forage conditions. We investigated the influence of precipitation-induced shifts in forage nutritional quality and subsequent large herbivore responses across widely varying precipitation conditions in an arid environment. Specifically, we assessed seasonal changes in diet breadth and forage selection of adult female desert bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis mexicana in relation to potential nutritional limitations in forage N, moisture and energy content (as proxied by dry matter digestibility, DMD). Succulents were consistently high in moisture but low in N and grasses were low in N and moisture until the wet period. Nitrogen and moisture content of shrubs and forbs varied among seasons and climatic periods, whereas trees had consistently high N and moderate moisture levels. Shrubs, trees and succulents composed most of the seasonal sheep diets but had little variation in DMD. Across all seasons during drought and during summer with average precipitation, forages selected by sheep were higher in N and moisture than that of available forage. Differences in DMD between sheep diets and available forage were minor. Diet breadth was lowest during drought and increased with precipitation, reflecting a reliance on few key forage species during drought. Overall, forage selection was more strongly associated with N and moisture content than energy content.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110).

This data was developed for use in a landscape simulation modeling study aimed at evaluating how well alternative management strategies maintain whitebark pine populations under historical climate and future climate conditions. For the study, we developed three spatial management alternatives for whitebark pine in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem representing no active management, current management, and climate-informed management. These management alternatives were implemented in the simulaton model FireBGCv2 under historical climate and three future climate change scenarios - the HadGEM-ES, CESM1-CAM5, and CNRM-CM5 Global Circulation Models under the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario. We worked with the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee's (GYCC) Whitebark Pine Subcommittee to develop this spatial representation of their current management strategy. The treatments mapped represent a set of the treatments recommended in the GYCC Whitebark Pine 2011 Strategy document and include planting blister-rust resistant whitebark pine seedlings, competition removal thinning, wildland fire use and prescribed fire, and protection from mountain pine beetles using verbenone and carbaryl. We used historical and future projections of climate suitability based on species distribution models for whitebark pine (Chang et al. 2014) to map zones of core, deteriorating, and future whitebark pine habitat. Core zones were those areas that are currently suitable for whitebark and remain suitable in the future. Deteriorating zones were where the climatic conditions for whitebark pine are expected to decline. Future zones were areas that are projected to become newly suitable for whitebark pine. We then overlaid our climate zones for whitebark pine with similar projections of future climate suitability for all of whitebark pine\u2019s competitors - Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, and Douglas-fir (Piekielek et al. 2015. We discussed the different combinations of climate suitability zones (core, deteriorating, future) and potential future level of competition (low or high) from other species with the GYCC Whitebark Pine Subcommittee to determine which management activities should be prioritized within each management zone. The result is a map of management zones where different activities are prioritized to meet the goal of maintaining whitebark pine populations. This was used to determine which treatments would be implemented spatially during the simulation modeling, dependent upon additional criteria related to simulated stand-level conditions.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site.

Unraveling the relationships between climate and population dynamics, and projecting them across time, advances ecological understanding that informs and steers sustainable conservation for species. Using pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) as an ecological model, we used a Bayesian approach to analyze long-term population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 subpopulations in the southwestern United States. We determined which long-term (12 and 24 months) or short-term (gestation trimester and lactation period) climatic conditions best predicted annual rate of population growth (\u03bb). We used these predictions to project population trends through 2090. Projections incorporated downscaled climatic data matched to pronghorn range for each population, given a high and a lower atmospheric CO2 concentration scenario. Since the 1990s, 15 of the pronghorn subpopulations declined in abundance. Sixteen subpopulations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and \u03bb, and in 13 of these, temperature was also significant. Precipitation predictors of \u03bb were highly seasonal, with lactation being the most important period, followed by early and late gestation. The influence of temperature on \u03bb was less seasonal than precipitation, and lacked a clear temporal pattern. The climatic projections indicated that all of these pronghorn subpopulations would experience increased temperatures, while the direction and magnitude of precipitation had high subpopulation-specific variation. Models predicted that nine subpopulations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. Results were consistent across both atmospheric CO2 concentration scenarios, indicating robustness of trends irrespective of climatic severity. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn subpopulations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence. This realization informs and steers conservation and management decisions for pronghorn in North America, while exemplifying how similar research can aid ungulates inhabiting arid regions and confronting similar circumstances elsewhere. Long-term data from annual aerial surveys of pronghorn subpopulations in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas were used to calculate annual rates of population growth (\u03bb). When subpopulation-specific harvest and translocation data were available, population estimates for calculating \u03bb were adjusted according to the following equation: \u03bbt = Nt/(Nt-1 - h - r + a), where \u03bbt is population change from time t-1 to t, Nt and Nt-1 are population estimates from current and previous surveys, respectively, h is number of pronghorn harvested, and r and a are number of individuals removed from and released into the population, respectively, through translocations. Only population estimates from surveys conducted in consecutive years were used to calculate \u03bb. If \u03bb = 2, the associated surveys were removed from analyses because \u03bb would be considered to be derived from unreliable or unstandardized population estimates, resulting in biologically unrealistic population growth rates. Monthly climate data (precipitation [mm/day] and mean temperature [degrees C]) were from 14 x 14 km cells from pronghorn range in each subpopulation in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas. Means across grids were calculated to obtain monthly values of precipitation and temperature. Two realistic future global climate scenarios were compared; a lower (Representative Concentrations Pathways 4.5) and a high (Representative Concentrations Pathways 8.5) atmospheric CO2 concentration scenario. Standardized precipitation index for 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month periods were calculated from all available monthly precipitation data using program SPI SL 6 (National Drought Mitigation Center 2014). Monthly mean temperature, total precipitation, and mean SPI (3-, 6-, and 12-month periods) were summarized by important periods in an adult female pronghorn's annual reproductive cycle relative to peak fawning (i.e., early, mid-, and late gestation [3 months each] and lactation [4 months]). Mean temperature and total precipitation were also calculated for 12 and 24 months preceding each population survey. Historic pronghorn population trends in relation to temperature and precipitation were assessed using integrated Bayesian population models. All models included a covariate for density effect (i.e., population in the previous year). Precipitation and temperature model comparison sets were run separately, and each model set included a null model (i.e., only density covariate, no climate covariates). These top individual precipitation and temperature covariates were then combined in models (i.e., one precipitation and temperature covariate per model), and these combined models were run including a term for the interaction between precipitation and temperature using the following equation: ln(\u03bbt) = Alpha + Beta1XN[t-1] + Beta2Xprec + Beta3Xtemp + Beta4Xprec*temp. Projected climate data for each pronghorn subpopulation was used to predict \u03bbt for each year to 2090. An integrated modeling approach was used, whereby the best performing model climatic predictors from historic population trends for each pronghorn subpopulation was embedded in that subpopulation pronghorn population projection model.", "title": "Impact of Drought on Southwestern Pronghorn Population Trends and Predicted Trajectories Predictor Model", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=59d254cce4b05fe04cc235b8", "proj_id": "52742044e4b097f32ac3f2ad", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59d254cce4b05fe04cc235b8", "fy": "2013", "purpose": "The pronghorn population survey data were collected to estimate annual rate of population growth (\u03bb) for subpopulations described herein.

Quantity of urban growth 10 at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers. Models were developed using circa 1990\u20132000 data and validated using change in the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Databases (NLCD). LTM and null models were assessed using the mean difference 15 in quantity between simulated and actual growth measured at multiple spatial scales. We found that LTM models performed relatively well at spatial scales as small as 450 m, and that the mean difference between the NLCD and LTM with meso-scale drivers at 900 m was 2\u20133%, whereas null models produced a mean difference of \u223c5%.

In this species, the supercooling point (SCP) is representative of mortality induced by acute cold exposure. Mountain pine beetle SCP and associated cold-induced mortality fluctuate throughout a generation, with the highest SCPs prior to and following winter. Using observed SCPs of field-collected D. ponderosae larvae throughout the developmental season and associated phloem temperatures, we developed a mechanistic model that describes the SCP distribution of a population as a function of daily changes in the temperature-dependent processes leading to gain and loss of cold tolerance. It is based on the changing proportion of individuals in three states: (1) a non cold-hardened, feeding state, (2) an intermediate state in which insects have ceased feeding, voided their gut content and eliminated as many ice-nucleating agents as possible from the body, and (3) a fully cold-hardened state where insects have accumulated a maximum concentration of cryoprotectants (e.g. glycerol). Shifts in the proportion of individuals in each state occur in response to the driving variables influencing the opposite rates of gain and loss of cold hardening. The level of cold-induced mortality predicted by the model and its relation to extreme winter temperature is in good agreement with a range of field and laboratory observations. Our model predicts that cold tolerance of D. ponderosae varies within a season, among seasons, and among geographic locations depending on local climate. This variability is an emergent property of the model, and has important implications for understanding the insect's response to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, as well as population response to climate change. Because cold-induced mortality is but one of several major influences of climate on D. ponderosae population dynamics, we suggest that this model be integrated with others simulating the insect's biology.", "title": "Modeling cold tolerance in the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae)", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57474116e4b07e28b663d884", "proj_id": "5318ba1ae4b0ae6e9d5a3b7c", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57474116e4b07e28b663d884", "fy": "2014", "purpose": "Our objective was to develop a process-based model of its cold tolerance that follows the general physiological principles of cold hardiness", "casc": "Northwest CASC", "parentId": "5318c6bfe4b0ae6e9d5a3bb3", "contacts": [{"name": "Meade Krosby", "type": "Process Contact", "email": "mkrosby@uw.edu", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Meade Krosby", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "mkrosby@uw.edu", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Jacques R\u00e9gni\u00e8rea", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Barbara Bentz", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "595ff366e4b0d1f9f0586811": {"summary": "", "title": "Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain Polygonal Tundra Geomorphology Map", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=595ff366e4b0d1f9f0586811", "proj_id": "503faaa3e4b09851b69ab403", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/595ff366e4b0d1f9f0586811", "fy": "2011", "purpose": "", "casc": "Alaska CASC", "parentId": "503fab83e4b09851b69ab40a", "contacts": [{"name": "Mark J.

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies. The sites were located in Padilla National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter Padilla), Port Susan Bay Preserve (hereafter Port Susan), Skokomish Estuary within lands of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (hereafter Skokomish), Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in southern Puget Sound (hereafter Nisqually), Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Grays Harbor), Tartlatt Slough within Willapa Bay National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Willapa), Siletz National Wildlife Refuge (hereafter Siletz), Bull Island within South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in Coos Bay (hereafter Bull Island), and Bandon National Wildlife Refuge on the Coquille Estuary (hereafter Bandon).

Cheatgrass is an invasive grass that has invaded much of the Great Basin. It grows from seed, usually early in spring, and rapidly matures, produces seed, and dies. Its presence can deplete early-season moisture reserves and put native vegetation at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, it contributes fine fuels that facilitate fire ignition and fire spread. Rangeland fires are often stand replacing events in sagebrush communities, commuities which historically dominated much of the northern Great Basin.

To get a copy of this software, please contact Apex RMS at path@apexrms.com. 1) Path models MUST be run with the provided .MCM and .trd mulitplier files to apply the required transition probability adjustments for procesess such as insect outbreaks, wildfire, and climate change trends. Each Path database is set up with three folders: - The 'Common' folder contains a single Path scenario (also named 'Common'). The Transitions tab within the Common scenario contains the climate-smart STM. - The 'Multipliers' folder contains multipliers specific to each ownership-allocation to activate or deactivate transitions (both climate change and management). Actual treatments are input in the Treatments tab for each stratum in the 'Runs' folder. - The 'Runs' folder contains one Path scenario per modeling stratum, with initial conditions specific to each stratum (combination of watershed and ownership-allocation). The models are stored as a dependency from the 'Common' folder and the multipliers as a dependency from the 'Multipliers' scenario. For the scenarios that have management activities (current and restoration management), a specified number of acres for each treatment is shown in the Treatments tab for treated stata. There are 6 databases, one for each combintation of management and climate scenario run in northwest Washington. Climate scenarios include: - No climate change - continuing current climate (NoCC) - Hadley global circulation model, A2 Emissions Scenario (Hadley) - RegCM3 regional circulation model, A2 Emissions Scenario (RegCM3) Management scenarios include: - No management - no restoration treatments (NoMgt) - Current management - current treatment rates compiled from managers in the region (CurMgt) 2) The lookup tables folder contains files necessary for providing definitions and context for the information located in other folders. 3) This folder contains the NWW region stratum map, called Modeling_Strata.tif. This map can be joined to output from the climate-informed state-and-transition models to map projected future condition or northern spotted owl habitat, on the \"Strata\" field. Modeling strata consist of the intersection of watershed (Hydrologic unit code [HUC]) and ownership-allocation map. Watersheds are three digit codes starting at 101. Ownership-allocation categories are a two-character label, and are described in the attribute table through the fields \"Ownership\", and \"Allocation\". The field ScenarioID indicates the internal ID number used by the Path software to link results for modeling strata to its Scenario names. 4) The \"Results\" folder contains summarized modeling results that can be viewed on their own, or displayed across mapped modeling strata. The .tif file within the 3Spatial folder shows the spatial distribution of modeling strata. There are 3 subfolders: ClassesSummary, TransitionSummary, and HabitatSummary. The csv files within ClassesSummary contain summaries of state class area (in Acres) for each timestep, over monte carlo repetitions, within each modeling stratum. Those within TransitionSummary are summarized in the same manner, but contain summaries of area affected by each Transition Type. The csv files within HabitatSummary are designed to be joined ot the grid mentioned above, to allow for a spatial depiction of habitat projections. There is one column per modeled year, containing a summary that indicates the proportion of each modeling stratum that is comprised of potential northern spotted owl habitat (averaged over monte carlo repetitions).

This analysis involved several steps. First, time-series climate data were compiled and plotted to identify drought periods. Similarly, time-series data representing insect outbreaks were compiled and plotted to identify trends in insect mortality. The study area was classified into forest canopy types using existing modeled estimates of tree basal area by tree species. Using remotely-sensed Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) from the Landsat archive, NDMI anomalies from reference conditions were calculated in 2001 and 2009.

The U.S. Northern Rockies still support a full suite of native wildlife, and survival of these populations depends on connected landscapes. Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action. We also encountered high levels of uncertainty in how climate change is expected to alter vegetation and how wildlife are expected to respond to these changes. This uncertainty limits the value of our assessment for informing proactive management of climate change impacts on both species-specific and biome-level connectivity (although biome-level assessments were subject to fewer sources of uncertainty).

This data set contains soil water infiltration measurements using Beerkan infiltration rings in four Oregon agricultural soils amended with biochar. Gasified biochars made from wheat straw (AgEnergy, Spokane, WA) and conifer wood (BioLogical, Philomath, OR) were tilled into soils at experimental stations in Madras (loam), Pendleton (silt loam), Aurora (sandy loam), and Klamath Falls (loamy sand). The biochars were incorporated by tillage in fall 2016 to a depth of 12 cm at rates equating to 0, 9, 18, and 36 Mg/ha (about 0.5, 1, 2, and 4% by mass in the tillage zone), with three replicate plots per treatment. In April and May 2017 infiltration was measured by inserting small rings into the soil surface and determining the time required for repeated 10 0mL volumes of water to infiltrate. From each infiltration experiment we estimated steady-state infiltration rate, and where possible we also estimated field saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Kfs). Diagnostic plots demonstrated that in about half of the measurements sets, Kfs could be estimated by modeling infiltration as a two-term function of sorptivity and Kfs. In the remaining plots, additional unknown factors that influenced infiltration prevented estimation of Kfs, possibly due to air entrapment, soil layering, or ring insertion effects in the remaining experiments. Increasing biochar amendment rates led to an increase in infiltration rate only for the CW biochar at the silt loam site.

Overall, these findings suggest selection from environmental factors may influence genomic variation at the ecosystem-scale in desert bighorn sheep and these results extend our understanding of how this subspecies may respond to different environmental conditions.", "casc": "National CASC", "parentId": "5c62d927e4b0fe48cb34c7e8", "contacts": [{"name": "Michael Buchalski", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Clinton Epps", "type": "Originator", "email": "clinton.epps@oregonstate.edu", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "James W Cain", "type": "Originator", "email": "jwcain@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": "Assistant Unit Leader, Research Wildlife Biologist"}, {"name": "Laura M Thompson", "type": "Originator", "email": "lthompson@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": "Research Biologist"}, {"name": "Ecosystems", "type": "USGS Mission Area", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "National Climate Adaptation Science Center", "type": "SDC Data Owner", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "U.S. Geological Survey - ScienceBase", "type": "Distributor", "email": "sciencebase@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "U.S. Geological Survey", "type": "Publisher", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "54492044e4b0f888a81b8915": {"summary": "", "title": "Monthly Mean (2010-2050) Maximum/Minimum Temperature and Total Precipitation in 2050 - BCCR BCM 2.0 (Months = 1,4,7,10, Jan, Apr, July, Oct)", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=54492044e4b0f888a81b8915", "proj_id": "4f833bd0e4b0e84f608680be", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/54492044e4b0f888a81b8915", "fy": "2009", "purpose": "", "casc": "National CASC", "parentId": "54491eb4e4b0f888a81b8912", "contacts": []}, "561bf9b1e4b0cdb063e583a0": {"summary": "Mean modeled snow-water-equivalent (meters) on April 1 for the reference (1989-2011) climate period.

Quantity of urban growth 10 at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers. Models were developed using circa 1990\u20132000 data and validated using change in the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Databases (NLCD). LTM and null models were assessed using the mean difference 15 in quantity between simulated and actual growth measured at multiple spatial scales. We found that LTM models performed relatively well at spatial scales as small as 450 m, and that the mean difference between the NLCD and LTM with meso-scale drivers at 900 m was 2\u20133%, whereas null models produced a mean difference of \u223c5%.

LERI assesses anomalies in actual evapotranspiration (ETa), as percentiles, across the Contiguous US and northern Mexico at a 1-km spatial resolution. LERI is based on the ETa data produced by the U. S. Geological Survey using the operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model. SSEBop combines evapotranspiration fraction generated from remotely sensed MODIS thermal imagery, acquired every 8 days, with climatological atmospheric evaporative demand. To quantify LERI, a rank-based, non-parametric method is used to estimate percentiles of the SSEBop ETa, over a period of ETa accumulation, compared to the available period of record (January 2000 to present). LERI percentiles are also binned into four drought categories (LD0 - LD3) analogous to the US Drought Monitor (USDM) categories (i.e. D0-D3) and using the same percentile breaks that USDM considers for soil moisture. By its numerical design, LERI essentially represents the evaporative response of the landscape driven primarily by the anomalous state of soil moisture to meet the climatological atmospheric demand through a combination of evaporation (from soil and leaf surfaces) and transpiration (root-stomata-air) processes. Real-time and high-resolution assessment of this soil moisture state is extremely salient to understanding and forecasting ecological responses. LERI serves as an experimental drought-monitoring and early warning guidance tool and has the potential to inform research into understanding characteristics of Ecological Drought. Preliminary work finds LERI to closely track modeled moisture conditions in the upper soil layers (~10 cm). LERI can complement other drought-monitoring indices and modeled soil moisture products. Work is ongoing to assess LERI\u2019s ability to capture signals of drought early warning, and its unique ability to assess land-surface moisture state.

The U.S. Northern Rockies still support a full suite of native wildlife, and survival of these populations depends on connected landscapes. Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action.

Each Path database is set up with three folders: - The 'Common' folder contains a single Path scenario (also named 'Common'). The Transitions tab within the Common scenario contains the climate-smart STM. - The 'Multipliers' folder contains multipliers specific to each ownership-allocation to activate or deactivate transitions (both climate change and management). Actual treatments are input in the Treatments tab for each stratum in the 'Runs' folder. - The 'Runs' folder contains one Path scenario per modeling stratum, with initial conditions specific to each stratum (combination of watershed and ownership-allocation). The models are stored as a dependency from the 'Common' folder and the multipliers as a dependency from the 'Multipliers' scenario. For the scenarios that have management activities (current and restoration management), a specified number of acres for each treatment is shown in the Treatments tab for treated stata. There are 6 databases, one for each combintation of management and climate scenario run in southwest Oregon. Climate scenarios include: - HadGEM global circulation model, representative concentration pathway 8.5 (Hadley) - NorESM global circulation model, representative concentration pathway 8.5 (NorESM) - MRI global circulation model, representative concentration pathway 8.5 (MRI) Management scenarios include: - Current Management - estimate extracted from LandTrendr dataset - Restoration management - a restoration scenario designed to help preserve owl habitat and diminish landscape susceptibility to catastrophic fire. 2) This \"lookup tables\" folder contains files necessary for providing definitions and context for the information located in other folders. 3) The 'Spatial' folder contains the SWO region stratum map, called Modeling_Strata.tif. This map can be joined to output from the climate-informed state-and-transition models to map projected future condition or northern spotted owl habitat, on the \"Strata\" field. Modeling strata consist of the intersection of watershed (Hydrologic unit code [HUC]) and ownership-allocation map. Watersheds are three digit codes starting at 101. Ownership-allocation categories are a two-character label, and are described in the attribute table through the fields \"Ownership\", and \"Allocation\". The field ScenarioID indicates the internal ID number used by the Path software to link results for modeling strata to its Scenario names. 4) The 'Results' folder contains summarized modeling results that can be viewed on their own, or displayed across mapped modeling strata. The .tif file within the 3Spatial folder shows the spatial distribution of modeling strata. There are 3 subfolders: ClassesSummary, TransitionSummary, and HabitatSummary. The csv files within ClassesSummary contain summaries of state class area (in Acres) for each timestep, over monte carlo repetitions, within each modeling stratum. Those within TransitionSummary are summarized in the same manner, but contain summaries of area affected by each Transition Type. The csv files within HabitatSummary are designed to be joined ot the grid mentioned above, to allow for a spatial depiction of habitat projections. There is one column per modeled year, containing a summary that indicates the proportion of each modeling stratum that is comprised of potential northern spotted owl habitat (averaged over monte carlo repetitions).

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.

The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast.

The U.S. Northern Rockies still support a full suite of native wildlife, and survival of these populations depends on connected landscapes. Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action.

This uncertainty limits the value of our assessment for informing proactive management of climate change impacts on both species-specific and biome-level connectivity (although biome-level assessments were subject to fewer sources of uncertainty).

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes. The percentage of lakes with abundant largemouth bass and failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 59% in contemporary conditions to 86% of lakes by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the number of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 8.5% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 38 1% of lakes in both future periods.

We also estimated the resistance of the landscape matrix to species movement based on the degree of naturalness of the land-cover type, with more natural land-cover types being less resistant to movement. We calculated the differences between the median value of landscape resistance between 2050 and 2011 for each county to evaluate changes in matrix permeability (i.e., resistance to species movement) for scenario A1B and B2.

We used the NHD streams and 30 m National Elevation Dataset (NED) data packaged with the NHD dataset. The UVB algorithm calculates a first-pass estimate of UVB using a GIS cost-distance approach (distance from stream times ground slope), and results are refined using a valley-filling procedure where a valley is \u201cflooded\u201d to a set flood height above the stream channel elevation. The flood height is set as a user-defined \u201cflood factor\u201d multiplied by bankfull depth. We used a flood factor of 6 in this analysis. The flood height is spread outward from the stream until it intersects a valley wall, and is further confined by a user-defined maximum ground slope (9%) and max valley width, which we set to 2000 m.  We used an annual mean precipitation value of 150 cm for the study area, and all other variables in the algorithm were set to defaults. Further details on the algorithm can be found in Nagel et al.

Changes in climate are expected to lead to additional impacts in stream habitats and fish assemblages in multiple ways, including changing stream water temperatures.  To manage streams for current impacts and future changes, managers need region-wide information for decision-making and developing proactive management strategies.

Results are available for all streams in the NE CSC region through a spatially-explicit, web-based viewer (FishTail).  With this tool, managers can evaluate how streams of interest are currently impacted by land uses and assess if those habitats may change with climate.

The U.S. Northern Rockies still support a full suite of native wildlife, and survival of these populations depends on connected landscapes. Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action. We also encountered high levels of uncertainty in how climate change is expected to alter vegetation and how wildlife are expected to respond to these changes. This uncertainty limits the value of our assessment for informing proactive management of climate change impacts on both species-specific and biome-level connectivity (although biome-level assessments were subject to fewer sources of uncertainty).

The code was developed in the R programming environment. The file \"sim_code.R\" contains the initialization of the parameters and analysis; the file \"pop_sim.ccp\" is a C++ program that executes the actual simulation and returns the results to R. We developed a hypothetical scenario in which a manager is tasked with control of invasive plants on 100 management units each 100 ha in size. 90 of these units were assumed to be under private management and 10 were assumed to be conservation units (i.e. under public management). For this problem we assumed that there were only two target species to control: leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) and yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris). These two species were identified of examples of species that are controlled within the LCC geography. They are also species for which there is some literature to help parameterize a model. We should note that this model is gross generalization and was not intended to provide insight into invasive species biology. Because this model is stochastic, we measured this objective as the number of years out of 50 that at least 50% of the units were uninfested. We arbitrarily chose the target of 50%, which could have been any value. However, we felt that because these species are so difficult to control, target of 50% was fairly attainable. The dynamics of the model assume that management units can either be infested with one of the species, both of them or none at all. We further assumed that once a unit was infested, the species immediately achieved some average density and began producing propagules. These propagules had to disperse some arbitrary distance before they could infest another unit. Once those seeds landed in an uninfested unit, there was some probability they would lead to an infestation. To describe infestation dynamics, we developed a model that was composed of eight states to describe the management units. The model simulates the dynamics of infestation and control and then produces an Expected Value of Information analysis that shows the improvement in performance given resolution of each uncertain parameter in the model.", "title": "Model simulation and Expected Value of Information code", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5783f9d0e4b0ac0b97f56038", "proj_id": "5012b1c2e4b05140039e0345", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5783f9d0e4b0ac0b97f56038", "fy": "2012", "purpose": "To evaluate the Epected Value of Information for resolving uncertainty in each model parameter.

However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management.

Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength?", "casc": "Southeast CASC", "parentId": "505b584be4b08c986b30c22d", "contacts": [{"name": "U.S. Geological Survey, National Wetlands Research Center", "type": "Distributor", "email": "mosland@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Michael Osland", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "mosland@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Michael Osland", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Andrew From", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Richard Day", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Jack Larriviere", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Mark Hester", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Jonathan Willis", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Erik Yando", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "58658fb4e4b0cd2dabe7c3d1": {"summary": "Establishing connections among natural landscapes is the most frequently recommended strategy for adapting management of natural resources in response to climate change. The U.S. Northern Rockies still support a full suite of native wildlife, and survival of these populations depends on connected landscapes. Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action. We also encountered high levels of uncertainty in how climate change is expected to alter vegetation and how wildlife are expected to respond to these changes. This uncertainty limits the value of our assessment for informing proactive management of climate change impacts on both species-specific and biome-level connectivity (although biome-level assessments were subject to fewer sources of uncertainty).

The Canadian River and other rivers in the Great Plains tend to have highly variable flows and harsh environmental conditions. The combination of these environmental conditions makes semi-arid and arid regions difficult to represent with a hydrologic model, especially extreme events. In some cases, overestimating flows may be acceptable to water managers (e.g., vulnerability of infrastructures), but could greatly affect estimates of fish species persistence. To address incidences where poor model performance affected metrics derived from Vflo simulations, we suggest three possible options. 1) Restrict flow-ecology relationships to the mainstem of the Canadian River below Lake Meredith, 2) Restrict assessments to streamflow data aggregated at a monthly time step (although typically, this does not match ecological processes well); 3) Focus on streamflow metrics with a high prediction accuracy (e.g., magnitude, timing and duration at some locations). To maximize the number of potential explanatory variables and survey locations available in the Canadian River basin for the development of flow-ecology response models and minimize bias and uncertainty, a combination of these approaches is likely warranted.

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes. The percentage of lakes with abundant largemouth bass and failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 59% in contemporary conditions to 86% of lakes by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the number of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 8.5% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 38 1% of lakes in both future periods. Importantly, we identify nearly 100 resilient lakes predicted to continue to support walleye recruitment. Management resources could target preserving these resilient walleye populations.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site.

WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "parentId": "56e746c0e4b0f59b85d5b1c4", "contacts": [{"name": "USGS Western Ecological Research Center", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist"}, {"name": "Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research Center , Research Ecologist", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research Center , Research Ecologist", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "5591d136e4b0b6d21dd6755a": {"summary": "In the expectation that global climate will change steadily in the coming decades, this research project had the goal to obtain a more detailed view of the climatic changes that Hawai\u2019i could experience by the mid and late 21st century. Given the importance of rainfall for Hawaiian ecosystems and freshwater reserves, this project investigated past seasonal rainfall pattern and developed a statistical model to estimate future rainfall changes for the major islands. As a result of this research, high-resolution maps and data are now available that researchers can use to study potential impacts on endangered species, or use the rainfall changes as input in decision-support tools.This data product provides data files that present future climate change rainfall scenarios for the Hawaiian Islands. The data products are served in GIS compatible formats, text-based spreadsheet tables, and the scientific data format NetCDF. Furthermore, figure files in PDF format are part of the distribution. The data product contains information on future rainfall change scenarios for the main Hawaiian Islands (Kauai, Oahu, Maui Nui, and Hawaii) for two time periods in the 21st century 2041-2070 and 2071-2099. In addition, some information from the historical 19th to 20th century are provided. The statistical downscaling method worked with station rainfall data. Geospatial interpolation methods were applied to create spatially interpolated gridded maps and contour files for the main Hawaiian Islands. The rainfall anomaly maps are provided in different resolutions (3km, 250m, and 0.5 minute resolution in longitude and latitude). In addition to the anomaly maps, we included seasonal rainfall climatology maps as references (base maps). These base maps, which were obtained from the Rainfall Atlas of Hawaii products (Giambelluca et al., 2013; http://rainfall.geography.hawaii.edu/) are provided at 250m resolution. This data product contains spatially interpolated maps with information on the skill of the statistical downscaling method. These data files and maps serve as a guidance for the user, in which regions the downscaled rainfall scenarios come with lower or higher confidence. In addition the product provides maps in 3km resolution with statistics on the frequency of future rainfall anomalies in five distinct categories: very dry, dry, neutral, wet, very wet conditions (details are provided in the accompanying README file that is part of this distribution).

Detailed information on the extent and distribution of emergent marsh vegetation types throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico coast has been historically unavailable. In response, the U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Ducks Unlimited, Inc., and the Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, produced a classification of emergent marsh vegetation types from Corpus Christi Bay, Texas, to Perdido Bay, Alabama.  This study incorporates about 9,800 ground reference locations collected via helicopter surveys in coastal wetland areas. Decision-tree analyses were used to classify emergent marsh vegetation types by using ground reference data from helicopter vegetation surveys and independent variables such as multitemporal satellite-based multispectral imagery from 2009 to 2011, bare-earth digital elevation models based on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), alternative contemporary land cover classifications, and other spatially explicit variables. Image objects were created from 2010 National Agriculture Imagery Program color-infrared aerial photography. The final classification is a 10-meter raster dataset that was produced by using a majority filter to classify image objects according to the marsh vegetation type covering the majority of each image object. The classification is dated 2010 because the year is both the midpoint of the classified multitemporal satellite-based imagery (2009\u201311) and the date of the high-resolution airborne imagery that was used to develop image objects. The seamless classification produced through this work can be used to help develop and refine conservation efforts for priority natural resources.

A recent survey of 80 managers of floodplain conservation lands along the Upper and Middle Mississippi and Lower Missouri Rivers in the central United States found that the most critical information needed to improve floodplain management centered on metrics for characterizing depth, extent, frequency, duration, and timing of inundation. These metrics can be delivered to managers efficiently through cloud-based interactive maps. To calculate these metrics, we interpolated an existing one-dimensional HEC-RAS hydraulic model for the Lower Missouri River, which simulated water surface elevations at cross sections spaced (&lt;1 kilometer) to sufficiently characterize water surface profiles along an approximately 800 kilometer stretch upstream from the confluence with the Mississippi River over an 80-year record at a daily time step. To translate these water surface elevations to inundation depths, we subtracted a merged terrain model consisting of floodplain LIDAR and bathymetric surveys of the river channel. We completed these calculations for an 800 kilometer stretch of the Missouri River, spanning from Rulo, Nebraska to the river's confluence with the Mississippi River. This approach resulted in a 29,000+ day time series of inundation depths across the floodplain using grid cells with 30 meter spatial resolution. This dataset presents 17 metrics for each of two scenarios, one using a baseline timeseries of stages from the HEC-RAS simulation and one using a timeseries of stages adjusted to account for changes in discharge under one possible climate change scenario. These metrics are calculated on a per pixel basis and encompass a variety of temporal criteria generally relevant to flora and fauna of interest to floodplain managers, including, for example, the average number of days inundated per year within a growing season. We also include a series of maps of water depths across the floodplain by return interval for each scenario, and the minimum return interval at which each pixel is inundated.

We installed four SETs at each marsh site, following methods described by Cahoon et al. 2002 and Webb et al., 2013. We established two SETs in low marsh and two in high marsh at each site after visual assessment of vegetation composition and distance from tidal source. We deployed each SET with three feldspar marker horizon plots. When the SET instrument is attached to the installed bench mark, the SET provides a constant reference plane in space from which the distance to the sediment surface can be measured by means of pins lowered to the sediment surface. SET measurements will be taken by reading the heights of nine pins lowered to the sediment surface using the SET instrumentation at 4 directions, which are 90 degrees from each other. Repeated measurements of elevation can be made with high precision because the orientation of the table in space remains fixed for each sampling. We are conducting on-going measurements every three months at all sites. We installed surface elevation tables (SETs) at our seven study sites between September and December 2013 (n = 24) to evaluate present-day changes in marsh surface elevation. As of the time of this report, we collected two to seven baseline readings at each site (Figure 24; Table 12). Early results suggest that the magnitude of marsh surface elevation change varied within sites and between low and high tidal marsh. Net marsh surface elevation change was positive in both high and low marsh in Bolinas and Mad River. In contrast, surface elevation declined in high marsh locations at Morro, Pt.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.

Study sites were located in the upper McKenzie (McK) River watershed, approximately 100 km east of Corvallis, Oregon, on the western slope of the Cascade Range and in the Middle Fork Willamette (MFW) watershed, located to the south of the McKenzie.  The sites were designated based on elevation, with a range of 1110-1480 m.  Distributed snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) observations were collected via monthly manual snow courses from 1 November through 1 April and bi-weekly thereafter. Snow courses spanned 500 m of forested terrain and 500 m of adjacent open terrain.  Snow depth observations were collected approximately every 10 m and SWE was measured every 100 m along the snow courses with a federal snow sampler.  These data are raw observations and have not been quality controlled in any way.  Distance along the transect was estimated in the field.    OSU_SnowDepth Summary: 10-minute snow depth observations collected at OSU met stations in the upper McKenzie River Watershed and the Middle Fork Willamette Watershed during Water Years 2012-2014.  Each meterological tower was deployed to represent either a forested or an open area at a particular site, and generally the locations were paired, with a meterological station deployed in the forest and in the open area at a single site.  These data were collected in conjunction with manual snow course observations, and the meterological stations were located in the approximate center of each forest or open snow course transect.  These data have undergone basic quality control.  See manufacturer specifications for individual instruments to determine sensor accuracy.  This file was compiled from individual raw data files (named \"RawData.txt\" within each site and year directory) provided by OSU, along with metadata of site attributes.  We converted the Excel-based timestamp (seconds since origin) to a date, changed the NaN flags for missing data to NA, and added site attributes such as site name and cover.  We replaced positive values with NA, since snow depth values in raw data are negative (i.e., flipped, with some correction to use the height of the sensor as zero).  Thus, positive snow depth values in the raw data equal negative snow depth values.  Second, the sign of the data was switched to make them positive. Then, the smooth.m (MATLAB) function was used to roughly smooth the data, with a moving window of 50 points.  Third, outliers were removed.  All values higher than the smoothed values +10, were replaced with NA. In some cases, further single point outliers were removed.

However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management.

Research findings revealed that CBM is understood as both a method for generating data useful for decision-making and an expression of governance itself, rooted in understandings of stewardship, kinship and responsibility. Our findings also suggest that data quality and credibility, trust and legitimacy and relevance to decision contexts are key to mobilizing CBM data in relevant decision-making processes. We provide three recommendations to improve linkages between CBM programs and Indigenous governance: Indigenous governments must take a leading role in CBM programs; networked capacity between Indigenous governments can be built using a bridging organization; and CBM programs should be closely coupled with Indigenous environmental governance strategies.

To buffer against global change, an established adaptation strategy is designing protected areas to increase representation and complementarity of biodiversity features. Uncertainty regarding the scale and magnitude of landscape change complicates reserve planning and exposes decision makers to risk of failing to meet conservation goals. Conservation planning tends to treat risk as an absolute measure, ignoring the context of the management problem and risk preferences of stakeholders. Application to conservation of risk management theory emphasizes diversification of portfolio of assets, with the goal of reducing the impact of system volatility on investment return. We use principles of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which quantifies risk as the variance and correlation among assets, to formalize diversification as an explicit strategy for managing risk in climate\u2010driven reserve design. We extend MPT to specify a framework that evaluates multiple conservation objectives, allows decision makers to balance management benefits and risk when preferences are contested or unknown, and includes additional decision options such as parcel divestment when evaluating candidate reserve designs. We apply an efficient search algorithm that optimizes portfolio design for large conservation problems and a game theoretic approach to evaluate portfolio tradeoffs that satisfy decision makers with divergent benefit and risk tolerances, or when a single decision maker cannot resolve their own preferences. Evaluating several risk profiles for a case study in South Carolina, our results suggest that a reserve design may be somewhat robust to differences in risk attitude but that budgets will likely be important determinants of conservation planning strategies, particularly when divestment is considered a viable alternative. We identify a possible fiscal threshold where adequate resources allow protecting a sufficiently diverse portfolio of habitats such that the risk of failing to achieve conservation objectives is considerably lower. For a range of sea\u2010level rise projections, conversion of habitat to open water (14\u2010180%) and wetland loss (1\u20107%) are unable to be compensated under the current protected network. In contrast, optimal reserve design outcomes are predicted to ameliorate expected losses relative to current and future habitat protected under the existing conservation estate.", "title": "Spatial conservation planning under uncertainty: adapting to climate change risks using modern portfolio theory", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5d24a317e4b0941bde64fb4e", "proj_id": "553fddf0e4b0a658d7938ef5", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d24a317e4b0941bde64fb4e", "fy": "2015", "purpose": "", "casc": "Southeast CASC", "parentId": "553fde8ee4b0a658d7938f09", "contacts": [{"name": "Mitchell Eaton", "type": "Author", "email": "meaton@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist"}, {"name": "Simeon Yurek", "type": "Author", "email": "syurek@usgs.gov", "orcId": "0000-0002-6209-7915", "jobTitle": "Ecologist"}, {"name": "Zulqarnain Haider", "type": "Author", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Julien Martin", "type": "Author", "email": "julienmartin@usgs.gov", "orcId": "0000-0002-7375-129X", "jobTitle": "Research Wildlife Biologist"}, {"name": "Fred A Johnson", "type": "Author", "email": "fjohnson@usgs.gov", "orcId": "0000-0002-5854-3695", "jobTitle": "Research Wildlife Biologist"}, {"name": "Bradley J.

The extension does not require extensive on-glacier measurements or computational expense but still relies on physical principles over empirical relations as much as is feasible while maintaining model usability.

Even small rainfalls create visible plumes over a few hours. Sediment affects coastal user enjoyment by deteriorating both ecosystem quality and visibility. Sources of erosion include unimproved roads, fallow and active agricultural fields, disturbed forests, local development, and streambanks. This is the primary output dataset from this project, which mapped bank erosion hotspots, constructed a reconnaissance sediment budget for the West Maui watersheds, and constructed a calibrated decision-support model capable of estimating sediment reduction from management actions.   Mapping, field experiments, and analysis of recent and historic rainfall were used to estimate sources of land-based pollution for watersheds in West Maui, Hawaii, and UH translated these findings into a calibrated Bayesian Belief Network Model that estimates spatially explicit erosion under a range of scenarios and management alternatives.  An overall sediment budget was constructed for the watersheds, describing the proportion of sediment coming from each source. A sediment budget (see Dietrich and Dunne, 1978) is a table of sediment loads, typically arranged by geomorphic process, enabling users to focus mitigation on sediment sources about which they expect to be most concerned.  Findings from this field assessment were used to inform a decision-support model. We developed an opinion-based Bayesian Belief model to estimate spatially explicit streambank erosion from rainfall events.

Primary water level loggers and conductivity loggers were deployed in major tidal channels connecting the marshes to the estuary. Secondary water level loggers were deployed in the upper reaches of second-order tidal channels to capture high tides and determine inundation patterns. Water level readings were collected every six minutes. We used data from the primary water level logger at each site to develop local hydrographs and inundation rates. Loggers were surveyed by RTK GPS at least once during the period of deployment. We corrected all raw water level data with local time series of barometric pressure using Solinst barometric loggers (Model 3001, Solinst Canada Ltd., Georgetown, Ontario, Canada), additional Hobo loggers (Model U-20-001-01-Ti, Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA, USA) or barometric pressure from local airports (distance less than 10 miles).

The water level data was used to estimate local tidal datums for all sites using procedures outlined in the NOAA Tidal Datums Handbook (NOAA 2003). Only local MHW and MHHW was calculated because the loggers were positioned in the intertidal and therefore could not be used to compute lower datums. Mean tide level (MTL) was estimated for each site by using NOAA\u2019s VDATUM model (v.3.4) at the location of the primary water level logger or at a nearby site in the estuary if the VDATUM model domain did not include the water level logger location.

The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions.

The objective of this research was to better understand some of the ecological implications of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The potential ecological effects of mangrove migration are diverse ranging from important biotic impacts (e.g., coastal fisheries, land bird migration; colonial nesting wading birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., response to sea level rise and drought; habitat loss; coastal protection) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage; water quality). In this research, our focus was on the impact of mangrove forest migration on coastal wetland soil processes and the consequent implications for coastal wetland responses to sea level rise, ecosystem resilience, and carbon storage. Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength?", "casc": "Southeast CASC", "parentId": "505b584be4b08c986b30c22d", "contacts": [{"name": "U.S. Geological Survey, National Wetlands Research Center", "type": "Distributor", "email": "mosland@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Michael Osland", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "mosland@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Andrew From", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Michael Osland", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Richard Day", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Jack Larriviere", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Mark Hester", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Jonathan Willis", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Erik Yando", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "58828bc6e4b0dc04318c5d23": {"summary": "In the southwestern US, the meteorological phenomenon known as atmospheric rivers (ARs) has gained increasing attention due to its strong connections to floods, snowpacks and water supplies in the West Coast states. Relatively less is known about the ecological implications of ARs, particularly in the interior Southwest, where AR storms are less common. To address this gap, we compared a chronology of AR landfalls on the west coast between 1989-2011 and between 25-42.5\u00baN, to annual metrics of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; an indicator of vegetation productivity) and daily-resolution precipitation data to assess influences of AR-fed winter precipitation on vegetation productivity across the southwestern US. We mapped correlations between winter AR precipitation during landfalling ARs and 1) annual maximum NDVI and 2) area burned by large wildfires summarized by ecoregion during the same year as the landfalls and during the following year. The data produced by this study include four sets of eight raster grids (total = 32 grids) representing Spearman Rank correlation coefficients for four types of comparisons across eight different latitudinal bands.

Environmental variables were resampled to a consistent projection (WGS1984) with 250m grid cell resolution.    We examined data distribution and data gaps, and correlations between variables were assessed using a Pearson correlation coefficient. To estimate relative importance of predictors, we used species-specific response curves and variable importance plots. Individual model fit was assessed using residuals against fitted values plots, null and residual deviance values, and model comparisons using relative Akaike information criterion (AIC). We examined predictive performance of modeling approaches by first using 10 fold cross-validation then area under the curve (AUC) with an independent evaluation set.    Final models were built with a continuous second degree polynomial GLM model with second degree polynomial substrate variable removed, and no interactions.

Bald eagles, an ecologically and culturally significant apex predator, congregate seasonally in high densities on salmon spawning rivers across the Pacific Northwest. One of the largest eagle concentrations is in the Skagit River watershed, which connects the montane wilderness of North Cascades National Park to the Puget Sound. Using multiple long-term datasets, we evaluated the relationship between local bald eagle abundance, chum and coho salmon availability and phenology, and the number and timing of flood events in the Skagit River. We analyzed both changes over time as a reflection of climate change impacts, as well as differences between managed and unmanaged portions of the river. We found that peaks in chum salmon and bald eagle presence have advanced at remarkably similar rates (~0.45 days/year), suggesting synchronous phenological responses within this trophic relationship.Yet the temporal relationship between chum salmon spawning and flood events, which remove salmon carcasses from the system, has not remained constant. This has resulted in a paradigm shift whereby the peak of chum spawning now occurs before the first flood event of the season rather than after. The interval between peak chum and first flood event was a significant predictor of bald eagle presence: as this interval grew over time (by nearly a day per year), bald eagle counts declined, with a steady decrease in bald eagle observations since 2002. River section was also an important factor, with fewer flood events and more eagle observations occurring in the river section experiencing direct hydroelectric flow management.", "title": "Biological and Hydrological Data from the Skagit River Ecosystem, Washington, USA 1968-2016", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5b7daa78e4b045b1dc7beb95", "proj_id": "5b7d7363e4b045b1dc7bd69c", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b7daa78e4b045b1dc7beb95", "fy": "2017", "purpose": "Data were collected to assess the population status and trends of bald eagles and salmon in the Skagit River; to monitor hydrological conditions (i.e., river flow); and to inform management of Skagit River ecosystem, including both natural and man-made components.", "casc": "National CASC", "parentId": "5b7d7a19e4b045b1dc7bd72e", "contacts": [{"name": "Madeleine A Rubenstein", "type": "Point of Contact", "email": "mrubenstein@usgs.gov", "orcId": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8569-781X", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Roger Christophersen", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Jason I.

We visually assessed percent cover of all plant species within a 0.25 m2 quadrat, and recorded the average and maximum height (measured to the nearest centimeter) of each species. Total plant cover in a plot could exceed 100% due to vegetation layering. Vascular plant nomenclature generally follows Baldwin et al. (2012) and Cook et al. (2013). We located 69 tidal wetland species in 2,154 vegetation plots across the nine estuaries in the study. Common species included Carex lyngbyei, Sarcocornia perennis, Distichlis spicata, Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus balticus and Potentilla anserina. The frequency of several common species varied markedly across the sites. Distichlis spicata dominated the flora at five of the nine sites, but was relatively uncommon at Port Susan and Grays Harbor. Deschampsia cespitosa, a middle to high marsh tussock-forming species was frequent at the three Oregon sites and at Willapa but much less common in Puget Sound marshes. The high marsh rush, Juncus balticus, was most frequent at Siletz and absent or rare at Willapa and Padilla. Carex lyngbyei occurrence was variable regionally, ranging from &gt;75% frequency at Bull Island to near absence at Padilla (it did not occur in any surveyed plots, but a few plants were observed at the upland margin of the site in late 2014). See appendices for detailed site specific results. We delineated marsh zones using long-term NOAA tidal data combined with our site-specific elevation and water level data and examined plant abundance in these major zones across the sites. At many sites, plant composition tended to vary by zone, but not necessarily in consistent ways across the region. For instance, at Bandon, Sarcocornia perennis was the most abundant high marsh species (with Deschampsia cespitosa most abundant in middle and low marsh), while S. perennis was the most abundant plant in low marsh at Grays Harbor (Carex spp. dominated in mid-marsh and Potentilla anserina dominated high marsh). Vertical zonation of plant assemblages was less pronounced at other sites, including Nisqually where Distichlis spicata had the highest mean cover in all three major marsh zones. Low marsh habitat was common at Bull Island, Willapa, Nisqually, and Port Susan. Common species in this zone included Sarcocornia perennis, Distichlis spicata, Carex lyngbyei, and Triglochin maritima. Middle tidal marsh was present at all of the sites and particularly common at Skokomish. Common species included all of the aforementioned taxa and Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus balticus, and Agrostis stolonifera. High marsh was only common at Bandon, Siletz, Willapa, Grays Harbor, and Padilla. Common high marsh species included many species found in other zones, but also included Potentilla anserine and Atriplex prostrata. Transition zone habitat (defined as wetland flooding at least once per year but no more than once per month) was limited at most of our study sites.

The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.", "casc": "Northwest CASC", "parentId": "5af4a8b3e4b0da30c1b44ecd", "contacts": [{"name": "U.S. Geological Survey - ScienceBase", "type": "Distributor", "email": "sciencebase@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Chase Freeman, USGS Western Ecological Research Center", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "cfreeman@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Karen Thorne, US Geological Survey", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Christopher Janousek, Oregon State University", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "56e85948e4b0f59b85d712ee": {"summary": "", "title": "SLR Metadata Document", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=56e85948e4b0f59b85d712ee", "proj_id": "504756d5e4b067bd38f7f457", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/56e85948e4b0f59b85d712ee", "fy": "2012", "purpose": "", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "parentId": "56e746c0e4b0f59b85d5b1c4", "contacts": [{"name": "Karen M Thorne", "type": "", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": "Ecologist (Landscape)"}]}, "56059204e4b058f706e514b0": {"summary": "Derived from the LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation data (http://www.landfire.gov/vegetation.php).

A 70 m north-south oriented transect of 5 snow depth sensors was deployed to record sub-daily snow depth, with co-located meteorological instruments. The sensors traversed a 40 m long elliptical forest gap and the adjacent forest in both directions. The locations were the same as those used previously to quantify how shortwave and longwave radiation vary across a forest gap [Lawler and Link, 2011]. Two additional snow depth sensors and meteorological stations were deployed at \u201cinterior forest reference\u201d and \u201copen reference\u201d sites, situated 80 m southeast and 1200 m west, respectively, from the main transect. Whereas the forest reference site was similar to the surrounding forest, the open reference site was much more exposed than the forest gap.

However, if forests can be managed to retain snow longer, some of these environmental and financial impacts may be mitigated. Recent results from our research team demonstrate that in areas with relatively warm winters, strategically-cut forest gaps could offset climatic warming by increasing snow retention on the landscape and delaying runoff. However, in areas with colder winters, the opposite is true, as snow lasts longer under the forest canopy. We will map these climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect snow duration in different locations and testing those predictions against careful observations from our field sites and a network of citizen scientists. Working with regional forest and water managers, we will identify strategies for applying these findings to decision-making, linking climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management.

These data were used to calibrate the one-dimensional Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model. These data and the SHAW calibration have previously been described in multiple publications, particularly Chauvin et al 2011 and Flerchinger et al 2016. In the dataset presented here, climate scenarios have been constructed, applied to the historic record, simulated in the SHAW model, and hydrologic results have been analyzed. These data include the following: (1) uscData. These are the historical data described above, prepared for input into the SHAW model with three hydrologic response units (HRU), labeled \u201caspen\u201d, \u201chighsage\u201d, and \u201clowsage.\u201d (2) synthetic_data: These directories contain synthetic data representing climate scenarios, with corresponding names. Climate scenarios were constructed in the script, \u201cclimate_analyze.R.\u201d Climate scenarios input to this script were obtained from the Integrated Scenarios project: http://climate.nkn.uidaho.edu/IntegratedScenarios/. Historic (1950-2005) and future (2050-2099, RCP 8.5) climate projections were obtained for the grid cell containing Upper Sheep Creek. Seasonally variable daily mean changes in temperature and precipitation were derived by comparing historical and future data; these were stored as \u201cdelta functions\u201d (in delta.csv). For each seasonally variable scenario, the effective mean annual change in precipitation or temperature was calculated, and this was applied in the same amount for each day of the water year. The naming convention is as follows: txpydz, where \u201cx\u201d is the temperature deviation from the delta function identified by comparing historical data with 2050-2099 RCP8.5. \u201cy\u201d is the precipitation deviation from the original delta function. X or y values equal to NA indicate that the precipitation or temperature was not changed. \u201cz\u201d indicates whether the simulation is seasonally constant (z = 1) or variable (z = 0). An empirically-derived drift function was applied to each of these scenarios in order to determine effective precipitation after snow drifting (Chauvin et al 2011). (3) model_runs: This directory contains all the files necessary to run the SHAW model. For more information on the SHAW model inputs and outputs, see ShawUsers.30.docx, or ftp site: ftp://ftp.nwrc.ars.usda.gov/public/ShawModel/. In these scenarios, the .exe files named for each HRU contain the names of the .inp files. Providing these .exe files as an input to SHAW allows for SHAW to be run automatically from an R script. The script, \u201crun_shaw_windows.R\u201d contains the code needed to run SHAW. To use this code, we recommend reading the script and changing the directory paths at the beginning of it to suit your needs. This script takes several hours to run on a laptop computer, particularly for the aspen HRU (~10 minutes per scenario on MacbookPro 2015 with 2.7GHz Intel Core i5 and 8GB RAM running Windows in Parallels). (4) model_output: These folders contain the outputs of the SHAW model after runs with the scenarios as described above. Within each HRU directory, each folder is named for one scenario, and contains the output files corresponding to that scenario. The output files are named only after the type of file (e.g., water.out). For that reason, the directory structure provided here is critical to the interpretability of these data. This folder also contains a hydrologic response unit not included in \u201csynthetic_data.\u201d In the \u201cas\u201d folder, aspen HRU site characteristics, including weather, have been used, but aspen have been replaced with grasses to simulate the effects of aspen mortality. (5) Tabular_results: This folder contains .csv files that summarize the data contained in the model_output folder over different time periods and for different analysis objectives. Each of these .csv files is created within the workflow described in the R script, \u201crun_shaw.R\u201d. (6) R: This folder contains scripts used to run the analyses for this project.

Human impacts occurring throughout the Northeast and Midwest United States, including urbanization, agriculture, and dams, have multiple effects on the region\u2019s streams which support economically valuable stream fishes.  Changes in climate are expected to lead to additional impacts in stream habitats and fish assemblages in multiple ways, including changing stream water temperatures.  To manage streams for current impacts and future changes, managers need region-wide information for decision-making and developing proactive management strategies.  Our project met that need by integrating results of a current condition assessment of stream habitats based on fish response to human land use, water quality impairment, and fragmentation by dams and road crossings with estimates of which stream habitats may change in the future.  Results are available for all streams in the NE CSC region through a spatially-explicit, web-based viewer (FishTail).  With this tool, managers can evaluate how streams of interest are currently impacted by land uses and assess if those habitats may change with climate.  These results, available in a comparable way throughout the NE CSC, provide natural resource managers, decision-makers, and the public with a wealth of information to better protect and conserve stream fishes and their habitats.  These data are integrated into a web-based decision support viewer (FishTail): 1) current condition of streams determined from disturbances limiting stream fishes, 2) future conditions resulting from changes in climate, and, 3) changes in water temperature for key locations resulting from climate changes for all streams of the NE CSC region.

A recent survey of 80 managers of floodplain conservation lands along the Upper and Middle Mississippi and Lower Missouri Rivers in the central United States found that the most critical information needed to improve floodplain management centered on metrics for characterizing depth, extent, frequency, duration, and timing of inundation. These metrics can be delivered to managers efficiently through cloud-based interactive maps. To calculate these metrics, we interpolated an existing one-dimensional HEC-RAS hydraulic model for the Lower Missouri River, which simulated water surface elevations at cross sections spaced (&lt;1 kilometer) to sufficiently characterize water surface profiles along an approximately 800 kilometer stretch upstream from the confluence with the Mississippi River over an 80-year record at a daily time step. To translate these water surface elevations to inundation depths, we subtracted a merged terrain model consisting of floodplain LIDAR and bathymetric surveys of the river channel. We completed these calculations for an 800 kilometer stretch of the Missouri River, spanning from Rulo, Nebraska to the river's confluence with the Mississippi River. This approach resulted in a 29,000+ day time series of inundation depths across the floodplain using grid cells with 30 meter spatial resolution. This dataset presents 17 metrics for each of two scenarios, one using a baseline timeseries of stages from the HEC-RAS simulation and one using a timeseries of stages adjusted to account for changes in discharge under one possible climate change scenario. These metrics are calculated on a per pixel basis and encompass a variety of temporal criteria generally relevant to flora and fauna of interest to floodplain managers, including, for example, the average number of days inundated per year within a growing season. We also include a series of maps of water depths across the floodplain by return interval for each scenario, and the minimum return interval at which each pixel is inundated.

Each site had one or two loggers (n = 16). We placed loggers at the mouth and upper reaches of second-order tidal channels to capture high tides and determine seasonal inundation patterns. Water loggers collected water level readings every six minutes starting on the date of deployment and continuing to the present. We used data from the lowest elevation logger at each site to develop local hydrographs and inundation rates. We surveyed loggers with RTK GPS at the time of deployment and at each data download that occurred quarterly, to correct for any vertical movement. We corrected all raw water level data with local time series of barometric pressure. For Solinst loggers, we deployed independent barometric loggers (Model 3001, Solinst Canada Ltd., Georgetown, Ontario, Canada); for Hobo water level loggers, we used barometric pressure from local airports (distance less than 10 miles). To determine tidal channel salinities, we deployed one conductivity logger at each site next to the lower elevation water level logger (Odyssey conductivity/temperature logger, Dataflow Systems Pty Limited, Christchurch, New Zealand). We converted specific conductance values obtained with the Odyssey loggers to practical salinity units using the equation from UNESCO (1983). We used water level data to estimate local tidal datums for all sites using procedures outlined in the NOAA Tidal Datums Handbook (NOAA, 2003). We only calculated local MHW and MHHW because the loggers were positioned in the intertidal, which is relatively high in the tidal frame, and therefore did not capture MLW or MLLW and could not be used to compute these lower datums. We estimated mean tide level (MTL) for each site by using NOAA\u2019s VDATUM 3.4 software (vdatum.noaa.gov), except at Bandon where we used MTL directly from historic NOAA data. Many results in this report are reported relative to local MHHW calculated from local water data. Water level loggers deployed within marsh channels recorded variation in water levels and salinity throughout the study duration. Loggers often did not capture lower portions of the tidal curve because of their location in tidal marsh channels which frequently drain at lower tides. From peak water levels, we calculated site-specific tidal datums (MHW and MHHW), and information on the highest observed water level (HOWL) during the time series. Our site specific tidal datum calculations generally closely matched tidal datums computed at nearby NOAA stations (tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). Differences likely reflect site-specific tidal and bathymetric conditions in local estuarine hydrology. We collected salinity data at all sites, however, due to equipment recalls and failure we do not have salinity data for the duration of the study. We report weekly maximum salinities since many of our salinity loggers were not submerged during the entire tidal cycle at all sites, except for Grays Harbor due to recalled loggers and loggers being washed away during storm events. We observed a high level of variation in salinity between and within sites. Siletz experienced the greatest variation in salinity during the study period, ranging from 0.8 to 32 ppt. Willapa was the freshest system, ranging from 12-15 ppt and had very little temporal variation. The largest variation in salinity at most sites occurred from September through December. All sites had salinity below 35 ppt throughout most of the year; however, the highest salinities were measured in August.

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. The research was conducted at nine tidal marshes in coastal estuaries spanning the Washington and Oregon coastlines from Padilla Bay in northern Washington to Bandon located at the mouth of the Coquille River in southern Oregon (Figure 3). These sites are managed by local NGOs (non-governmental organization), Native American tribes and federal or state agencies.

In Oklahoma alone, it\u2019s estimated that $157 million will be required to restore rangelands to their native conditions. Of further concern is the fact that projected changes in climate indicate that the region will continue to experience hotter and drier conditions, meaning that fire risks will continue to increase unless proper management strategies, such as prescribed fire, are implemented. In order to develop effective fire management responses, ongoing research into the changing scope and intensity of fire regimes in the region needs to be better connected to management practitioners and their expertise.This project will help managers respond to changing fire regimes by analyzing historical climate observations and future projections to identify days which are suitable for prescribed burns as well as days of high wildfire potential. Results from the analysis will be presented and discussed at a fire summit convening leading researchers, agencies, and land owners. The summit will also bring together fire experts to discuss the safe and proper application of fire in a changing and variable climate, along with management strategies for fire and its role in combating invasive plant species, maintaining productive landscapes, and enhancing wildlife habitat.", "title": "Fire Risk Frequency Analysis of the South Central Plains (1996-2015)", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=59959353e4b0fe2b9fea7547", "proj_id": "551ec027e4b027f0aee3b952", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59959353e4b0fe2b9fea7547", "fy": "2015", "purpose": "This dataset was created to analyze the 20-year change in the number of days that were suitable for prescribed burns across the Southern Plains.

Quantity of urban growth 10 at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers. Models were developed using circa 1990\u20132000 data and validated using change in the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Databases (NLCD). LTM and null models were assessed using the mean difference 15 in quantity between simulated and actual growth measured at multiple spatial scales. We found that LTM models performed relatively well at spatial scales as small as 450 m, and that the mean difference between the NLCD and LTM with meso-scale drivers at 900 m was 2\u20133%, whereas null models produced a mean difference of \u223c5%.

Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength? To address these questions, we utilized the salt marshes and natural mangrove forest structural gradients present at three distinct locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Cedar Key (Florida), Port Fourchon (Louisiana), and Port Aransas (Texas). Each of these locations represents a distinct combination of climate-driven abiotic conditions. We quantified relationships between plant community composition and structure, soil and porewater physicochemical properties, hydroperiod, and climatic conditions. The suite of measurements that we collected provide initial insights into how different geographic areas of an ecotone, with different environmental conditions, may be impacted by mangrove forest expansion and development, and how these changes may alter the supply of specific ecosystem goods and services.

Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action.

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110. We used NRC\u2019s average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "parentId": "56e746c0e4b0f59b85d5b1c4", "contacts": [{"name": "USGS Western Ecological Research Center", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist"}, {"name": "Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research Center , Research Ecologist", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research Center , Research Ecologist", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "5af4cc2ce4b0da30c1b44f6b": {"summary": "We used WARMER, a 1-D cohort model of wetland accretion (Swanson et al. 2014), which is based on Callaway et al. (1996), to examine SLR projections across each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area. Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts over the unit area model domain. The total volume of an individual cohort is estimated as the sum of the mass of pore space water, sediment, and organic matter, divided by the cohort bulk density for each annual time step. Elevation is adjusted relative to sea level rise after each year of organic and inorganic input, compaction, and decomposition. We parameterized WARMER from the elevation, vegetation, and water level data collected at each site. We evaluated model outputs between 2010 and 2110 using marsh elevation zones defined above.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenariosIn WARMER, we incorporated a recent forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 12, 64 and 142 cm by 2110, respectively (NRC 2012). We used the average annual SLR curve as the input function for the WARMER model. We assumed the difference between the maximum tidal height and minimum tidal height (tide range) remained constant through time, with only MSL changing annually.Inorganic matterThe annual sediment accretion rate is a function of inundation frequency and the mineral accumulation rates measured from 137Csdating of soil cores sampled across each site. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic constituents of a nearby NOAA tide gauge. This allowed a more accurate characterization of the full tidal regime as our water loggers were located above MLLW. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we assumed that inundation frequency was directly related to sediment mass accumulation; this simplifying assumption does not account for the potential feedback between biomass and sediment deposition and holds suspended sediment concentration and settling velocity constant. Sediment accretion, Ms,at a given elevation, z, is equal to, where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and Sis the annual sediment accumulation rate in g cm-2 y-1.Organic matterWe used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter (Morris et al. 2002), based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora. Given that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are dominated by other plant species, we developed site-specific, asymmetric unimodal relationships to characterize elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by MTL at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. The curves were truncated to zero below the lowest observed marsh elevation for each site from our vegetation surveys, reflecting the observed transition to unvegetated mudflat. The root-to-shoot ratio for each site was set to 1.95, the mean value from an inundation experiment conducted at Siletz in 2014 for Juncus balticusand Carex lyngbyei, two common high and low marsh species in the Pacific Northwest (C. Janousek et al., unpublished results). Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions of WARMER followed Callaway et al. (1996).

After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110).

The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are currently altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, and current and historic sediment accretion rates to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise affected marsh persistence. Under a low sea-level rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of marsh plant communities or gradually increased proportions of mid, high, or transition marsh vegetation zones. However at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of middle and high marsh and gain of low marsh habitat. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor, and Willapa) appeared to have the most resilience to a high sea-level rise rate, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites have resiliency to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most high and mid marsh habitats by 2110.", "casc": "Northwest CASC", "parentId": "5af4a8b3e4b0da30c1b44ecd", "contacts": [{"name": "Karen M Thorne", "type": "Point of Contact", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": "Ecologist (Landscape)"}, {"name": "Karen M Thorne", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "U.S. Geological Survey", "type": "Distributor", "email": "sciencebase@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "GS ScienceBase", "type": "Distributor", "email": "sciencebase@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "568c0f78e4b0e7594ee7779f": {"summary": "This code computes the analytical solution for the damping of sinusoidal infiltration in variably saturated soils described by Bakker and Neiber (2009) and implemented by Dickinson et al.

The effects of climate change may be particularly large in mountainous regions where climate can vary significantly with elevation. Understanding potential future vegetation changes in these regions requires methods that can resolve vegetation responses to climate change at fine spatial resolutions. This research was projected using three models: cgcm31, hadley, and current. We used LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, to assess potential future vegetation changes for a large topographically complex area of the northwest United States and southwest Canada (38.0\u201358.0\u00b0N latitude by 136.6\u2013103.0\u00b0W longitude). LPJ is a process-based vegetation model that mechanistically simulates the effect of changing climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetation. It was developed and has been mostly applied at spatial resolutions of 10-minutes or coarser. In this study, we used LPJ at a 30-second (~1-km) spatial resolution to simulate potential vegetation changes for 2070\u20132099. LPJ was run using downscaled future climate simulations from five coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (CCSM3, CGCM3.1(T47), GISS-ER, MIROC3.2(medres), UKMO-HadCM3) produced using the A2 greenhouse gases emissions scenario. Under projected future climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the simulated vegetation changes result in the contraction of alpine, shrub-steppe, and xeric shrub vegetation across the study area and the expansion of woodland and forest vegetation. Large areas of maritime cool forest and cold forest are simulated to persist under projected future conditions. The fine spatial-scale vegetation simulations resolve patterns of vegetation change that are not visible at coarser resolutions and these fine-scale patterns are particularly important for understanding potential future vegetation changes in topographically complex areas.", "title": "Projected future vegetation changes for the Northwest United States and Southwest Canada at a fine spatial resolution using a dynamic global vegetation model", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57476809e4b07e28b663d8f7", "proj_id": "5318ba1ae4b0ae6e9d5a3b7c", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57476809e4b07e28b663d8f7", "fy": "2014", "purpose": "The aim of this study was to simulate vegetation responses to climate change at a fine spatial resolution across our topographically complex study area that includes vegetation ranging from xeric vegetation in the interior western United States to mesic vegetation along the Pacific Coast.

Hierarchical modeling of urban growth across the conterminous USA: developing meso-scale quantity drivers for the Land Transformation Model. Journal of Land Use Science, 2012   The Land Transformation Model (LTM) is hierarchically coupled with meso-scale drivers to project urban growth across the conterminous USA. Quantity of urban growth 10 at county and place (i.e., city) scales is simulated using population, urban density and nearest neighbor dependent attributes. We compared three meso-scale LTMs to three null models that lack meso-scale drivers.

A recent survey of 80 managers of floodplain conservation lands along the Upper and Middle Mississippi and Lower Missouri Rivers in the central United States found that the most critical information needed to improve floodplain management centered on metrics for characterizing depth, extent, frequency, duration, and timing of inundation. These metrics can be delivered to managers efficiently through cloud-based interactive maps. To calculate these metrics, we interpolated an existing one-dimensional HEC-RAS hydraulic model for the Lower Missouri River, which simulated water surface elevations at cross sections spaced (&lt;1 kilometer) to sufficiently characterize water surface profiles along an approximately 800 kilometer stretch upstream from the confluence with the Mississippi River over an 80-year record at a daily time step. To translate these water surface elevations to inundation depths, we subtracted a merged terrain model consisting of floodplain LIDAR and bathymetric surveys of the river channel. We completed these calculations for an 800 kilometer stretch of the Missouri River, spanning from Rulo, Nebraska to the river's confluence with the Mississippi River. This approach resulted in a 29,000+ day time series of inundation depths across the floodplain using grid cells with 30 meter spatial resolution. This dataset presents 17 metrics for each of two scenarios, one using a baseline timeseries of stages from the HEC-RAS simulation and one using a timeseries of stages adjusted to account for changes in discharge under one possible climate change scenario. These metrics are calculated on a per pixel basis and encompass a variety of temporal criteria generally relevant to flora and fauna of interest to floodplain managers, including, for example, the average number of days inundated per year within a growing season. We also include a series of maps of water depths across the floodplain by return interval for each scenario, and the minimum return interval at which each pixel is inundated.

This GIS dataset is one of several climate connectivity analyses produced by Tristan Nu\u00f1ez for a Master's thesis (Nu\u00f1ez 2011). The dataset was produced in part to assist the Climate Change Subgroup of the Washington Wildlife Habitat Connectivity Working Group (WHCWG). The core areas in the map lie in Washington State and neighboring areas in British Columbia, Idaho, and Oregon.This connectivity analysis should be displayed in conjunction with vector layer of Landscape Integrity Core Areas developed by the WHCWG (WHCWG 2010).  This GIS dataset is part of a suite of wildlife habitat connectivity data produced by the Washington Wildlife Habitat Connectivity Working Group (WHCWG). The WHCWG is a voluntary public-private partnership between state and federal agencies, universities, tribes, and non-governmental organizations. The WHCWG is co-led by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and the Washington Department of Transportation (WSDOT).  This dataset quantifies current wildlife habitat connectivity patterns for the Columbia Plateau Ecoregion in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.  Available WHCWG raster data include model base layers, resistance, habitat, cost-weighted distance, and landscape integrity.  Grid cell size is 90 m x 90 m.

Over 2,000 intertidal plots were sampled for plant cover, frequency of occurrence, and species richness across the six study sites. Approximately 57 vascular plant species were found in the study, including grasses, rushes, forbs and sedges. Vegetated marsh ranged in elevation from approximately local mean tide level (MTL) to the marsh-upland transition zone (upland plots, defined as areas estimated to flood 1 time per year on average, were not considered for further analysis). We assessed vegetation cover and species richness concurrently with elevation surveys at approximately 25% of the elevation points. We visually assessed percent cover of all plant species within a 0.25 m2 quadrat, and recorded the average and maximum height (measured to the nearest centimeter) of each species. Total plant cover in a plot could exceed 100% due to vegetation layering. Vascular plant nomenclature generally follows Baldwin et al. (2012). We used long-term (10 yr) NOAA tide data to assess inundation relationships with local elevation and thereby define the elevation limits of four intertidal habitat zones for evaluation of SLR impacts to marshes along the California coastline: low marsh, middle marsh, high marsh and transitional marsh. First, to determine region-specific relationships between elevation and inundation, we compiled data from all recorded high tides from 2004-2013 at three NOAA tidal stations along the US west coast: San Diego, San Francisco, and Charleston, Oregon (tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). Using these time series, we determined the percentage of high tides that reached a given elevation. We defined low marsh as all elevations between the lowest vegetation plot and the elevation reached by 50% of all recorded high tides (low marsh flooded at least once daily, on average). We defined middle marsh as habitat flooded by 50-25% of all high tides (flooding once every 1-2 days, on average), and high marsh as elevations flooded by 3-25% of all high tides (flooding at least twice per month, but less than once every other day, on average). We defined transition zone marsh as habitat flooded by 0.14-3% of all high tides (flooding at least once annually, but no more than twice per month, on average). Mudflat occurred between local mean-lower low water (MLLW) and the lowest extent of emergent tidal marsh vegetation; subtidal habitat occurred.

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast. Our overarching questions were: (1) how do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries, and (2) does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast.", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "parentId": "594c3863e4b062508e385741", "contacts": [{"name": "USGS Western Ecological Research Center", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist"}, {"name": "Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research Center , Research Ecologist", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "52ebe44de4b0a0815e249ed5": {"summary": "This dataset is a shapefile that contains the grid outlines and identifiers for the tiles produced by the TopoWx (\"Topographical Weather/Climate\") temperature dataset as applied to the USGS North Central Climate Center Domain and the surrounding area of Montana.

The U.S. Northern Rockies still support a full suite of native wildlife, and survival of these populations depends on connected landscapes. Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action. We also encountered high levels of uncertainty in how climate change is expected to alter vegetation and how wildlife are expected to respond to these changes. This uncertainty limits the value of our assessment for informing proactive management of climate change impacts on both species-specific and biome-level connectivity (although biome-level assessments were subject to fewer sources of uncertainty).

The U.S. Northern Rockies still support a full suite of native wildlife, and survival of these populations depends on connected landscapes. Connected landscapes support current migration and dispersal as well as future shifts in species ranges that will be necessary for species to adapt to our changing climate. Working in partnership with state and federal resource managers and private land trusts, we sought to: 1) understand how future climate change may alter habitat composition of landscapes expected to serve as important connections for wildlife, 2) estimate how wildlife species of concern are expected to respond to these changes, 3) develop climate-smart strategies to help stakeholders manage public and private lands in ways that allow wildlife to continue to move in response to changing conditions, and 4) explore how well existing management plans and conservation efforts are expected to support crucial connections for wildlife under climate change. We assessed vulnerability of eight wildlife species and four biomes to climate change, with a focus on potential impacts to connectivity. Our assessment provides some insights about where these species and biomes may be most vulnerable or most resilient to loss of connectivity and how this information could support climate-smart management action. We also encountered high levels of uncertainty in how climate change is expected to alter vegetation and how wildlife are expected to respond to these changes. This uncertainty limits the value of our assessment for informing proactive management of climate change impacts on both species-specific and biome-level connectivity (although biome-level assessments were subject to fewer sources of uncertainty).

(1996), to examine the effects of three SLR projections on future habitat composition at each study site. Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates annual elevation changes relative to MSL based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter inputs, soil compaction, and organic matter decomposition for a representative marsh area. Cohort density, a function of soil mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and compaction of the soil column. The change in relative elevation is then calculated as the difference between the change in modeled sea level and the change in height of the soil column, which was estimated as the sum of the volume of all cohorts. In the model, the elevation of the marsh surface, E, at time t relative to local MSL is estimated asE(t)= E(0)- SLR(t)+ \u2211_(i=0)^t\u2592\u3016V_i (t)\u3017(Eq. 1) where E(0) is the initial elevation relative to MSL, SLR(t) is the sea-level at time t relative to the initial sea level and Vi(t) is the volume per unit area, or height, at time t, of the cohort formed during year i.We used WARMER to model decadal-scale changes in tidal wetland elevation at each site and summarized these data as changes in the spatial extent of the tidal marsh zones defined previously.Model inputs Sea-level rise scenarioIn WARMER, we used the National Research Council\u2019s (2012) forecast for the Pacific coast which projects low, mid, and high SLR scenarios of 44, 93 and 166 cm by 2110.

In the modeling exercises, we assumed that tide range remained constant through time, with only the position of MSL relative to land changing annually.Inorganic matterIn WARMER, the annual sediment deposition rate is a function of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC), inundation depth and duration, and settling velocity. For each site, we developed a continuous model of water level from the major harmonic tidal constituents at nearby NOAA tide gauges. This allowed a more accurate characterization of inundation duration across the full tidal regime since our water loggers were located in the intertidal. We then used a constant initial SSC (20 g L-1), settling velocity (0.001464 cm s-1, Schile et al., 2014), and horizontal flow rate (0.2 cm s-1) to calculate the mass of annual sediment deposition across all intertidal elevations. The deposition model follows Marani et al. (2010) who used a mass balance equation for sediment in the water column. The model assumes initial SSC is constant during flood tides but decreases as a function of the deposition rate on ebb tides. We then used a logistic function to characterize annual deposition rates across a range of elevations. Finally, we calibrated the amplitude of the logistic function to the sediment accumulation rates from the soil cores, which were sampled across an elevation gradient at each study site. This method allowed us to estimate an annual accumulation rate (g cm-1 yr-1) for each of our study sites.Organic matterOverall we used a unimodal functional shape to describe the relationship between elevation and organic matter inputs to new soils, based on Atlantic coast work on Spartina alterniflora (Morris et al., 2002) and developed site-specific, asymmetric elevation-productivity relationships. We used Bezier curves to draw a unimodal parabola, anchored on the low elevation by the minimum elevation of vegetation from our surveys and at the high elevation by the maximum observed water level from a nearby NOAA tide gauge. We determined the elevation of peak productivity by analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)) from 2011 NAIP imagery (4 spectral bands, 1 m resolution; Tucker, 1979) and our interpolated DEM. We then calibrated the amplitude of the unimodal function to the organic matter input rates (determined from sediment accumulation rates and the percent organic matter in the surface layer of the core) obtained from sediment cores across an elevation range at each site. To partition organic matter inputs between above and below ground fractions, we used a constant root-to-shoot ratio for organic matter production, determined from preliminary experimental data on flooding impacts to Sarcocornia pacifica growth in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Janousek et al., unpublished data). The mass of organic material generated below ground each year was distributed exponentially with depth and we set the coefficient of exponential decay, kdist, equal to 1.0 (Deverel et al., 2008).Compaction and decompositionCompaction and decomposition functions in the WARMER model followed Callaway et al. (1996). We determined sediment compaction using the difference in measured porosity between the top 5 cm and the bottom 5 cm of each sediment core. We estimated the rate of decrease, r, in porosity of a given cohort as a function of the density of all of the material above that cohort:r=1-p_b/(k_1-p_b ) (Eq. 4)where pb is the density of the material above a cohort and k1 was a calibration constant. Following Swanson et al. (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-stage process where the youngest organic material (less than one year old) decomposed at the fastest rate, organic matter one to two years old decayed at a moderate rate, and organic matter greater than two years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the compaction and decomposition functions from Deverel et al. (2008). Model parameters are provided in a table for each site. ImplementationFor each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD88). A two hundred year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea-level rose according to the scenario (Humboldt: +12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110; All other sites: +44, 93, or 166 cm by 2110). Linear interpolation was used to project model results every 10 years onto the continuous DEM developed from the RTK surveys.

Our CERCC network is a research model that can be potentially transferred to other coastal regions throughout the US. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regionally-applicable climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast.

We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: (1) measure topographical and ecological characteristics (e.g., elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, (2) model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and (3) examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the California coast", "casc": "Southwest CASC", "parentId": "56e746c0e4b0f59b85d5b1c4", "contacts": [{"name": "USGS Western Ecological Research Center", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist"}, {"name": "Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research Center , Research Ecologist", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}, {"name": "Karen Thorne, USGS Western Ecological Research Center , Research Ecologist", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "orcId": "", "jobTitle": ""}]}, "5a78a359e4b00f54eb1e83e9": {"summary": "The threshold raster includes the raw streamflow permanence probability value at a given pixel that represents the estimated critical value to differentiate between wet conditions (above the threshold) and dry conditions (below the threshold).

Recent declines in walleye and increases in largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and appropriate management actions for these important species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, USA under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment success and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 30-70% of lakes, and an increase to high largemouth bass relative abundance in 17-55% of additional lakes. The percentage of lakes with abundant largemouth bass and failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 59% in contemporary conditions to 86% of lakes by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the number of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 8.5% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 38 1% of lakes in both future periods.

Management actions may have a higher probability of being successful if they are informed by available scientific knowledge and findings; a systematic review process provides a mechanism to scientifically assess management questions. By evaluating specific actions on scientific knowledge and findings, we may be able to increase management effectiveness and efficiency. The goal of the Available Science Assessment Project (ASAP) is to synthesize and evaluate the body of scientific knowledge on specific, on-the-ground CAAs to determine the conditions, timeframes, and geographic areas where particular CAAs may be most effective for resource managers. We have derived a methodology that utilizes interviews, a systematic review process, and extensive engagement with natural resource managers and scientists throughout the Northwest Climate Science Center (NW CSC) region.

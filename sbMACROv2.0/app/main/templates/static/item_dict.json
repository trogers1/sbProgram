Some climate models predict an additional warming of up 2 to 4 \u25e6 C over the next 100 years for the primary breeding grounds for North American ducks. Such an increase has been predicted to reduce mid - continent breeding duck populations by &gt;70%. Managing continental duck populations in the face of climate change requires understanding how waterfowl have responded to historical spatio - temporal climatic variation. However, such responses to climate may be obscured by how ducks respond to variation in land cover. We estimated effects of climate on settlement patterns of breeding ducks in the Prairie - Parkland Region (PPR), boreal forest, and tundra accounting for potential confounding effects of variation in major land cover types. In the process, we address several hypotheses regarding how breeding ducks respond to environmental variation. Specifically, we modeled 1958 - 2012 species occupancy by relating Waterfowl Breeding Populatio n and Habitat Survey detection \u2013 non - detection data to annual winter temperature, winter precipitation, crop acreage, pond abundance and forest fires using multi - season occupancy models. We compare resulting estimated relationships between colonization and extinction and environmental covariates to predictions of our hypotheses.  Best models of annual extinction and colonization probabilities were almost invariably among the most complex in our model sets, suggesting all variables influenced duck settlement patterns across space and time. Climate and fire were important in the boreal forest. Climate, ponds, and cropland were important in the Canada PPR and Dakotas; climate variables were less important in Montana. Our results suggest that climatic warming could result in a shift of breeding duck distributions northward, reducing occupancy of breeding ducks in 3 the prairies and increasing occupancy of breeding ducks in the boreal forest. Models were difficult to construct for the tundra because of sparse data , although some models, together with na\u00efve occupancy data, suggest several species have become more widespread in the Arctic over time. More extensive monitoring of waterfowl in the Arctic may be prudent.

These changes, along with thawing of previously frozen organic material, can alter the form and magnitude of greenhouse gas production from permafrost ecosystems. We synthesized existing methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) production measurements from anaerobic incubations of boreal and tundra soils from the geographic permafrost region to evaluate large-scale controls of anaerobic CO 2 and CH 4 production and compare the relative importance of landscape-level factors (e.g., vegetation type and landscape position), soil properties (e.g., pH, depth, and soil type), and soil environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and relative water table position). We found fivefold higher maximum CH 4 production per gram soil carbon from organic soils than mineral soils. Maximum CH 4 production from soils in the active layer (ground that thaws and refreezes annually) was nearly four times that of permafrost per gram soil carbon, and CH 4 production per gram soil carbon was two times greater from sites without permafrost than sites with permafrost. Maximum CH 4 and median anaerobic CO 2 production decreased with depth, while CO 2:CH 4 production increased with depth. Maximum CH 4 production was highest in soils with herbaceous vegetation and soils that were either consistently or periodically inundated. This synthesis identifies the need to consider biome, landscape position, and vascular/moss vegetation types when modeling CH 4 production in permafrost ecosystems and suggests the need for longer-term anaerobic incubations to fully capture CH 4 dynamics.

Molecular approaches have recently revealed the identities and functional gene composition of microorganisms in some permafrost soils2, 3, 4 and a rapid shift in functional gene composition during short-term thaw experiments3.

To better understand these dynamics, we established three sites in Alaska that vary in permafrost regime, including a black spruce peat plateau forest with stable permafrost, an internal collapse scar bog formed as a result of thermokarst, and a rich fen without permafrost. Measurements include year-round eddy covariance estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2 ), water, and energy fluxes, associated environmental variables, and methane (CH4 ) fluxes at the collapse scar bog. The ecosystems all acted as net sinks of CO2  in 2011 and 2012, when air temperature and precipitation remained near long-term means. In 2013, under a late snowmelt and late leaf out followed by a hot, dry summer, the permafrost forest and collapse scar bog were sources of CO2 . In this same year, CO2  uptake in the fen increased, largely because summer inundation from groundwater inputs suppressed ecosystem respiration. CO2  exchange in the permafrost forest and collapse scar bog was sensitive to warm air temperatures, with 0.5 g C m-2  lost each day when maximum air temperature was very warm (\u226529\u00b0C). The bog lost 4981 \u00b1 300 mg CH4  m-2  between April and September 2013, indicating that this ecosystem acted as a significant source of both CO2  and CH4  to the atmosphere in 2013.

In this study, we used porewater stable isotopes collected from both the edge and center of a thermokarst bog in Interior Alaska to estimate in situ microbial reaction rates. We expected that near the edge of the thaw feature, actively thawing permafrost and greater abundance of sedges would increase carbon, oxygen and nutrient availability, enabling faster microbial rates relative to the center of the thaw feature. We developed three different conceptual reaction networks that explained the temporal change in porewater CO2, CH4,  \u03b4 13C\u2013CO2 and  \u03b4 13C\u2013CH4. All three reaction-network models included methane production, methane oxidation and CO2 production, and two of the models included homoacetogenesis\u2014a reaction not previously included in isotope-based porewater models. All three models fit the data equally well, but rates resulting from the models differed. Most notably, inclusion of homoacetogenesis altered the modeled pathways of methane production when the reaction was directly coupled to methanogenesis, and it decreased gross methane production rates by up to a factor of five when it remained decoupled from methanogenesis. The ability of all three conceptual reaction networks to successfully match the measured data indicate that this technique for estimating in situ reaction rates requires other data and information from the site to confirm the considered set of microbial reactions. Despite these differences, all models indicated that, as expected, rates were greater at the edge than in the center of the thaw bog, that rates at the edge increased more during the growing season than did rates in the center, and that the ratio of acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was greater at the edge than in the center. In both locations, modeled rates (excluding methane oxidation) increased with depth. A puzzling outcome from the effort was that none of the models could fit the porewater dataset without generating \u201cfugitive\u201d carbon (i.e., methane or acetate generated by the models but not detected at the field site), indicating that either our conceptualization of the reactions occurring at the site remains incomplete or our site measurements are missing important carbon transformations and/or carbon fluxes.

This study concentrates on two years, 2007 and 1996, with different arctic sea ice conditions and tundra fire activity. The year of 2007 is characterized by a low summer sea ice extent (second lowest) and high tundra fire activity, while 1996 had high sea ice extent, and few tundra fires. Atmospheric lateral boundary forcing from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis drove the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, along with varying sea ice surface forcing designed to delineate the role of sea ice. WRF runs successfully reproduced the differences between 1996 and 2007. Surprisingly, replacing sea ice conditions in 1996 run by those from 2007 and vice versa (2007 run with 1996 sea ice) did not change the overall picture. The atmospheric circulation in August of 1996 included a significant low-pressure system over the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. However, in 2007, a high-pressure system dominated the circulation over the Beaufort Sea.

Here we describe the construction and evaluation of 771-m-resolution gridded historical and statistically downscaled projections of snow/rain partitioning for the state of Alaska at decadal temporal resolution. The method developed here uses observational data to describe the relationship between average monthly temperature and the fraction of wet days in that month receiving snow, the snow-day fraction. Regionally and seasonally specific equations were developed to accommodate variability in synoptic scale climatology of rain and snow events. These equations were then applied to gridded decadal temperature data and projections. The gridded products provide a reasonable characterization of snow-day fraction throughout the state. However, there are local deviations from the regional relationships, particularly in the topographically complex areas ringing the Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet. When applied to questions about changing precipitation regimes in northern, western and south-eastern Alaska, these data demonstrate the potential for marked changes from snow-dominated to mixed precipitation regimes and also exhibit a wide range of potential future conditions.

Across the Pan-Arctic, vegetation productivity and surface greenness have trended positively over the period of satellite observation.

It is unclear what factors are driving this change and which regions/landforms will be most sensitive to future browning. Here we provide evidence linking decadal patterns in arctic greening and browning with regional climate change and local permafrost-driven landscape heterogeneity. We analyzed the spatial variability of decadal-scale trends in surface greenness across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska (~60,000\u2009km\u00b2) using the Landsat archive (1999\u20132014), in combination with novel 30\u2009m classifications of polygonal tundra and regional watersheds, finding landscape heterogeneity and regional climate change to be the most important factors controlling historical greenness trends. Browning was linked to increased temperature and precipitation, with the exception of young landforms (developed following lake drainage), which will likely continue to green.

Differences in net CO2 fluxes derived from open- and closed-path IRGAs in general remain poorly constrained. In particular, the performance of the IRGASON and the EC150 for measuring Fc_OP has not been characterized yet. These IRGAs measure CO2 absorption, which is scaled with air temperature and pressure before converting it to instantaneous CO2 density. This sensor-internal conversion is based on a slow-response thermistor air temperature measurement. Here, we test if the high-frequency temperature attenuation causes selectively systematic Fc_OP errors that scale with kinematic temperature fluxes. First, we examine the relationship between wintertime Fc_OP and kinematic temperature fluxes for eight northern ecosystems. Second, we investigate how residuals between Fc_OP and CO2 fluxes from co-located closed-path IRGAs (FC_CP) are related to kinematic temperature fluxes for three different ecosystem types (i.e., boreal forest, grassland, and irrigated cropland). We find that kinematic temperature fluxes, but not mean ambient air temperatures or CO2 flux regime, consistently determine the absolute magnitude ofFc_OP errors. This selectively systematic bias causes the most pronounced relative Fc_OPerrors to occur when \u201ctrue\u201d CO2 fluxes are low and kinematic temperature fluxes are high (e.g., northern ecosystems during the winter). The smallest relative errors occur during periods with large \u201ctrue\u201d CO2 fluxes and low kinematic temperature fluxes. To address this bias, we replace the slow-response air temperature in the absorption-to-CO2 density conversion with a fast-response air temperature derived from sonic anemometer measurements. The use of the fast-response air temperature improves the agreement between half-hourly Fc_OP and FC_CP for all open- versus closed-path IRGA comparisons. Additionally, cumulative Fc_OP and Fc_CP sums are more comparable as differences drop from 63 %\u201313 % to 20 %\u20138 %.

While many aspects of the North American carbon budget have been intensively studied, the net contribution of fire disturbance to the overall net carbon flux at the continental scale remains uncertain. Based on national scale, spatially explicit and long-term fire data, along with the improved model parameterization in a process-based ecosystem model, we simulated the impact of fire disturbance on both direct carbon emissions and net terrestrial ecosystem carbon balance in North America. Fire-caused direct carbon emissions were 106.55 \u00b1 15.98 Tg C/yr during 1990\u20132012; however, the net ecosystem carbon balance associated with fire was \u221226.09 \u00b1 5.22 Tg C/yr, indicating that most of the emitted carbon was resequestered by the terrestrial ecosystem. Direct carbon emissions showed an increase in Alaska and Canada during 1990\u20132012 as compared to prior periods due to more extreme fire events, resulting in a large carbon source from these two regions. Among biomes, the largest carbon source was found to be from the boreal forest, primarily due to large reductions in soil organic matter during, and with slower recovery after, fire events. The interactions between fire and environmental factors reduced the fire-caused ecosystem carbon source.

In nearby tundra regions, studies have identified a rapid increase in thermokarst formation (i.e., pits) over recent decades in response to climate warming, facilitating changes in polygonal tundra geomorphology. We assessed the future impact of 100 years of tundra geomorphic change on peak growing season carbon exchange in response to: (i) landscape succession associated with the thaw-lake cycle; and (ii) low, moderate, and extreme scenarios of thermokarst pit formation (10%, 30%, and 50%) reported for Alaskan arctic tundra sites.

We present growing season soil chamber methane emission (FCH4), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary production (GPP) fluxes from a 9-years water table manipulation experiment in an Alaskan rich fen. The study included major flood and drought years, where wetting and drying treatments further modified the severity of droughts. Results support previous findings from peatlands that drought causes reduced magnitude of growing season FCH4, GPP and NEE, thus reducing or reversing their C sink function. Experimentally exacerbated droughts further reduced the capacity for the fen to act as a C sink by causing shifts in vegetation and thus reducing magnitude of maximum growing season GPP in subsequent flood years by ~15% compared to control plots. Conversely, water table position had only a weak influence on ER, but dominant contribution to ER switched from autotrophic respiration in wet years to heterotrophic in dry years. Droughts did not cause inter-annual lag effects on ER in this rich fen, as has been observed in several nutrient-poor peatlands. While ER was dependent on soil temperatures at 2 cm depth, FCH4 was linked to soil temperatures at 25 cm. Inter-annual variability of deep soil temperatures was in turn dependent on wetness rather than air temperature, and higher FCH4 in flooded years was thus equally due to increased methane production at depth and decreased methane oxidation near the surface. Short-term fluctuations in wetness caused significant lag effects on FCH4, but droughts caused no inter-annual lag effects on FCH4. Our results show that frequency and severity of droughts and floods can have characteristic effects on the exchange of greenhouse gases, and emphasize the need to project future hydrological regimes in rich fens.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59304d13e4b0e9bd0ea8ea86", "parentId": "503fab88e4b09851b69ab40c", "proj_id": "503faaa3e4b09851b69ab403", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=59304d13e4b0e9bd0ea8ea86"}, "5841f304e4b04fc80e518d56": {"title": "Final Report:  Integrated Ecosystem Model for Alaska and Northwest Canada Project", "contacts": [{"name": "Anthony D McGuire", "type": "Author", "email": "ffadm@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Assistant Unit Leader Ecology", "orcId": "0000-0003-4646-0750"}, {"name": "T.

Thermokarst has affected the lowlands of the Tanana Flats in central Alaska for centuries, as thawing permafrost collapses forests that transition to wetlands. Located within the discontinuous permafrost zone, this region has significantly warmed over the past half-century, and much of these carbon-rich permafrost soils are now within ~0.5 \u00b0C of thawing. Increased permafrost thaw in lowland boreal forests in response to warming may have consequences for the climate system. This study evaluates the trajectories and potential drivers of 60 years of forest change in a landscape subjected to permafrost thaw in unburned dominant forest types (paper birch and black spruce) associated with location on elevated permafrost plateau and across multiple time periods (1949, 1978, 1986, 1998, and 2009) using historical and contemporary aerial and satellite images for change detection. We developed (i) a deterministic statistical model to evaluate the potential climatic controls on forest change using gradient boosting and regression tree analysis, and (ii) a 30 \u00d7 30 m land cover map of the Tanana Flats to estimate the potential landscape-level losses of forest area due to thermokarst from 1949 to 2009. Over the 60-year period, we observed a nonlinear loss of birch forests and a relatively continuous gain of spruce forest associated with thermokarst and forest succession, while gradient boosting/regression tree models identify precipitation and forest fragmentation as the primary factors controlling birch and spruce forest change, respectively. Between 1950 and 2009, landscape-level analysis estimates a transition of ~15 km\u00b2 or ~7% of birch forests to wetlands, where the greatest change followed warm periods.

The RGI was created with limited resources in a short period. Priority was given to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is attached to each of the ~198 000 glaciers in its latest version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999\u20132010 provided most of the outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800 +/- 34 000 km2. The uncertainty, about +/- 5%, is derived from careful single-glacier and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories that were not sources for the RGI.  The main contributors to uncertainty are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover. These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models, the RGI glacier outlines yield hyposemetries that can be combined with atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of climatic change on glaciers.

Future DO depletion events in small, coastal salmon streams are therefore likely to be driven by changes in hydrology in addition to atmospheric warming. We measured DO, temperature, discharge and spawning salmon abundance in upstream (reference reach) and downstream salmon bearing reaches of four streams in southeast Alaska to determine how multiple physical and biotic factors interact to control streamwater DO. Stream temperature ranged from 5.1 to 15.8 \u00b0C and fell within the optimum range that is considered favorable for salmon physiology. Concentrations of DO ranged from 2.8 to 12.3 mg/L, with concentrations significantly lower (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01) in the downstream compared to upstream sites when spawning salmon were present. These findings likely indicate that spawning salmon can substantially alter ecosystem respiration and thus DO regimes in stream ecosystems. Furthermore, DO concentrations in lower Peterson Creek were especially low (&lt;\u20094.0 mg/L) in early August when stream temperature exceeded 14 \u00b0C, discharge was low and spawning salmon were abundant. These results illustrate that the impacts of enhanced ecosystem respiration due to high densities of spawning salmon, elevated stream temperature and reduced aeration stemming from low streamflow are likely additive in terms of reducing DO. Furthermore, it is highly likely that stray salmon released from local hatcheries augmented spawner densities in our study streams.

These equations express discharge as a function of basin physical characteristics such as area, mean elevation, and land cover, and of basin meteorological characteristics such as temperature, precipitation, and accumulated water year precipitation. To provide the necessary input meteorological data, temperature and precipitation data for a 40 year hind-cast period were developed on high-spatial-resolution grids using weather station data, PRISM climatologies, and statistical downscaling methods. Runoff predictions from the equations were found to agree well with observations. Once developed, the regression equations were applied to a network of delineated watersheds spanning the entire GOA drainage basin. The region was divided into a northern region, ranging from the Aleutian Chain to the Alaska/Canada border in the southeast panhandle, and a southern region, ranging from there to the Fraser River. The mean annual runoff volume into the northern GOA region was found to be 792 \u00b1 120 km3 yr\u22121. A water balance using MODIS-based evapotranspiration rates yielded seasonal storage volumes that were consistent with GRACE satellite-based estimates.

However, DO in Peterson Creek was mildly related to stream temperature (R2=0.15, P&lt;0.01) and strongly influenced by discharge (R2=0.46, P&lt;0.01) on days when stream temperature exceeded 10\u00b0C. Moreover, Peterson Creek had DO values that were particularly low (&lt;5.0 mg L\u22121) on days when discharge was low but also when spawning salmon were abundant.

Abstract from paper:  Iceberg calving is known to release substantial seismic energy, but little is known about the specific mechanisms that produce calving icequakes. At Yahtse Glacier, a tidewater  glacier on the Gulf of Alaska, we draw upon a local network of seismometers and focus on  80 hours of concurrent, direct observation of the terminus to show that calving is the  dominant source of seismicity. To elucidate seismogenic mechanisms, we synchronized  video and seismograms to reveal that the majority of seismic energy is produced during  iceberg interactions with the sea surface. Icequake peak amplitudes coincide with the  emergence of high velocity jets of water and ice from the fjord after the complete  submergence of falling icebergs below sea level. These icequakes have dominant  frequencies between 1 and 3 Hz. Detachment of an iceberg from the terminus produces  comparatively weak seismic waves at frequencies between 5 and 20 Hz. Our observations  allow us to suggest that the most powerful sources of calving icequakes at Yahtse Glacier  include iceberg-sea surface impact, deceleration under the influence of drag and buoyancy,  and cavitation. Numerical simulations of seismogenesis during iceberg-sea surface  interactions support our observational evidence. Our new understanding of iceberg-sea  surface interactions allows us to reattribute the sources of calving seismicity identified in  earlier studies and offer guidance for the future use of seismology in monitoring iceberg  calving.

We analyzed streamwater for \u03b418O and dissolved organic matter (DOM) biogeochemistry (concentration, \u03b413C-dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and fluorescence characterization) during the 2012 glacial runoff season from three coastal watersheds in southeast Alaska that ranged in glacier coverage from 0 to 49% and a glacier outflow stream. Our goal was to assess how DOM biogeochemistry may change as receding glaciers are replaced by forests and glaciers contribute less meltwater to streamflow. Discharge and streamwater \u03b418O varied seasonally reflecting varying contributions of rainfall and snow/icemelt to streamflow over the runoff season. Mean DOC concentrations were lowest in the glacial outflow and highest in the non-glacial stream reflecting an increasing contribution of vascular plant-derived carbon with decreasing watershed glaciation. Fluorescence and \u03b413C-DOC signatures indicated that DOM shifted from vascular plant-derived, humic-like material in the non-glacial stream toward more \u03b413C-DOC enriched, glacier-derived DOM in the glacial outflow. Streamwater \u03b418O was significantly correlated to DOC concentration, \u03b413C-DOC, and protein-like fluorescence of streamwater DOM (all P &lt; 0.05), demonstrating that changes in the source of streamwater across the glacial watershed continuum have important implications for the amount and quality of stream DOM export.

Our goal was to determine how air temperature and watershed land cover, particularly glacier coverage, influence stream temperature across the seasonal glacial meltwater hydrograph. Multiple linear regression models identified mean watershed elevation (related to glacier extent) and watershed lake coverage (%) as the strongest landscape controls on mean monthly stream temperature, with the weakest (May) and strongest (July) models explaining 86% and 97% of the temperature variability, respectively. Mean weekly stream temperature was significantly correlated with mean weekly air temperature in seven streams; however, the relationships were weak to non-significant in the streams influenced by glacial run-off. Streams with &gt;30% glacier coverage showed decreasing stream temperatures with rising summer air temperatures, whereas those with &lt;30% glacier coverage exhibited summertime warming. Glaciers also had a cooling effect on monthly mean stream temperature during the summer (July through September) equivalent to a decrease of 1.1 \u00b0C for each 10% increase in glacier coverage. The maximum weekly average temperature (an index of thermal suitability for salmon) in the six glacial streams was substantially below the lower threshold for optimum salmon growth. This finding suggests that although glaciers are important for moderating summer stream temperatures, future reductions in glacier run-off may actually improve the thermal suitability of some glacially dominated streams in Southeast Alaska for salmon.

Factors controlling the rapid and nonlinear variations in calving fluxes are poorly understood, and therefore difficult to include in prognostic climate-forced land-ice models. Here we analyse globally distributed calving data sets from Svalbard, Alaska (USA), Greenland and Antarctica in combination with simulations from a first-principles, particle-based numerical calving model to investigate the size and inter-event time of calving events. We find that calving events triggered by the brittle fracture of glacier ice are governed by the same power-law distributions as avalanches in the canonical Abelian sandpile model. This similarity suggests that calving termini behave as self-organized critical systems that readily flip between states of sub-critical advance and super-critical retreat in response to changes in climate and geometric conditions. Observations of sudden ice-shelf collapse and tidewater glacier retreat in response to gradual warming of their environment are consistent with a system fluctuating around its critical point in response to changing external forcing. We propose that self-organized criticality provides a yet unexplored framework for investigations into calving and projections of sea level rise.

We estimate total glacier runoff via summer mass balance and quantify the fraction of runoff related to annual mass imbalances.

In response to these forcings, the regional equilibrium line altitude (ELA) may increase by +105 to +225\u2009m by 2100. The mass balance sensitivity to this increase is highly variable, with the most substantive impact for glaciers with either limited elevation ranges (often small (&lt;1\u2009km2) glaciers, which account for 80% of glaciers in the region) or those with top-heavy geometries, like icefields. For more than 20% of glaciers, future ELAs, given RCP 6.0 forcings, will exceed the maximum elevation of the glacier, resulting in their eventual demise, while for others, accumulation area ratios will decrease by &gt;60%. Our results highlight the first-order control of hypsometry on individual glacier response to climate change, and the variability that hypsometry introduces to a regional response to a coherent climate perturbation.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58d98d2ce4b0543bf7fc64a6", "parentId": "55159a69e4b03238427817c2", "proj_id": "55130d9ee4b02e76d75c0778", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=58d98d2ce4b0543bf7fc64a6"}, "5c5204ede4b0708288fb42e5": {"title": "Interannual snow accumulation variability on glaciers derived from repeat, spatially extensive ground-penetrating radar surveys", "contacts": [{"name": "McGrath, Daniel", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Sass, Louis", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "O'Neel, Shad", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "McNeil, Chris", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Candela, Salvatore G.", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Baker, Emily H.", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Marshall, Hans-Peter", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Alaska CASC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Alaska CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "Abstract (from The Cryosphere): There is significant uncertainty regarding the spatiotemporal distribution of seasonal snow on glaciers, despite being a fundamental component of glacier mass balance. To address this knowledge gap, we collected repeat, spatially extensive high-frequency ground-penetrating radar (GPR) observations on two glaciers in Alaska during the spring of 5 consecutive years. GPR measurements showed steep snow water equivalent (SWE) elevation gradients at both sites; continental Gulkana Glacier's SWE gradient averaged 115\u2009mm 100\u2009m\u22121 and maritime Wolverine Glacier's gradient averaged 440\u2009mm 100\u2009m\u22121 (over &gt;\u20091000\u2009m). We extrapolated GPR point observations across the glacier surface using terrain parameters derived from digital elevation models as predictor variables in two statistical models (stepwise multivariable linear regression and regression trees). Elevation and proxies for wind redistribution had the greatest explanatory power, and exhibited relatively time-constant coefficients over the study period. Both statistical models yielded comparable estimates of glacier-wide average SWE (1\u2009% average difference at Gulkana, 4\u2009% average difference at Wolverine), although the spatial distributions produced by the models diverged in unsampled regions of the glacier, particularly at Wolverine. In total, six different methods for estimating the glacier-wide winter balance average agreed within \u00b111\u2009%. We assessed interannual variability in the spatial pattern of snow accumulation predicted by the statistical models using two quantitative metrics. Both glaciers exhibited a high degree of temporal stability, with \u223c85\u2009% of the glacier area experiencing less than 25\u2009% normalized absolute variability over this 5-year interval. We found SWE at a sparse network (3 stakes per glacier) of long-term glaciological stake sites to be highly correlated with the GPR-derived glacier-wide average. We estimate that interannual variability in the spatial pattern of winter SWE accumulation is only a small component (4\u2009%\u201310\u2009% of glacier-wide average) of the total mass balance uncertainty and thus, our findings support the concept that sparse stake networks effectively measure interannual variability in winter balance on glaciers, rather than some temporally varying spatial pattern of snow accumulation.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c5204ede4b0708288fb42e5", "parentId": "55159a69e4b03238427817c2", "proj_id": "55130d9ee4b02e76d75c0778", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5c5204ede4b0708288fb42e5"}, "5692e960e4b09c7f9a21a2a9": {"title": "Seasonal flows of international British Columbia-Alaska rivers: The nonlinear influence of ocean-atmosphere circulation patterns", "contacts": [{"name": "Sean W.

Rivers crossing the northern PCTR, which is also an international boundary region between British Columbia, Canada and Alaska, USA, deliver large freshwater and biogeochemical fluxes to the Gulf of Alaska and establish linkages between coastal and continental ecosystems. We evaluate interannual flow variability in three transboundary PCTR watersheds in response to El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). Historical hydroclimatic datasets from both Canada and the USA are analyzed using an up-to-date methodological suite accommodating both seasonally transient and highly nonlinear teleconnections. We find that streamflow teleconnections occur over particular seasonal windows reflecting the intersection of specific atmospheric and terrestrial hydrologic processes. The strongest signal is a snowmelt-driven flow timing shift resulting from ENSO- and PDO-associated temperature anomalies. Autumn rainfall runoff is also modulated by these climate modes, and a glacier-mediated teleconnection contributes to a late-summer ENSO-flow association. Teleconnections between AO and freshet flows reflect corresponding temperature and precipitation anomalies. A coherent NPGO signal is not clearly evident in streamflow. Linear and monotonically nonlinear teleconnections were widely identified, with less evidence for the parabolic effects that can play an important role elsewhere. The streamflow teleconnections did not vary greatly between hydrometric stations, presumably reflecting broad similarities in watershed characteristics.

Hydrologic processes during the period 1980\u20132014 were modeled using a suite of physically based, spatially distributed weather, energy-balance snow/ice melt, soil water balance, and runoff routing models at a high-resolution (1 km horizontal grid; daily time step).

However, only CFSR produced regional seasonal and long-term trends in water balance that compared favorably with independent Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and airborne altimetry data. Mean annual runoff using CFSR was 760 km3 yr\u22121, 8% of which was derived from the long-term removal of stored water from glaciers (glacier volume loss).

Strong correlations were found between FDOM and UTHg concentrations in the wetland, temperate forest watershed (r2 = 0.81), while turbidity and UTHg were highly correlated in the glacially dominated watershed (r2 = 0.82). Both of these parameters (FDOM and turbidity) showed stronger correlations than concentration-discharge relationships for UTHg (r2 = 0.55 for glacial stream, r2 = 0.38 for wetland/forest stream), thus allowing for a more precise determination of temporal variability in UTHg concentrations and fluxes. The association of mercury with particles and dissolved organic matter (DOM) appears to depend on the watershed characteristics, such as physical weathering and biogeochemical processes regulating mercury transport. Thus employing watershed-specific proxies for UTHg (such as FDOM and turbidity) can be effective for quantifying mercury export from watersheds with variable landcover. The UTHg concentration in the forest/wetland stream was consistently higher than in the glacial stream, in which most of the mercury was associated with particles; however, due to the high specific discharge from the glacial stream during the melt season, the watershed area normalized flux of mercury from the glacial stream was 3\u20136 times greater than the wetland/forest stream for the three sampling campaigns.

However, robust SWE estimates are observationally challenging, in part because SWE can vary abruptly over short distances in complex terrain due to interactions between topography and meteorological processes. In spring 2013, we measured snow accumulation on several glaciers around the Gulf of Alaska using both ground- and helicopter-based ground-penetrating radar surveys, complemented by extensive ground truth observations. We found that SWE can be highly variable (40% difference) over short spatial scales (tens to hundreds of meters), especially in the ablation zone where the underlying ice surfaces are typically rough. Elevation provides the dominant basin-scale influence on SWE, with gradients ranging from 115 to 400 mm/100 m. Regionally, total accumulation and the accumulation gradient are strongly controlled by a glacier's distance from the coastal moisture source. Multiple linear regressions, used to calculate distributed SWE fields, show that robust results require adequate sampling of the true distribution of multiple terrain parameters. Final SWE estimates (comparable to winter balances) show reasonable agreement with both the Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model climate data set (9\u201336% difference) and the U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Benchmark Glaciers (6\u201336% difference). All the glaciers in our study exhibit substantial sensitivity to changing snow-rain fractions, regardless of their location in a coastal or continental climate.

Unit contour length is equal to the DEM resolution of 50 meters.   **There are two versions of both the CTI and SCA provided:**  *CTI_AKPCTR_NoFlowMask.tif and SCA_AKPCTR_NoFlowMask.tif* This is the resulting CTI file when no masks are applied to the study area before the CTI procedure is run. After the CTI procedure is run, all glacial areas are masked out, as CTI is not meaningful over glaciers.  *CTI_AKPCTR_FlowMask.tif and SCA_AKPCTR_FlowMask.tif* This is the resulting CTI file where prior to running the CTI procedure, we apply a mask across all active glaciers and all downslope cells receiving flow from glacially affected cells. These masked cells are excluded from the CTI procedure. This results in fewer CTI values on the landscape. This dataset is provided to identify cells in the direct downslope path of glaciers because CTI values for cells receiving upslope accumulation from glaciers may not be reliable due to uncertainties in surface water flowpaths in glaciated areas.  **Processing Steps:** 1. Using the pitremove function from [TAUDEM](http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/index.html), filled sinks in the DEM following the method of Planchon and Darboux (2001).  2. (For **_FlowMask* versions only) Mask out glacial areas and associated downslope cells. Prior to calculating flow direction and flow accumulation, change cells in the filled DEM to NoData where glaciers exist, using the [Randolph Glacier Inventory version 5.0](https://www.glims.org/RGI/rgi50_dl.html) raster dataset to identify the presence of glaciers. Cells downslope from the masked glaciers will then also be identified as NoData in subsequent processing and the final CTI raster. Compute D-infinity slopes and flow direction and flow accumulation (as specific catchment area) rasters from the filled DEM using TAUDEM D-infinity method. As part of the D-infinity routine, TauDEM uses the method of Garbrecht &amp; Martz (1997) to resolve flats.  3. The D-infinity slope raster was modified in the following way: if slope = 0, then change slope value to 0.0001; otherwise leave slope value unchanged. This was done to avoid dividing by zero when calculating CTI.  4. Compute Compound Topographic Index (CTI) using these steps: Dsca = D-infinity specific catchment area raster Dslp = D-infinity slope raster Then, CTI = Ln(Dsca/Dslp)  5.

Horizontal datum=NAD83; vertical datum=CGVD28; projection=BC Albers; map units=meters; elevation units=meters.  3) The 0.75-arc-second, 1:50,000 [Canadian Digital Elevation Data (CDED)](ftp://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/geobase/official/cded/50k_dem/) DEM for the Yukon Territory, downloaded 8/11/2015. Horizontal datum=NAD83; vertical datum=CGVD28; map units=decimal degrees; elevation units=meters.  The 3 DEMs were projected to a common coordinate system, resolution, and registration. The Canadian TRIM and CDED datasets were combined, then a program called \u201cMerge\u201d was used to join the Canada DEM to the NED. The different processing methods, scales, and vertical datums used to produce the source U.S. and Canada DEMs result in a visible seam where the 2 datasets are joined. The \u201cMerge\u201d program creates a smooth transition along the seam between the NED and Canada DEMs (see process steps for details).  Portions of the NED for Southeast Alaska have been updated with higher-resolution IfSAR and LiDAR data; however the vertical datum for this newer data is based on NAVD88. Using the updated portions of the NED would result in an AKPCTR DEM containing a mix of NAVD88, NGVD29, and CGVD28 elevations. There are no datum converters for Alaska to easily transform between NAVD88 and NGVD29 or CGVD28. To avoid the mix of vertical datums and to be more consistent with adjacent Canadian elevations in CGVD28, the older version of the NED (pre-LiDAR and IfSAR) was used.

Research findings revealed that CBM is understood as both a method for generating data useful for decision-making and an expression of governance itself, rooted in understandings of stewardship, kinship and responsibility. Our findings also suggest that data quality and credibility, trust and legitimacy and relevance to decision contexts are key to mobilizing CBM data in relevant decision-making processes. We provide three recommendations to improve linkages between CBM programs and Indigenous governance: Indigenous governments must take a leading role in CBM programs; networked capacity between Indigenous governments can be built using a bridging organization; and CBM programs should be closely coupled with Indigenous environmental governance strategies.

Viewed from the surface, ground cover appears as a patchwork on sub-meter scales, with thick, moss mats interspersed with lichen-covered, silty soils with gravel inclusions. We conducted a decameter-scale subsurface tracer test on a boreal forest hillslope in interior Alaska to quantify locations and mechanisms of transport and storage in these soils, focusing on the OMB. A sodium bromide tracer was added as a slug addition to a pit and sampled at 40 down-gradient wells, screened primarily at the OMB and within a 7 \u00d7 12 m well field. We maintained an elevated head in the injection pit for 8.5 hr to simulate a storm. Tracer breakthrough velocities ranged from &lt;0.12 to 0.93 m hr\u22121, with the highest velocities in lichen-covered soils. After 12 hr and cessation of the elevated head, the tracer coalesced and was only detected in thick mosses at a trough in the OMB. By 24 hr, approximately 17% of the tracer mass could be accounted for. The majority of the mass loss occurred between 4 and 12 hr, while the tracer was in contact with lichen-covered soils, which is consistent with tracer transport into deeper flow paths via preferential flow through discrete gravelly areas. Slow breakthroughs suggest that storage and exchange also occurred in shallow soils, likely related to saturation and drainage in fine-grained mineral soils caused by the elevated hydraulic head. These findings highlight the complex nature of storage and transmission of water and solutes from boreal hillslopes to streams and are particularly relevant given rapid changes to boreal environments related to climate change, thawing permafrost and increasing fire severity.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5aa2df02e4b0b1c392ea3d67", "parentId": "59efa80fe4b0220bbd99b6d3", "proj_id": "59efa389e4b0220bbd999db4", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5aa2df02e4b0b1c392ea3d67"}, "5d1f975de4b0941bde64dd69": {"title": "Anticipated Changes to the Snow Season in Alaska: Elevation Dependency, Timing and Extremes", "contacts": [{"name": "Rick Lader", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "John E.

This study uses regional dynamical downscaling with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to investigate projected twenty-first-century changes of daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation over Alaska.

Wild berries are a valued traditional food in Alaska. Phytochemicals in wild berries may contribute to the prevention of vascular disease, cancer and cognitive decline, making berry consumption important to community health in rural areas. Little was known regarding which species of berries were important to Alaskan communities, the number of species typically picked in communities and whether recent environmental change has affected berry abundance or quality.  Objective. To identify species of wild berries that were consumed by people in different ecological regions of Alaska and to determine if perceived berry abundance was changing for some species or in some regions.  Design. We asked tribal environmental managers throughout Alaska for their views on which among 12 types of wild berries were important to their communities and whether berry harvests over the past decade were different than in previous years. We received responses from 96 individuals in 73 communities.  Results. Berries that were considered very important to communities differed among ecological regions of Alaska. Low-bush blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum and V. caespitosum), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) and salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis) were most frequently identified as very important berries for communities in the boreal, polar and maritime ecoregions, respectively. For 7 of the 12 berries on the survey, a majority of respondents indicated that in the past decade abundance had either declined or become more variable.  Conclusions. Our study is an example of how environmental managers and participants in local observer networks can report on the status of wild resources in rural Alaska. Their observations suggest that there have been changes in the productivity of some wild berries in the past decade, resulting in greater uncertainty among communities regarding the security of berry harvests.

Modeling species distributions often consists of quantifying relationships between species occurrence and abundance data at known locations with environmental data at those locations. However, it is well documented that native stream fish distributions can be altered as a result of asymmetric interactions between dominant exotic and subordinate native species. For example, the naturalized exotic Brown Trout  Salmo trutta has been identified as a threat to native Brook Trout  Salvelinus fontinalis in the eastern United States. To evaluate large-scale patterns of co-occurrence and to quantify the potential effects of Brown Trout presence on Brook Trout occupancy, we used data from 624 stream sites to fit two-species occupancy models. These models assumed that asymmetric interactions occurred between the two species. In addition, we examined natural and anthropogenic landscape characteristics we hypothesized would be important predictors of occurrence of both species. Estimated occupancy for Brook Trout, from a co-occurrence model with no landscape covariates, at sites with Brown Trout present was substantially lower than sites where Brown Trout were absent. We also observed opposing patterns for Brook and Brown Trout occurrence in relation to percentage forest, impervious surface, and agriculture within the network catchment. Our results are consistent with other studies and suggest that alterations to the landscape, and specifically the transition from a forested catchment to one that contains impervious surface or agriculture, reduces the occurrence probability of wild Brook Trout. Our results, however, also suggest that the presence of Brown Trout results in lower occurrence probability of Brook Trout over a range of anthropogenic landscape characteristics, compared with streams where Brown Trout were absent.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/543c3950e4b0fd76af69c8cf", "parentId": "50a653f7e4b0d446a665cabc", "proj_id": "50a64a5ae4b0d446a665ca73", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=543c3950e4b0fd76af69c8cf"}, "5514089be4b032384276c9ba": {"title": "Predicting Brook Trout Occurrence in Stream Reaches throughout their Native Range in the Eastern United States", "contacts": [{"name": "Tyrell Deweber", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Tyler Wagner", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "NCCWSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2009", "summary": "Abstract (from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00028487.2014.963256#.VRQIaY7F8qY): The Brook Trout   Salvelinus fontinalis is an important species of conservation concern in the eastern USA. We developed a model to predict Brook Trout population status within individual stream reaches throughout the species\u2019 native range in the eastern USA. We utilized hierarchical logistic regression with Bayesian estimation to predict Brook Trout occurrence probability, and we allowed slopes and intercepts to vary among ecological drainage units (EDUs). Model performance was similar for 7,327 training samples and 1,832 validation samples based on the area under the receiver operating curve (\u223c0.78) and Cohen's kappa statistic (0.44). Predicted water temperature had a strong negative effect on Brook Trout occurrence probability at the stream reach scale and was also negatively associated with the EDU average probability of Brook Trout occurrence (i.e., EDU-specific intercepts). The effect of soil permeability was positive but decreased as EDU mean soil permeability increased. Brook Trout were less likely to occur in stream reaches surrounded by agricultural or developed land cover, and an interaction suggested that agricultural land cover also resulted in an increased sensitivity to water temperature.

As such, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN) ensemble model to predict mean daily water temperature in 197,402 individual stream reaches during the warm season (May-October) throughout the native range of brook trout  Salvelinus fontinalis in the eastern U.S. We compared four models with different groups of predictors to determine how well water temperature could be predicted by climatic, landform, and land cover attributes, and used the median prediction from an ensemble of 100 ANNs as our final prediction for each model. The final model included air temperature, landform attributes and forested land cover and predicted mean daily water temperatures with moderate accuracy as determined by root mean squared error (RMSE) at 886 training sites with data from 1980 to 2009 (RMSE = 1.91 &deg;C). Based on validation at 96 sites (RMSE = 1.82) and separately for data from 2010 (RMSE = 1.93), a year with relatively warmer conditions, the model was able to generalize to new stream reaches and years. The most important predictors were mean daily air temperature, prior 7 day mean air temperature, and network catchment area according to sensitivity analyses. Forest land cover at both riparian and catchment extents had relatively weak but clear negative effects. Predicted daily water temperature averaged for the month of July matched expected spatial trends with cooler temperatures in headwaters and at higher elevations and latitudes. Our ANN ensemble is unique in predicting daily temperatures throughout a large region, while other regional efforts have predicted at relatively coarse time steps.

Abstract: Several reservoirs in the upper Colorado River and Brazos River basins in Texas have experienced toxic blooms of golden alga Prymnesium parvum and associated fish kills since 2001. There is a paucity of information, however, regarding the population-level effects of such kills in large reservoirs, species-specific resistance to or recovery from kills, or potential differences in the patterns of impacts among basins. We used multiple before\u2013after, control\u2013impact analysis to determine whether repeated golden alga blooms have led to declines in the relative abundance and size structure of fish populations. Sustained declines were noted for 9 of 12 fish species surveyed in the upper Colorado River, whereas only one of eight species was impacted by golden alga in the Brazos River. In the upper Colorado River, White Bass Morone chrysops, White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, River Carpsucker Carpiodes carpio, Freshwater Drum Aplodinotus grunniens, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus, Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris, and Blue Catfish I. furcatus exhibited sustained declines in relative abundance, size structure, or both; Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum, Longnose Gar Lepisosteus osseus, and Common Carp Cyprinus carpio did not exhibit those declines. In the Brazos River, only the relative abundance of Blue Catfish was impacted. Overall, toxic golden alga blooms can negatively impact fish populations over the long-term, but the patterns of impact can vary considerably among river basins and species. In the Brazos River, populations of most fish species appear to be healthy, suggesting a positive angling outlook for this basin. In the upper Colorado River, fish populations have been severely impacted, and angling opportunities have been reduced. Basin-specific management plans aimed at improving water quality and quantity will likely reduce bloom intensity and allow recovery of fish populations to the abundances and size structures present before golden alga.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/51e6c409e4b017be1ba34831", "parentId": "507480c2e4b090654e7b28f2", "proj_id": "4f83459ce4b0e84f608680f1", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=51e6c409e4b017be1ba34831"}, "520e226de4b08494c3cb0621": {"title": "Relationships among Climate, Water Quality and Toxic Blooms of Golden Alga in Texas", "contacts": [], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2009", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/520e226de4b08494c3cb0621", "parentId": "507480c2e4b090654e7b28f2", "proj_id": "4f83459ce4b0e84f608680f1", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=520e226de4b08494c3cb0621"}, "55f6d6d4e4b0477df11bfec0": {"title": "Long-term trends in reservoir water quality and quantity in two major river basins of the southern Great Plains", "contacts": [{"name": "Dan Dawson", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Matthew M.

In North America, they were first reported in Texas in the 1980s, and a marked range expansion occurred in 2001. Although there is concern about the influence of climate change on the future distribution of GA, factors responsible for past dispersals remain uncertain. To better understand the factors that influence toxic bloom dispersal in reservoirs, this study characterized reservoir water quality associated with toxic GA blooms since 2001, and examined trends in water quality during a 20-year period bracketing the 2001 expansion. Archived data were analyzed for six impacted and six nonimpacted reservoirs from two major Texas basins: Brazos River and Colorado River. Data were simplified for analysis by pooling spatially (across sampling stations) and temporally (winter, December\u2013February) within reservoirs and generating depth-corrected (1 m) monthly values. Classification tree analysis [period of record (POR), 2001\u20132010] using salinity-associated variables (specific conductance, chloride, sulfate), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature, total hardness, potassium, nitrate+nitrite, and total phosphorus indicated that salinity best predicts the toxic bloom occurrence. Minimum estimated salinities for toxic bloom formation were 0.59 and 1.02 psu in Brazos and Colorado River reservoirs, respectively. Principal component analysis (POR, 2001\u20132010) indicated that GA habitat is best defined by higher salinity relative to nonimpacted reservoirs, with winter DO and pH also being slightly higher and winter temperature slightly lower in impacted reservoirs. Trend analysis, however, did not reveal monotonic changes in winter water quality of GA-impacted reservoirs during the 20-year period (1991\u20132010) bracketing the 2001 dispersal. Therefore, whereas minimum levels of salinity are required for GA establishment and toxic blooms in Texas reservoirs, the lack of trends in water quality suggests that conditions favorable for toxic blooms pre-date the 2001 expansion. These observations are consistent with a climate change-independent scenario of past GA dispersals in Texas reservoirs driven by novel introductions into pre-existing favorable habitat. Reports of latent GA populations in certain nonimpacted reservoirs, however, provide a plausible scenario of future dispersals characterized by prolonged periods between colonization and toxic bloom development and driven by changes in water quality, natural, or anthropogenic.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/52d98c4ee4b08fdd52822484", "parentId": "507480c2e4b090654e7b28f2", "proj_id": "4f83459ce4b0e84f608680f1", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=52d98c4ee4b08fdd52822484"}, "50f5a9b9e4b0114312ab0284": {"title": "Texas Reservoir Water Data Portal", "contacts": [], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2009", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/50f5a9b9e4b0114312ab0284", "parentId": "507480c2e4b090654e7b28f2", "proj_id": "4f83459ce4b0e84f608680f1", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=50f5a9b9e4b0114312ab0284"}, "542aedd6e4b057766eed2874": {"title": "Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM): New Functionality for Predicting Changes in Distribution of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in Response to Sea Level Rise", "contacts": [{"name": "Henry Lee II", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Deborah A Reusser", "type": "Author", "email": "dreusser@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Geographic Researcher", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Melanie R.

Herein, we predict the effects of future climate and land use change on cold-water fish habitat in the glacial lakes of the upper midwestern US. Ecoregion-specific, regional regression models were developed to predict annual phosphorus loading rates to lakes based on land use and hydrology and coupled to a previously developed fish habitat model. Outputs from one land use change model and three global climate models were then used to project future cold-water habitat. Significant decreases in cold-water habitat quality were projected in all four ecoregions of the study region, with increases in air temperature generally having greater impacts on habitat than land use changes. Projected localized increases in urbanization and corn acreage were found to degrade cold-water habitat for a subset of lakes in all ecoregions.

Objective  This study is set to evaluate how aspen distribution might shift in response to different climate-fire scenarios in a semi-arid montane landscape, and quantify the influence of fire regime along topoclimatic gradients.  Methods  We used a novel integration of a forest landscape succession and disturbance model (LANDIS-II) with a fine-scale climatic water deficit approach to simulate dynamics of aspen and associated conifer and shrub species over the next 150 years under various climate-fire scenarios.  Results  Simulations suggest that many aspen stands could persist without fire for centuries under current climate conditions. However, a simulated 2\u20135 &deg;C increase in temperature caused a substantial reduction of aspen coverage at lower elevations and a modest increase at upper elevations, leading to an overall reduction of aspen range at the landscape level. Increasing fire activity may favor aspen increase at its upper elevation limits adjacent to coniferous forest, but may also favor reduction of aspen at lower elevation limits adjacent to xeric shrubland.  Conclusions  Our study highlights the importance of incorporating fine-scale terrain effects on climatic water deficit and ecohydrology when modeling species distribution response to climate change.

Aspen (Populus spp.) are generally considered seral throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including P. tremuloides, the most widely distributed tree species in North America. Recent declines in aspen populations have occurred, especially along drought\u2010sensitive margins of its range and where fire exclusion and herbivory have promoted community transition. However, aspen also forms stable stands, and examination of the mechanisms that influence persistence can offer conservation insights, especially where populations are vulnerable to changing climate or altered disturbance dynamics. We sampled tree age and stand characteristics of isolated aspen forests in the arid Great Basin (USA) to determine if (1) aspen communities are more fire\u2010dependent and seral or fire\u2010independent and stable; (2) ungulate browsing inhibits aspen stability; and (3) temporal patterns of vegetative reproduction (i.e., ramet establishment or \u201csuckering\u201d) are correlated with climate. Aspen size and age class densities strongly fit negative exponential distributions, whether grouped geographically or by functional type, suggesting landscape\u2010scale persistence. Continuous age distributions and high proportions of recruitment\u2010sized to overstory trees suggest stability at stand scales, with exceptions including stands with higher browsing pressure. Few stands had evidence of fire, and relationships between dead tree size and variability in live tree size suggest a lack of fire dependency. Several 5\u2010yr averaged climate variables and one sea surface temperature index were correlated with aspen ramet establishment densities over time, with strongest relationships occurring ~5 yr prior to establishment year, often followed by inverse relationships ~1 yr after. Indeed, aspen establishment density for a recent 41\u2010yr period was reliably reconstructed using antecedent climate conditions derived from a single drought index. Temporally synchronized aspen ramet establishment across the study region may be due to climate\u2010driven storage of nonstructural carbohydrate reserves in clonal root systems later used for regeneration. Complex regeneration dynamics of these self\u2010sustaining aspen stands, especially sensitivity to climate variability, suggest they may serve as harbingers of ecological change in the arid Great Basin and in other aspen populations near their range margin.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d5c703de4b01d82ce911a8a", "parentId": "507481dbe4b090654e7b2946", "proj_id": "4f833e05e4b0e84f608680d8", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5d5c703de4b01d82ce911a8a"}, "5125029ee4b0b6328103b5ec": {"title": "Fire regimes of quaking aspen in the Mountain West", "contacts": [], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2009", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5125029ee4b0b6328103b5ec", "parentId": "507481dbe4b090654e7b2946", "proj_id": "4f833e05e4b0e84f608680d8", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5125029ee4b0b6328103b5ec"}, "51c461c1e4b03c77dce65aa8": {"title": "States_Detailed_National", "contacts": [{"name": "ESRI", "type": "Point of Contact", "email": "info@esri.com", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "ESRI; ESRI International Distributors", "type": "Distributor", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "ESRI", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "info@esri.com", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Tele Atlas North America, Inc.", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "ESRI", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "ESRI", "type": "Point of Contact", "email": "info@esri.com", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "ESRI; ESRI International Distributors", "type": "Distributor", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "ESRI", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "info@esri.com", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Tele Atlas North America, Inc.", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "ESRI", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2009", "summary": "   U.S. Counties represents the counties of the United States in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

We examine the temporal and spatial distributions of Fe, and its sources in the GoA, based on data from three cruises carried out in 2010 from the Copper River (AK) mouth to beyond the shelf break. April data are the first to describe late winter Fe behavior before surface water nitrate depletion began. Sediment resuspension during winter and spring storms generated high \u201ctotal dissolvable Fe\u201d (TDFe) concentrations of ~1000 nmol kg\u22121 along the entire continental shelf, which decreased beyond the shelf break. In July, high TDFe concentrations were similar on the shelf, but more spatially variable, and driven by low-salinity glacial meltwater.

A passive tracer was introduced in the model to delineate the growth and decay of the plume and to diagnose the spread of the CR discharge in the shelf, into Prince William Sound (PWS) and offshore. Furthermore, a model experiment with doubled discharge was conducted to investigate potential impacts of accelerated glacier melt in future climate scenarios. The 2010 and 2011 simulation revealed that the upstream (eastward) transport in the NGoA is negligible. About 60 % of the passive tracer released in the CR discharge is transported southwestward on the shelf, while another one third goes into PWS with close to 60 % of which exiting PWS to the shelf from Montague Strait. The rest few percent is transported across the shelf break and exported to the GoA basin. The downstream transport and the transport into PWS are strongly regulated by the downwelling-favorable wind, while the offshore transport is related to the accumulation of plume water in the shelf, frontal instability, and the Alaskan Stream. It takes weeks in spring for the buoyancy to accumulate so that a bulge forms outside of the CR estuary. The absence of strong storms as in the summer of 2010 allows the bulge continue growing to trigger frontal instability. These frontal features can interact with the Alaskan Stream to induce transport pulses across the shelf break. Alternatively as in 2011, a downwelling-favorable wind event in early August (near the peak discharge) accelerates the southwestward coastal current and produces an intense downstream transport event. Both processes result in fast drains of the buoyancy and the plume content, thereby rapid disintegration of the plume in the shelf. The plume in the doubled discharge case can be two to three times in size, which affects not only the magnitude but also the timing of certain transport events. In particular, the offshore transport increases by several folds because the plume appears to be more easily entrained by the seaward flow along the side of Hinchinbrook Canyon.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57a8f719e4b0ebae89bb96e7", "parentId": "50747f52e4b090654e7b28a3", "proj_id": "4f833d1de4b0e84f608680cb", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57a8f719e4b0ebae89bb96e7"}, "5125010be4b0b6328103b5e7": {"title": "Glacial influence on the geochemistry of riverine iron fluxes to the Gulf of Alaska and effects of deglaciation", "contacts": [], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2009", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5125010be4b0b6328103b5e7", "parentId": "50747f52e4b090654e7b28a3", "proj_id": "4f833d1de4b0e84f608680cb", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5125010be4b0b6328103b5e7"}, "520e23e3e4b08494c3cb062c": {"title": "Impacts of Climate Change and Melting Glaciers on Coastal Ecosystems in the Nearshore Waters of the Gulf of Alaska", "contacts": [], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2009", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/520e23e3e4b08494c3cb062c", "parentId": "50747f52e4b090654e7b28a3", "proj_id": "4f833d1de4b0e84f608680cb", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=520e23e3e4b08494c3cb062c"}, "520e236de4b08494c3cb0628": {"title": "A Mammal's Take On The Rapture Hypothesis, Jacob's Ladder, And Other Notions Of Doom, Gloom, And Predictable Uniform Change In High Elevation Ecosystems In The Sierra Nevada Range", "contacts": [], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2009", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/520e236de4b08494c3cb0628", "parentId": "507467aae4b090654e7b27ba", "proj_id": "4f833bd0e4b0e84f608680be", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=520e236de4b08494c3cb0628"}, "51e6cda7e4b017be1ba34839": {"title": "Can we model the probability of presence of species without absence data?", "contacts": [], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2009", "summary": "This article is a product from the project &quot;Can Mammals Mediate Climatically-Induced Vegetation Transitions in Alpine Ecosystems of the Western United States?&quot;. Abstract:  In ecological studies, it is useful to estimate the probability that a species occurs at given locations. The probability of presence can be modeled by traditional statistical methods, if both presence and absence data are available. However, the challenge is that most species records contain only presence data, without reliable absence data. Previous presence-only methods can estimate a relative index of habitat suitability, but cannot estimate the actual probability of presence.            In this study, we develop a presence and background learning algorithm (PBL) that is successful in modeling the conditional probability of presence of a simulated species. The model is trained by two completely separate sets: observed presence and background data. Assuming that the probability of presence is one for \u2018prototypical presence\u2019 locations where the habitats are maximally suitable for a species, we can estimate a constant that can calibrate the trained model into the actual probability of presence. Experimental results show that the PBL method performs similarly to a presence-absence method, and significantly better than the widely used maximum entropy method. The new algorithm enables us to model the probability that a species occurs conditional on environmental covariates without absence data. Hence, it has potential to improve modeling of the geographical distributions of species.

Much of the focus has gone into determining which interpolation method is best suited for creating gridded climate surfaces, which often a covariate such as elevation (Digital Elevation Model, DEM) is used to improve the interpolation accuracy. One key area where little research has addressed is in determining which covariate best improves the accuracy in the interpolation. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out in determining which covariates were most suitable for interpolating climatic variables (e.g. precipitation, mean temperature, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature). We compiled data for each climate variable from 1950 to 1999 from approximately 500 weather stations across the Western United States (32&deg; to 49&deg; latitude and \u2212124.7&deg; to \u2212112.9&deg; longitude). In addition, we examined the uncertainty of the interpolated climate surface. Specifically, Thin Plate Spline (TPS) was used as the interpolation method since it is one of the most popular interpolation techniques to generate climate surfaces. We considered several covariates, including DEM, slope, distance to coast (Euclidean distance), aspect, solar potential, radar, and two Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). A tenfold cross-validation was applied to determine the uncertainty of the interpolation based on each covariate.

Abstract:  It is very common that only presence data are available in ecological niche modeling. However, most existing methods for evaluating the accuracy of presence\u2013absence (binary) predictions of species require presence\u2013absence data. The aim of this study is to present a new method for accuracy assessment that does not rely on absence data.            Two new statistics Fpb and Fcpb were derived based on presence\u2013background data. With generated six virtual species, we used DOMAIN, generalized linear modeling (GLM), and maximum entropy (MAXENT) to produce different species presence\u2013absence predictions. To investigate the effectiveness of the new statistics in accuracy assessment, we used Fpb, Fcpb, the traditional F-measure (F), kappa coefficient, true skill statistic (TSS), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the contrast validation index (CVI) to evaluate the accuracy of predictions, and the behaviors of these accuracy measures were compared. The effectiveness of Fpb for threshold selection and estimation of species prevalence was also investigated.             Experimental results show that Fcpb is an estimate of F. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (COR) between Fcpb and F is 0.9882, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.0171. In general, Fpb, Fcpb, F, kappa coefficient, TSS, and CVI can sort models by the accuracy of binary prediction, but AUC is not appropriate to evaluate the accuracy of binary prediction. For DOMAIN, GLM, and MAXENT, finding the threshold by maximizing Fpb and by maximizing F result in similar accuracies. In addition, the estimation of species prevalence based on binary output with maximizing Fpb as the thresholding method is significantly more accurate than simply averaging the original continuous output. The best estimate of prevalence is provided by the binary output of MAXENT, with an RMSE of 0.0116.             Finally, we conclude that the new method is promising in accuracy assessment, threshold selection, and estimation of species prevalence, all of which are important but challenging problems with presence-only data. Because it does not require absence data, the new method will have important applications in ecological niche modeling.

This study evaluated multiple stream network fragmentation metrics representing localized (e.g., distance-to-dams) and cumulative (e.g., total upstream reservoir storage) dam influences on streams in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, developing an approach for identifying suitable fish indicators of dam effects. We used change point and correlation analyses to determine associations of stream fish catch per unit effort and various stream network fragmentation metrics with data from more than 2000 fish survey sites stratified by stream size, thermal regime, and ecoregion. Of the identified indicator species, predominantly warmwater, large river, and/or lentic species were positively associated with stream network fragmentation, whereas cold and coolwater lotic species were negatively associated with fragmentation. These results suggest a combination of downstream thermal effects and upstream influences from impoundments generated by dams. Variance partitioning analyses based on identified indicator species revealed greater upstream-dominated dam influences in headwaters than mid-sized streams, and a greater relative influence of dams vs. other non-dam anthropogenic influences in cold streams than warm streams. Overall, a combination of localized and cumulative fragmentation metrics, as well as upstream and downstream-oriented measures, were influential in indicator species responses, emphasizing the importance of selecting a diversity of fragmentation metrics when assessing effects of dams on stream fishes. Understanding multiple dam influences on stream fishes, including localized effects from individual dams and cumulative effects from all dams within a river basin, would provide useful information for a variety of management activities, including dam operation and dam removal prioritization.

In freshwater systems, these changes may result in degradation or loss of habitat due to dry stream beds or low flows, and increased water temperatures, pollution, and erosion. Freshwater mussels (Order Unionida) are especially vulnerable to disturbance because they are incapable of escaping detrimental changes at any practical temporal scale. Quantitative information on lethal temperatures (LT) to native freshwater mussels is currently limited to fewer than 10 species, and these few studies have been restricted to the water-only standard method for toxicity testing. The results of these prior studies indicate that some species may be living near their upper thermal tolerances; however, evaluation of the thermal sensitivity of these benthic organisms has never been conducted in sediment. Thus, I sought to increase the complexity and ecological realism of laboratory exposures of freshwater mussels to acute thermal stress by including factors that affect mussels in natural systems, including sediment, flow regime, and a vertical thermal gradient. I developed a method for assessing thermal sensitivity of freshwater mussels in sediment, and, using these testing protocols, I evaluated the relative sensitivities of juveniles of four species (Amblema plicata, Lampsilis abrupta, Lampsilis cariosa, and Lampsilis siliquoidea) and adults of one species (Lampsilis fasciola) to a range of temperatures common during summer in streams with low flow and drought conditions, using two temperature acclimation (22 and 27&deg;C) and surrogate flow regimes (low water and dewatered treatments). I then added a vertical sediment temperature gradient and evaluated the thermal sensitivities of two species (Lampsilis abrupta and Lampsilis radiata). Endpoints were survival, burrowing behavior, byssus production (in juveniles), and biomarkers of thermal stress (in adults). Acute (96-h) median lethal temperatures (LT50s) ranged from 29.9 to 37.2&deg;C, with a grand mean of 34.8&deg;C, indicating a narrow range of upper thermal sensitivity, regardless of test type, species, life stage, or conservation status. LT50s from sediment tests generally did not differ from water-only tests, suggesting that any stream thermal refuge would emanate from other ecological or physical habitat interactions. Increasing temperature significantly reduced burrowing and byssus production in the species tested. Elevated concentrations of stress biomarkers were detected in some experiments.

Because of the relationship between freshwater mussels and their often specific host fish species, mussels are not only limited by their own variable thermal tolerances, but also by those of their host fish. Our intent was to compile data from available literature regarding thermal sensitivities of eight species of freshwater mussels and their host fishes, to determine if the community structure of these systems is at risk from rising environmental temperatures. Mussels were both more and less thermally sensitive than specific host fish species (2.9 &ordm;C mean absolute difference between mussel and host; range = 0 \u2013 6.8 &ordm;C). In 62% of mussel-host fish comparisons, freshwater mussels were more thermally tolerant than their hosts (3.4 &ordm;C mean difference; range = 0.2 \u2013 6.8 &ordm;C), suggesting that some mussels are effectively more stenothermic than tolerance criteria indicate, which may pose additional environmental risk.

However, the mean colonization probability was very low (&lt; 0.01, 95% CI = &lt; 0.01 \u2013 0.01). These results indicate that mussels persist at sites that they have already occupied, but that they are not colonizing sites where they had not been previously. One particular threat that mussels face with global change is thermal regime alteration. We combined extensive field measurements of temperature in the stream water column and substrate at sites where mussels occur, measures of abundance and species richness for mussels and fish, and current thermal tolerance knowledge for mussels and fish to generate a comprehensive assessment of potential threats mussels face as temperatures continue to rise with global change. Average summer (June \u2013 August, 2010 \u2013 2012) temperatures at mussel-occupied sites in the upper Tar River basin ranged 16.2 \u2013 34.7 &deg;C. The mean temperature from the hottest 96 h at each site ranged 23.5 \u2013 31.5 &deg;C. Temperature threshold exceedance durations indicated that both acute and chronic freshwater mussel thermal tolerance thresholds were met or exceeded. Another primary threat from global change is habitat alteration and degradation. We empirically measured habitat availability and microhabitat use for 10 freshwater mussel species to determine habitat suitability distributions for six microhabitat parameters. Among species, mean water depth of occupied habitats ranged 0.23 \u2013 0.54 m, mean bottom velocity ranged 0.001 \u2013 0.055 m/s, average mean-column velocity ranged 0 \u2013 0.055 m/s, and mean substrate penetrability ranged 0.11 \u2013 11.67 on an index scale. The most commonly measured dominant substrate materials were silt, sand, very coarse sand, pea gravel, and coarse gravel. The most commonly associated cover types were coarse woody debris and fine woody debris. We found a relationship between niche breadth and conservation status of a species. Federally endangered A. heterodon consistently showed a narrower suite of suitable microhabitats than the common mussel E. complanata. These findings will enhance the understanding of freshwater mussel ecology and will guide conservation strategies in the face of global change.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5527ec3ee4b026915857c8da", "parentId": "50748105e4b090654e7b2905", "proj_id": "4f833d7be4b0e84f608680d1", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5527ec3ee4b026915857c8da"}, "54611419e4b0ba83040c5b21": {"title": "Effects of Land Use and Climate Change on Stream Temperature II: Threshold Exceedance Duration Projections for Freshwater Mussels", "contacts": [{"name": "Joseph A.

Simulated daily mean stream   T   from climate change (CC) and land-use (LU) change simulations for 2021-2030 and 2051-2060 were used as input to the SHSTM. Stream   T   observations in 2010 revealed only two sites with   T   above 30&deg;C for &gt;24 h and   T  s were never &gt;31&deg;C for more than 24 h at any site. The SHSTM suggests that the probability,   P  , that   T   will exceed 32&deg;C for at least 96 h in a given year increased from   P   = 0, in the 20th Century, to   P   = 0.05 in 2021-2030 and to   P   = 0.14 in 2051-2060. The SHSTM indicated that CC had greater effects on   P   for 24 and 96 h durations than LU change.

Relevant ecological information is urgently needed to guide their management and conservation. \tWe adopted a modelling approach, which is a novel application to freshwater mussels to enhance inference on rare species, by borrowing data among species in a hierarchical framework to conduct the most comprehensive occurrence analysis for freshwater mussels to date. We incorporated imperfect detection to more accurately examine effects of biotic and abiotic factors at multiple scales on the occurrence of 14 mussel species and the entire assemblage of the Tar River Basin of North Carolina, U.S.A. \tThe single assemblage estimate of detection probability for all species was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.36\u20130.47) with no species- or site-specific detection effects identified. We empirically observed 15 mussel species in the basin but estimated total species richness at 21 (95% CI, 16\u201324) when accounting for imperfect detection. \tMean occurrence probability among species ranged from 0.04 (95% CI, 0.01\u20130.16) for Alasmidonta undulata, an undescribed Lampsilis sp., and Strophitus undulatus to 0.67 (95% CI, 0.42\u20130.86) for Elliptio icterina. Median occurrence probability among sites was &lt;0.30 for all species with the exception of E. icterina. Site occurrence probability generally related to mussel conservation status, with reduced occurrence for endangered and threatened species. \tCatchment-scale abiotic variables (stream power, agricultural land use) and species traits (brood time, host specificity, tribe) influenced the occurrence of mussel assemblages more than reach- or microhabitat-scale features. \tOur findings reflect the complexity of mussel ecology and indicate that habitat restoration alone may not be adequate for mussel conservation. Catchment-scale management can benefit an entire assemblage, but species-specific strategies may be necessary for successful conservation. The hierarchical multispecies modelling approach revealed findings that could not be elucidated by other means, and the approach may be applied more broadly to other river basins and regions. Accurate measures of assemblage dynamics, such as occurrence and species richness, are required to create management plans for effective conservation.

Declines in the abundance and diversity of North American mussels have been attributed to human activities that cause pollution, waterquality degradation, and habitat destruction. Recent studies suggest that effects of climate change may also endanger native mussel assemblages, as many mussel species are living close to their upper thermal tolerances. Adult and juvenile mussels spend a large fraction of their lives burrowed into sediments of rivers and lakes. Our objective was to measure surface water and sediment temperatures at known mussel beds in the Upper Mississippi (UMR) and St. Croix (SCR) rivers to estimate the potential for sediments to serve as thermal refugia. Across four mussel beds in the UMR and SCR, surface waters were generally warmer than sediments in summer, and were cooler than sediments in winter. This suggests that sediments may act as a thermal buffer for mussels in these large rivers. Although the magnitude of this effect was usually &lt;3.0&deg;C, sediments were up to 7.5&deg;C cooler at one site in May, suggesting site-specific variation in the ability of sediments to act as thermal buffers.

This large-scale perspective for fluvial studies depends on the ability to characterize influences on streams resulting from throughout entire upstream networks or catchments. While acquiring upstream information for a single reach is relatively straight-forward, this process becomes demanding when attempting to obtain summaries for all streams throughout a stream network and across large basins. Additionally, the complex nature of stream networks, including braided streams, adds to the challenge of accurately generating upstream summaries. This paper outlines an approach to solve these challenges by building a database and applying an algorithm to gather upstream landscape information for digitized stream networks. This approach avoids the need to directly use spatial data files in computation, and efficiently and accurately acquires various types of upstream summaries of landscape information across large regions using tabular processing. In particular, this approach is not limited to the use of any specific database software or programming language, and its flexibility allows it to be adapted to any digitized stream network as long as it meets a few minimum requirements. This efficient approach facilitates the growing demand of acquiring upstream summaries at large geographic scales and helps to support the use of landscape information in assisting management and decision-making across large regions.

Although human hazards and infrastructure damage have been well documented for tsunamis in recent decades, the effects on wildlife communities rarely have been quantified. We describe a tsunami that hit the world's largest remaining tropical seabird rookery and estimate the effects of sudden flooding on 23 bird species nesting on Pacific islands more than 3,800 km from the epicenter. We used global positioning systems, tide gauge data, and satellite imagery to quantify characteristics of the T\u014dhoku earthquake-generated tsunami (11 March 2011) and its inundation extent across four Hawaiian Islands. We estimated short-term effects of sudden flooding to bird communities using spatially explicit data from Midway Atoll and Laysan Island, Hawai'i. We describe variation in species vulnerability based on breeding phenology, nesting habitat, and life history traits. The tsunami inundated 21%\u2013100% of each island's area at Midway Atoll and Laysan Island. Procellariformes (albatrosses and petrels) chick and egg losses exceeded 258,500 at Midway Atoll while albatross chick losses at Laysan Island exceeded 21,400. The tsunami struck at night and during the peak of nesting for 14 colonial seabird species. Strongly philopatric Procellariformes were vulnerable to the tsunami. Nonmigratory, endemic, endangered Laysan Teal (Anas laysanensis) were sensitive to ecosystem effects such as habitat changes and carcass-initiated epizootics of avian botulism, and its populations declined approximately 40% on both atolls post-tsunami. Catastrophic flooding of Pacific islands occurs periodically not only from tsunamis, but also from storm surge and rainfall; with sea-level rise, the frequency of sudden flooding events will likely increase.

Seabirds typically nest colonially and show strong fidelity to natal colonies, and such colonies on low-lying islands may be threatened by sea-level rise. We used French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Hawaiian Archipelago, as a case study to explore the population dynamics of seabird colonies and the potential effects sea-level rise may have on these rookeries. We compiled historic observations, a 30-year time series of seabird population abundance, lidar-derived elevations, and aerial imagery of all the islands of French Frigate Shoals. To estimate the population dynamics of 8 species of breeding seabirds on Tern Island from 1980 to 2009, we used a Gompertz model with a Bayesian approach to infer population growth rates, density dependence, process variation, and observation error. All species increased in abundance, in a pattern that provided evidence of density dependence. Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor), Masked Boobies (Sula dactylatra), Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda), Spectacled Terns (Onychoprion lunatus), and White Terns (Gygis alba) are likely at carrying capacity. Density dependence may exacerbate the effects of sea-level rise on seabirds because populations near carrying capacity on an island will be more negatively affected than populations with room for growth. We projected 12% of French Frigate Shoals will be inundated if sea level rises 1 m and 28% if sea level rises 2 m. Spectacled Terns and shrub-nesting species are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise, but seawalls and habitat restoration may mitigate the effects of sea-level rise.

BFAL breeding range is very limited (about 28 km2 for breeding versus over 37 million km2 for foraging), and approximately 96% of the world\u2019s BFAL population breeds in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). Limited breeding range correlates with strong natal philopatry; more than 99% of NWHI BFAL breeders are expected to return to the island of their birth when they reach breeding age. Management options to prevent the degradation and loss of breeding habitat given projections of global sea-level rise (SLR) may therefore be severely constrained in the predominantly low-lying NWHI. It is currently unknown whether BFAL will adapt and establish new colonies on higher ground in the higher main Hawaiian Islands, which are currently plagued with mammalian predators...", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/50f5b01ce4b0114312ab029b", "parentId": "5074818fe4b090654e7b292e", "proj_id": "4f833dabe4b0e84f608680d5", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=50f5b01ce4b0114312ab029b"}, "54b572e9e4b03ff52702fc43": {"title": "Dynamics of Seabird Colonies Vulnerable to Sea-level Rise at French Frigate Shoals, Hawai\u02bbi", "contacts": [{"name": "Michelle H Reynolds", "type": "Author", "email": "mreynolds@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Wildlife Biologist", "orcId": "0000-0001-7253-8158"}, {"name": "Karen N Courtot", "type": "Author", "email": "kcourtot@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": "0000-0002-8849-4054"}, {"name": "Crystal M Krause", "type": "Author", "email": "ckrause@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Nathaniel E.

Seabirds typically nest colonially and show strong site fidelity; therefore, conservation strategies could benefit from an understanding of the population dynamics and vulnerability of breeding colonies to climate change. More than 350 atolls exist across the Pacific Ocean; while they provide nesting habitat for many seabirds, they are also vulnerable to sea-level rise. We used French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Hawaiian Archipelago, as a case study to explore seabird colony dynamics and the potential consequences of sea-level rise. We compiled a unique combination of data sets: historical observations of islands and seabirds, a 30-year time series of population abundance, LiDAR- (light detection and ranging) derived elevations, and satellite imagery. To model population dynamics for ten species at Tern Island from 1980 to 2009, we used the Gompertz model with parameters for the population growth rate, density dependence, process variation, and observation error. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters. All species increased in a pattern that provided evidence of density dependence. Density dependence may exacerbate the consequences of sea-level rise on seabirds because species that are already near the carrying capacity of the nesting habitat will be limited more than species that still have space for population growth. Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis), Great Frigatebird (Fregata minor), Red-tailed Tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda), Masked Booby (Sula dactylatra), Gray-backed Tern (Onychoprion lunatus), and White Tern (Gygis alba) are likely already at carrying capacity at Tern Island and therefore are most likely to be negatively impacted by sea-level rise. We project 12% of French Frigate Shoals (excluding La Perouse Pinnacle) will be inundated with +1.0 m sea-level rise or 32% with +2.0 m. Graybacked Terns that nest along the coastal perimeters of islands and shrub-nesting species that are habitat limited are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise. However, at Tern Island, seawalls and habitat creation may mitigate projected seabird population declines due to habitat loss. We predict substantial losses in seabird nesting habitat across the low-lying Hawaiian Islands by 2100 and emphasize the need to restore higher elevation seabird colonies.

The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) include 300,000 km2 of ocean waters and 10 groups of sub-tropical islands and atolls of high conservation value.

Despite their protected status, many of these species are faced with the ongoing threat of extinction due to stochastic catastrophes such as disease, invasive mammal introductions, tsunamis, and hurricanes. A longer term threat to NWHI species is sea level rise associated with global climate change. On a 50-year time scale, many low-lying NWHI may be partially inundated or totally submerged by rising sea levels. The Laysan Duck (LADU; Anas laysanensis) is one of the terrestrial species in the NWHI faced with these ecological threats.

It is hypothesized here that a self-reinforcing feedback, termed a \u201cvegetation switch,\u201d between vegetation and soil salinity, helps maintain the sharp mangrove\u2013marsh ecotone. A general theoretical implication of the switch mechanism is that the ecotone will be stable to small disturbances but vulnerable to rapid regime shifts from large disturbances, such as storm surges, which could cause large spatial displacements of the ecotone. We develop a simulation model to describe the vegetation switch mechanism. The model couples vegetation dynamics and hydrologic processes. The key factors in the model are the amount of salt-water intrusion into the freshwater wetland and the passive transport of mangrove (e.g., Rhizophora mangle) viviparous seeds or propagules. Results from the model simulations indicate that a regime shift from freshwater marsh to mangroves is sensitive to the duration of soil salinization through storm surge overwash and to the density of mangrove propagules or seedlings transported into the marsh. We parameterized our model with empirical hydrologic data collected from the period 2000\u20132010 at one mangrove\u2013marsh ecotone location in southwestern Florida to forecast possible long-term effects of Hurricane Wilma (24 October 2005). The model indicated that the effects of that storm surge were too weak to trigger a regime shift at the sites we studied, 50 km south of the Hurricane Wilma eyewall, but simulations with more severe artificial disturbances were capable of causing substantial regime shifts.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/52eef00ce4b092128d39312a", "parentId": "507466bce4b090654e7b278d", "proj_id": "4f833af3e4b0e84f608680b6", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=52eef00ce4b092128d39312a"}, "531793e3e4b093796c7b5384": {"title": "Controls on mangrove forest\u2010atmosphere carbon dioxide exchanges in western Everglades National Park", "contacts": [{"name": "Barr, Jordan G.", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Engel, Vic", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Fuentes, Jos\u00e9 D.", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Zieman, Joseph C.", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "O'Halloran, Thomas L.", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Smith, Thomas J.", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Anderson, Gordon H.", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2009", "summary": "Abstract:   We report on net ecosystem production (NEP) and key environmental controls on net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) between a mangrove forest and the atmosphere in the coastal Florida Everglades.

The endangered snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis) has nearly abandoned the Everglades, and its prey, the apple snail (Pomacea paludosa), has declined.       Objective   We developed a population model (EverSnail) to understand apple snail response to inter- and intra-annual fluctuations in water depths over the Everglades landscape. EverSnail was developed as a tool to understand how apple snails respond to different hydrologic scenarios.   Methods       EverSnail is an age- and size-structured, spatially-explicit landscape model of P. paludosa in the Everglades. Landscape-level inputs are water depth and air temperature. We conducted sensitivity analyses by running EverSnail with &plusmn;20 % the baseline value of eight parameters.       Results   EverSnail was sensitive to changes in survival and water depth associated with reproduction. The EverSnail population varied with changes and/or differences in depth generally consistent with empirical data; site-specific comparisons to field data proved less reliable. A simulated 3-year wet period resulted in a shift in apple snail distribution, but little change in total abundance over the landscape. In contrast, a simulated 3-year succession of relatively dry years resulted in overall lower snail abundances.       Conclusions   Comparisons of model output to empirical data indicate the need for more data to better understand, and eventually parameterize, several aspects of snail ecology in support of EverSnail. A primary value of EverSnail is its capacity to describe the relative response of snail abundance to alternative hydrologic scenarios considered for Everglades water management and restoration.

The effects of climate change may be particularly large in mountainous regions where climate can vary significantly with elevation. Understanding potential future vegetation changes in these regions requires methods that can resolve vegetation responses to climate change at fine spatial resolutions. We used LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, to assess potential future vegetation changes for a large topographically complex area of the northwest United States and southwest Canada (38.0\u201358.0&deg;N latitude by 136.6\u2013103.0&deg;W longitude). LPJ is a process-based vegetation model that mechanistically simulates the effect of changing climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetation. It was developed and has been mostly applied at spatial resolutions of 10-minutes or coarser. In this study, we used LPJ at a 30-second (~1-km) spatial resolution to simulate potential vegetation changes for 2070\u20132099. LPJ was run using downscaled future climate simulations from five coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (CCSM3, CGCM3.1(T47), GISS-ER, MIROC3.2(medres), UKMO-HadCM3) produced using the A2 greenhouse gases emissions scenario. Under projected future climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the simulated vegetation changes result in the contraction of alpine, shrub-steppe, and xeric shrub vegetation across the study area and the expansion of woodland and forest vegetation. Large areas of maritime cool forest and cold forest are simulated to persist under projected future conditions. The fine spatial-scale vegetation simulations resolve patterns of vegetation change that are not visible at coarser resolutions and these fine-scale patterns are particularly important for understanding potential future vegetation changes in topographically complex areas.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/564605e1e4b0e2669b30f27e", "parentId": "50746746e4b090654e7b27a4", "proj_id": "4fc4fadce4b00e9c12d8c2e9", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=564605e1e4b0e2669b30f27e"}, "5522bf09e4b027f0aee3d03f": {"title": "Defining conservation priorities for freshwater fishes according to taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity", "contacts": [], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2009", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5522bf09e4b027f0aee3d03f", "parentId": "50a6547fe4b0d446a665cac5", "proj_id": "50a64d73e4b0d446a665ca7c", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5522bf09e4b027f0aee3d03f"}, "534710efe4b0384c8d7f1ff9": {"title": "Fish species introductions provide novel insights into the patterns and drivers of phylogenetic structure in freshwaters", "contacts": [{"name": "Angela L.

The Great Lakes have experienced environmental stressors that may have changed population demographics and stock-recruitment relationships while causing the declines of several prey fish species, including rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). We investigated changes in the size and maturation of rainbow smelt in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron and recruitment dynamics of the Lake Michigan stock over the past four decades. Mean lengths and length-at-maturation of rainbow smelt generally declined over time in both lakes. To evaluate recruitment, we used both a Ricker model and a Kalman filter-random walk (KF-RW) model which incorporated nonstationarity in stock productivity by allowing the productivity term to vary over time. The KF-RW model explained nearly four times more variation in recruitment than the Ricker model, indicating the productivity of the Lake Michigan stock has increased. By accounting for this nonstationarity, we were able identify significant variations in stock productivity, evaluate its importance to rainbow smelt recruitment, and speculate on potential environmental causes for the shift.

We used remote sensing, field data and an information-theoretic approach to identify factors that showed statistical relationships with observed changes in chlorophyll a (chla) and primary production (PP).                 Spring phosphorus (TP), annual mean chla and PP have all declined significantly in both lakes since the late 1990s.

The most striking change has been the decrease in chla concentration during the spring bloom.                 Mean chlorophyll a concentration was 17% higher in Lake Michigan than in Lake Huron, and total production for 2008 in Lake Michigan (9.5 tg year\u22121) was 10% greater than in Lake Huron (7.8 tg year\u22121), even though Lake Michigan is slightly smaller (by 3%) than Lake Huron.

In theory, the identification of climatic, biotic, or demographic influences on reproductive success assists fisheries management by identifying factors that have a direct and reproducible influence on the population dynamics of a target species. More often, models are constructed as one-time studies of a single population whose results are not revisited when further data become available. Here, we present results from stock recruitment models for Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and Bloater Coregonus hoyi in Lakes Michigan and Huron. The factors that explain variation in Bloater recruitment were remarkably consistent across populations and with previous studies that found Bloater recruitment to be linked to population demographic patterns in Lake Michigan. Conversely, our models were poor predictors of Alewife recruitment in Lake Huron but did show some agreement with previously published models from Lake Michigan.

Habitat decisions have important implications to individual fitness as well as population dynamics and community structure. Resource limitation, predation, competition, and unfavorable abiotic conditions all have the potential to influence survival and future reproductive potential. Understanding how changes to ecosystem structure and function impact species and populations of conservation concern is essential for conservation delivery to be effective. Similar to many migratory species, shorebird populations are declining worldwide and declines may be related to the loss of important stopover habitat in the form of mid-continental wetlands.  During 2010-2011, I examined how long-distance migratory shorebirds have responded to extensive, agriculturally-driven alterations to wetland habitats. I focused on a suite of ecological conditions that are expected to influence migrant fitness, including habitat preference, resource availability, and behavior. Additionally, because land use change is expected to act in conjunction with climate change to alter wetland habitats, I examined a number of phenologic variables and made predictions on how migrants might be affected in the future.  Results showed that migrant shorebirds were more likely to use highly-altered, agricultural wetlands than wetlands embedded in native grasslands and did so in greater numbers. Preference for altered habitat was unexpected because these habitats had lower food availability, but preference may be explained by the role of mud flat as an influential cue, which would increase the attractiveness of agricultural wetlands. Such a scenario can be indicative of an ecological trap, where individuals prefer lower quality habitat. However, behavioral analysis indicates that migrants have adapted to using novel habitats through increased foraging efficiency.

Here, ring widths of 394 plains cottonwood (  Populus deltoides, ssp.   monilifera) trees in the North Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North Dakota, are used to reconstruct streamflow along the Little Missouri River (LMR), North Dakota, US. Different versions of the cottonwood chronology are developed by (1) age-curve standardization (ACS), using age-stratified samples and a single estimated curve of ring width against estimated ring age, and (2) time-curve standardization (TCS), using a subset of longer ring-width series individually detrended with cubic smoothing splines of width against year. The cottonwood chronologies are combined with the first principal component of four upland conifer chronologies developed by conventional methods to investigate the possible value of riparian tree-ring chronologies for streamflow reconstruction of the LMR. Regression modeling indicates that the statistical signal for flow is stronger in the riparian cottonwood than in the upland chronologies. The flow signal from cottonwood complements rather than repeats the signal from upland conifers and is especially strong in young trees (e.g. 5\u201335 years). Reconstructions using a combination of cottonwoods and upland conifers are found to explain more than 50% of the variance of LMR flow over a 1935\u20131990 calibration period and to yield reconstruction of flow to 1658. The low-frequency component of reconstructed flow is sensitive to the choice of standardization method for the cottonwood. In contrast to the TCS version, the ACS reconstruction features persistent low flows in the 19th century.

Some species have apparently adapted to climate change but the ability of most species to adapt remains unknown. The life history strategies of migratory animals are dictated by seasonal factors, which makes these species particularly vulnerable to heterogeneous changes in climate and phenology. Here, we examine the phenology of migratory shorebirds, their habitats, and primary food resources, and we hypothesize how climate change may affect migrants through predicted changes in phenology. Daily abundance of shorebirds at stopover sites was correlated with local phenology and peaked immediately prior to peaks in invertebrate food resources. A close relationship between migrant and invertebrate phenology indicates that shorebirds may be vulnerable to changes in seasonality driven by climate change. It is possible that shifts in migrant and invertebrate phenology will be congruent in magnitude and direction, but because migration phenology is dependent on a suite of ecological factors, any response is likely to occur at a larger temporal scale and may lag behind the response of invertebrate food resources. The resulting lack of sufficient access to food at stopover habitats may cause migrants to extend migration and have cascading effects throughout their life cycle.

Here we discuss how the migratory patterns of leapfrog and chain migration facilitate or constrain responses by migratory songbirds to spatial and temporal variation in climate change across western North America. Based on 52 years of climate data, we show that changes in average minimum monthly temperature differ significantly between the spring migration zone in the desert Southwest and breeding locations throughout western North America, and that these differences are most extreme for populations breeding at low latitudes (37&deg;\u201349&deg;) and exacerbated for species exhibiting leapfrog migration.

Calidris shorebirds rely on ephemeral wetlands during northward migration through mid-continental North America, where favorable habitat conditions are annually and regionally unpredictable and increasingly altered by land-use change. During spring 2013 and 2014, we assessed Calidris habitat use in the Rainwater Basin (RWB) and the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) at both local and landscape scales. Although anthropogenic change has altered the wetland landscape in both regions, the scope and scale of anthropogenic change is more pronounced in the RWB. Our results indicate that invertebrate abundance predicted occupancy, but not abundance, of Calidris shorebirds at wetlands in the RWB. Regionally, we find that habitat structure which predicts shorebird occupancy and abundance is similar in both regions, but wetlands in the PPR supported a higher abundance of Calidris shorebirds than wetlands in the RWB. Our results suggest that the overall availability of wetlands on the landscape limits shorebird abundance independent of individual wetland quality, thus management efforts should consider not only the structure and function of individual wetlands, but also entire networks of managed habitat across the landscape.  We also tested for variance in abundance estimates within and among wetlands by employing both visual point and flush surveys. We find considerable variation in predicted relationships between shorebird abundance and habitat attributes depending on method, observer, and site; variance also increased with area and vegetative characteristics of wetlands. Our results draw attention to potential weaknesses associated with traditional shorebird sampling approaches, as it is unclear whether errors in detection or shifts in habitat use account for variation among surveys. We urge further examination of sources of error in shorebird surveys in order to establish meaningful patterns relevant for the management of wetland habitat and the conservation of migratory populations.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/554267f7e4b0a658d793b5b2", "parentId": "50746778e4b090654e7b27af", "proj_id": "4f833f2be4b0e84f608680e3", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=554267f7e4b0a658d793b5b2"}, "562f7f43e4b093cee780a2e1": {"title": "Hierarchical stochastic modelling of large river ecosystems and fish growth across spatio-temporal scales and climate models: the Missouri River endangered pallid sturgeon example", "contacts": [{"name": "Mark L Wildhaber", "type": "Author", "email": "mwildhaber@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0002-6538-9083"}, {"name": "Christopher K.

For effects on fish populations of riverine ecosystems, climate output simulated by coarse-resolution AOGCMs and RCMs must be downscaled to basins to river hydrology to population response. One needs to transfer the information from these climate simulations down to the individual scale in a way that minimizes extrapolation and can account for spatio-temporal variability in the intervening stages.

The consequences of such mismatches are difficult to link to specific future climate change scenarios because the responses across trophic levels have complex underlying climate drivers often confounded by other stressors. In contrast, seasonal coat color polyphenism creating camouflage against snow is a direct and potentially severe type of seasonal mismatch if crypsis becomes compromised by the animal being white when snow is absent. It is unknown whether plasticity in the initiation or rate of coat color change will be able to reduce mismatch between the seasonal coat color and an increasingly snow-free background. We find that natural populations of snowshoe hares exposed to 3 y of widely varying snowpack have plasticity in the rate of the spring white-to-brown molt, but not in either the initiation dates of color change or the rate of the fall brown-to-white molt. Using an ensemble of locally downscaled climate projections, we also show that annual average duration of snowpack is forecast to decrease by 29\u201335 d by midcentury and 40\u201369 d by the end of the century. Without evolution in coat color phenology, the reduced snow duration will increase the number of days that white hares will be mismatched on a snowless background by four- to eightfold by the end of the century.

Puma (  Puma concolor) populations are expected to be influenced by inter-population movements and susceptible to human-induced source\u2013sink dynamics. Using long-term datasets we quantified the contribution of two puma populations to operationally define them as sources or sinks. The puma population in the Northern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (NGYE) was largely insulated from human-induced mortality by Yellowstone National Park. Pumas in the western Montana Garnet Mountain system were exposed to greater human-induced mortality, which changed over the study due to the closure of a 915 km2 area to hunting. The NGYE\u2019s population growth depended on inter-population movements, as did its ability to act as a source to the larger region. The heavily hunted Garnet area was a sink with a declining population until the hunting closure, after which it became a source with positive intrinsic growth and a 16&times; increase in emigration. We also examined the spatial and temporal characteristics of individual dispersal attributes (emigration, dispersal distance, establishment success) of subadult pumas (  N = 126). Human-caused mortality was found to negatively impact all three dispersal components.

For modeling purposes, we used PRISM data to characterize the climate of the Western United States between 1980 and 2009 (baseline for birds) and between 1940 and 2009 (baseline for reptiles). In contrast, we used a pre-selected set of GCMs that are known to be good predictors of southwestern climate (five individual and one ensemble GCM), for the A1B emission scenario, to characterize future climatic conditions in three time periods (2010\u201339; 2040\u201369; and, 2070\u201399).   Our modeling approach relied on conceptual models for each target species to inform selection of candidate explanatory variables and to interpret the ecological meaning of developed probabilistic distribution models. We employed logistic regression and maximum entropy modeling techniques to create a set of probabilistic models for each target species.   We considered climatic, landscape, and plant variables when developing and testing our probabilistic models. Climatic variables included the maximum and minimum mean monthly and seasonal temperature and precipitation for three time periods. Landscape features included terrain ruggedness and insolation. We also considered plant species distributions as candidate explanatory variables where prior ecological knowledge implicated a strong association between a plant and animal species.   Projected changes in range varied widely among species, from major losses to major gains.   Breeding bird ranges exhibited greater expansions and contractions than did reptile species.   We project range losses for Williamson\u2019s sapsucker and pygmy nuthatch of a magnitude that could move these two species close to extinction within the next century. Although both species currently have a relatively limited distribution, they can be locally common, and neither are presently considered candidates for prospective endangerment.   We project range losses of over 40 percent, from its current extent of occurrence, for the plateau striped whiptail, Arizona black rattlesnake, and common lesser earless lizard. Currently, these reptile species are thought to be common or at least locally abundant throughout their ranges.   The total contribution of plants in each distribution model was very small, but models that contained at least one plant always outperformed models with only physical variables (climatic or landscape). The magnitude of change in projected range increased further into the future, especially when a plant was in the model.   Among bird species, those that had the strongest association with a landscape feature during the breeding season, such as terrain ruggedness and insolation, exhibited the smallest contractions in projected breeding range in the future. In contrast, bird species that had weak associations with landscape features, but strong climatic associations, suffered the greatest breeding range contractions. Thus, landscape effects appeared to buffer some of the negative effects of climate change for some species.   Among bird species, magnitude of change in projected breeding range was positively related to the annual average temperature of their baseline distribution, thus species with the warmest breeding ranges exhibited the greatest changes in future breeding ranges. This pattern was not evident for reptiles, but might exist if additional species were included in the model.   Our results provide managers with a series of projected range maps that will enable scientists, concerned citizens, and wildlife managers to identify what the potential effects of climate change will be on bird and reptile distributions in the Western United States. We hope that our results can be used in proactive ways to mitigate some of the potential effects of climate change on selected species.

Other large-scale models of biodiversity exist, such as GLOBIO (Alkemade et al. 2009), but to date there are no well accepted global biodiversity models similar to global circulation models that can help guide global biodiversity policy development and targets. The lack of global biodiversity models compared to the extensive array of general circulation models provides a unique opportunity for climate, ecosystem, and biodiversity modeling experts to determine similarities and differences in modeling approaches to inform development of integrated global biodiversity modeling approaches.  More accurate and comprehensive biodiversity models are needed to understand how countries individually and as a whole are progressing towards the internationally defined targets (e.g., Aichi Biodiversity Targets and Sustainable Development Goals) to inform global biodiversity conservation, monitoring, and sustainable use (Tittensor 2014). In addition, the scenarios and modeling summary from the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) identified a need for better assessment of biodiversity models and progress towards more global models. Collaborative approaches between the biodiversity and global climate modeling communities can provide information to advance biodiversity models and improve each community\u2019s approaches to forecasting change. Collaboration can also help tighten the linkages between biodiversity and climate and land-use models as climate change and other anthropogenic stressors continue to threaten biodiversity and its ecosystem services.  To address the need for improved large-scale biodiversity models, experts in biodiversity and climate modeling and remote sensing fields came together via a series of in-person workshops and virtual discussions. Our goals were to 1) identify strategies (both qualitative and quantitative) from climate models to be applied to large-scale biodiversity models, 2) to explore NASA and other remote sensing products to assist in global biodiversity modeling efforts and 3) to address and build on gaps and data needs to inform development of GEOBON Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) and tracking and development of the next generation of Aichi Biodiversity Targets and Sustainable Development Goals.  The first in-person meeting was held in June 2017 with 20 in-person and remote participants in Reston, VA and a second in-person meeting in February 2018 with 18 in-person and remote participants in Tucson, AZ to address these objectives. Participants came from national and international academic institutions, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations and were from various stages in their careers. The workshop series resulted in three main outcomes, including a list of lessons learned and recommendations from those with expertise in climate modeling to address goal 1 above, a framework for assessment and refinement of diverse biodiversity models using remote sensing tools to address goal 1, 2, and 3 above, and lastly the development of a meta-conceptual biodiversity model to inform future model development and needs.

We include climate covariates of vital rates, including spring temperatures on the breeding grounds, drought on the wintering range in northwest Mexico, and wind conditions during spring migration. Spring temperatures were positively related to productivity in Sierra Nevada and Pacific Northwest genetic groups, and annual changes in productivity were important predictors of changes in growth rate in these populations. Drought condition on the wintering grounds was a strong predictor of adult survival for coastal California and Sierra Nevada populations; however, adult survival played a relatively minor role in explaining annual variation in population change. A latent parameter representing a mixture of first\u2010year survival and immigration was the largest contributor to variation in population change; however, this parameter was estimated imprecisely, and its importance likely reflects, in part, differences in spatio\u2010temporal distribution of samples between count and capture\u2010recapture data sets.

Major environmental changes that ultimately result in population level impacts are often first detected as individual-level responses. For example, herbivores respond to limited forage availability during drought periods by increasing the duration of foraging periods and expanding home range areas to compensate for the reduction in forage. However, if the individual-level responses are not sufficient to compensate for reduced forage availability, reduced survival and reproductive rates may result. We studied the impacts of drought on desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana), American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), Rio Grande cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii virginalis), and scaled quail (Callipepla squamata), including assessments of individual- (e.g., desert bighorn sheep) and population-level (e.g., pronghorn, cutthroat trout, scaled quail) responses to drought. Nutritional ecology forms the interface between environmental variability and large herbivore behaviour, life history characteristics, and population dynamics. Forage conditions in arid and semi-arid regions are driven by unpredictable spatial and temporal patterns in rainfall. Diet selection by herbivores should be directed towards overcoming the most pressing nutritional limitation (i.e., energy, protein, moisture). We investigated the influence of precipitation-induced shifts in forage nutritional quality and subsequent responses of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana, DBS) across widely varying precipitation conditions. Succulents were consistently high in moisture but low in protein and grasses were low in protein and moisture until the wet period. Protein and moisture content of shrubs and forbs varied among seasons and climatic periods, whereas trees had consistently high nitrogen and moderate moisture levels. Shrubs, trees and succulents composed most of the seasonal sheep diets but had little variation in energy content. Across all seasons during drought and during summer with average precipitation, forages selected by sheep were higher in protein and moisture than that of available forage. During drought, desert bighorn relied on a few key forage species including palo verde (Parkinsonia microphylla, P.florida) and ironwood (Olneya tesota) trees. Overall, forage selection was more strongly associated with protein and moisture content than energy content. Wildlife managers often provide supplemental water to help desert ungulates endure the hottest, driest periods. When surface water is unavailable, the only source of water for ungulates comes from the forage they consume, and they must make resourceful foraging decisions to meet their daily requirements. We calculated water and nutrient intake and metabolic water production from forage intake and forage moisture to determine whether desert bighorn sheep could meet their seasonal daily water requirements solely from forage. Under drought conditions without any surface water available desert bighorn would be unable to meet their daily water requirements in all seasons, except winter. We determined that DBS could achieve water and nutrient balances in all seasons by shifting their total diet proportions by 8\u201355% from lower to higher moisture and nitrogen forage species. Climate often drives ungulate population dynamics, and as climates change, some areas may become unsuitable for species persistence. Therefore determining the relationships between climate and population dynamics can contribute to more informed management and conservation decisions. Growth rates of American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) populations are particularly sensitive to climatic conditions. We analyzed long-term pronghorn population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 populations in the southwestern United States and used these relationships to project population trends through 2090 under two climate change scenarios. Fifteen of the pronghorn populations declined in abundance since the 1990s. Sixteen populations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and population growth. Models predicted that nine populations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn populations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence. Rio Grande cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii virginalis, RGCT), the southernmost subspecies of cutthroat trout, is endemic to the Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos River basins of Colorado and New Mexico. The subspecies is reduced to less than 11% of its historic range with most populations occupying isolated high elevation headwater streams. One of the greatest threats to its survival is the effect that low stream flow due to drought will have on this coldwater trout. We set out a specialized datalogger across 54 sites in 29 populations of RGCT to measure temperature and intermittency (no flow) over one year. While few RGCT populations experienced intermittency because of the serendipitous wet cycle from 2013 to 2014, the loggers provided water temperature data deemed comparable to more sophisticated and expensive temperature loggers. Thus, these intermittency loggers offer a low-cost and long-duration (battery can be replaced) solution that not only provides unambiguous and continuous water temperature, but also provides continuous intermittency information of stream flow. An important caveat of our research is that while RGCT populations may not experience intermittency during average to above average precipitation years, very little is known of their vulnerability during below average precipitation years. Grassland birds are among the most imperiled bird guilds in North America. Scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) are a semi-arid grassland bird whose populations have declined over the past half century. We monitored scaled quail in New Mexico to study the effects of habitat, temperature and precipitation on survival of scaled quail adults, nests, and broods. Seasonal est survival (39.4%) had a positive relationships with increasing average weekly maximum temperature and grass density, and negative relationships with increasing average minimum temperature and percent bare ground. Seasonal brood survival (49.0%) had a negative relationship with increasing average weekly minimum and maximum temperature, and with increasing precipitation. These results illustrate the importance of managing ground cover for scaled quail to ensure adult survival and successful recruitment. Ground cover provides protection from thermal and precipitation related stress, as well as for visual obstruction from predators.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a95754ce4b06990606a7c11", "parentId": "527421cfe4b097f32ac3f3e8", "proj_id": "52742044e4b097f32ac3f2ad", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5a95754ce4b06990606a7c11"}, "56677384e4b06a3ea36c8d19": {"title": "Effects of climate change on long-term population growth of pronghorn in an arid environment", "contacts": [{"name": "Jay V.

Unraveling the relationships between climate and population dynamics, and projecting them across time, advances ecological understanding that informs and steers sustainable conservation for species. Using pronghorn ( Antilocapra americana) as an ecological model, we used a Bayesian approach to analyze long-term population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 populations in the southwestern United States. We determined which long-term (12 and 24 months) or short-term (gestation trimester and lactation period) climatic conditions best predicted annual rate of population growth (\u03bb). We used these predictions to project population trends through 2090. Projections incorporated downscaled climatic data matched to pronghorn range for each population, given a high and a lower atmospheric CO 2 concentration scenario. Since the 1990s, 15 of the pronghorn populations declined in abundance. Sixteen populations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and \u03bb, and in 13 of these, temperature was also significant. Precipitation predictors of \u03bb were highly seasonal, with lactation being the most important period, followed by early and late gestation. The influence of temperature on \u03bb was less seasonal than precipitation, and lacked a clear temporal pattern. The climatic projections indicated that all of these pronghorn populations would experience increased temperatures, while the direction and magnitude of precipitation had high population-specific variation. Models predicted that nine populations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. Results were consistent across both atmospheric CO 2 concentration scenarios, indicating robustness of trends irrespective of climatic severity. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn populations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence.

Major environmental changes that ultimately result in population level impacts are often first detected as individual-level responses. For example, herbivores respond to limited forage availability during drought periods by increasing the duration of foraging periods and expanding home range areas to compensate for the reduction in forage. However, if the individual-level responses are not sufficient to compensate for reduced forage availability, reduced survival and reproductive rates may result. We studied the impacts of drought on desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana), American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), Rio Grande cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii virginalis), and scaled quail (Callipepla squamata), including assessments of individual- (e.g., desert bighorn sheep) and population-level (e.g., pronghorn, cutthroat trout, scaled quail) responses to drought. Nutritional ecology forms the interface between environmental variability and large herbivore behaviour, life history characteristics, and population dynamics. Forage conditions in arid and semi-arid regions are driven by unpredictable spatial and temporal patterns in rainfall. Diet selection by herbivores should be directed towards overcoming the most pressing nutritional limitation (i.e., energy, protein, moisture). We investigated the influence of precipitation-induced shifts in forage nutritional quality and subsequent responses of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana, DBS) across widely varying precipitation conditions. Succulents were consistently high in moisture but low in protein and grasses were low in protein and moisture until the wet period. Protein and moisture content of shrubs and forbs varied among seasons and climatic periods, whereas trees had consistently high nitrogen and moderate moisture levels. Shrubs, trees and succulents composed most of the seasonal sheep diets but had little variation in energy content. Across all seasons during drought and during summer with average precipitation, forages selected by sheep were higher in protein and moisture than that of available forage. During drought, desert bighorn relied on a few key forage species including palo verde (Parkinsonia microphylla, P.florida) and ironwood (Olneya tesota) trees. Overall, forage selection was more strongly associated with protein and moisture content than energy content. Wildlife managers often provide supplemental water to help desert ungulates endure the hottest, driest periods. When surface water is unavailable, the only source of water for ungulates comes from the forage they consume, and they must make resourceful foraging decisions to meet their daily requirements. We calculated water and nutrient intake and metabolic water production from forage intake and forage moisture to determine whether desert bighorn sheep could meet their seasonal daily water requirements solely from forage. Under drought conditions without any surface water available desert bighorn would be unable to meet their daily water requirements in all seasons, except winter. We determined that DBS could achieve water and nutrient balances in all seasons by shifting their total diet proportions by 8\u201355% from lower to higher moisture and nitrogen forage species. Climate often drives ungulate population dynamics, and as climates change, some areas may become unsuitable for species persistence. Therefore determining the relationships between climate and population dynamics can contribute to more informed management and conservation decisions. Growth rates of American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) populations are particularly sensitive to climatic conditions. We analyzed long-term pronghorn population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 populations in the southwestern United States and used these relationships to project population trends through 2090 under two climate change scenarios. Fifteen of the pronghorn populations declined in abundance since the 1990s. Sixteen populations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and population growth. Models predicted that nine populations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn populations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence. Rio Grande cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii virginalis, RGCT), the southernmost subspecies of cutthroat trout, is endemic to the Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos River basins of Colorado and New Mexico. The subspecies is reduced to less than 11% of its historic range with most populations occupying isolated high elevation headwater streams. One of the greatest threats to its survival is the effect that low stream flow due to drought will have on this coldwater trout. We set out a specialized datalogger across 54 sites in 29 populations of RGCT to measure temperature and intermittency (no flow) over one year. While few RGCT populations experienced intermittency because of the serendipitous wet cycle from 2013 to 2014, the loggers provided water temperature data deemed comparable to more sophisticated and expensive temperature loggers. Thus, these intermittency loggers offer a low-cost and long-duration (battery can be replaced) solution that not only provides unambiguous and continuous water temperature, but also provides continuous intermittency information of stream flow. An important caveat of our research is that while RGCT populations may not experience intermittency during average to above average precipitation years, very little is known of their vulnerability during below average precipitation years. Grassland birds are among the most imperiled bird guilds in North America. Scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) are a semi-arid grassland bird whose populations have declined over the past half century. We monitored scaled quail in New Mexico to study the effects of habitat, temperature and precipitation on survival of scaled quail adults, nests, and broods. Seasonal est survival (39.4%) had a positive relationships with increasing average weekly maximum temperature and grass density, and negative relationships with increasing average minimum temperature and percent bare ground. Seasonal brood survival (49.0%) had a negative relationship with increasing average weekly minimum and maximum temperature, and with increasing precipitation. These results illustrate the importance of managing ground cover for scaled quail to ensure adult survival and successful recruitment.

We applied a von Bertalanffy growth model and closed N\u2010mixture abundance model in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to examine effects of fine\u2010scale variability in temperature and density dependence on growth and abundance as well as within\u2010 versus among\u2010stream variability in growth and abundance of Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii virginalis (RGCT) in northern New Mexico streams. An accumulation of degree\u2010days positively influenced instantaneous growth rates and, to a lesser extent, negatively affected asymptotic body length. A nonlinear response of abundance to temperature was also observed, suggesting that RGCT productivity along the temperature continuum was affected by physiological limitations (e.g., optimal growth temperatures).

Dryland freshwater ecosystems are especially vulnerable to changes in human-related water uses as well as shifts in terrestrial climates. Yet, the description and quantification of patterns of flow permanence in these systems is challenging mostly due to difficulties in instrumentation. Here, we took advantage of existing stream temperature datasets in dryland streams in the northwest Great Basin desert, USA, to extract critical information on climate-sensitive patterns of flow permanence. We used a signal detection technique, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), to extract information from daily time series of stream temperature to diagnose patterns of stream drying. Specifically, we applied HMMs to time series of daily standard deviation (SD) of stream temperature (i.e., dry stream channels typically display highly variable daily temperature records compared to wet stream channels) between April and August (2015\u20132016). We used information from paired stream and air temperature data loggers as well as co-located stream temperature data loggers with electrical resistors as confirmatory sources of the timing of stream drying. We expanded our approach to an entire stream network to illustrate the utility of the method to detect patterns of flow permanence over a broader spatial extent. We successfully identified and separated signals characteristic of wet and dry stream conditions and their shifts over time. Most of our study sites within the entire stream network exhibited a single state over the entire season (80%), but a portion of them showed one or more shifts among states (17%).

Utilizing a new framework for ecological drought, we analyzed five watershed-scale drought plans in southwestern Montana, USA to understand if, and how, the ecological impacts of drought are currently being assessed.

The latter is typically based on the same ecological principles used to determine instream flow requirements.

Declining water availability in many regions globally is driven by over- allocation and usage by municipal and agricultural users and climate-driven changes in rainfall. At the same time, environmental flows in rivers and streams that sustain fish and other aquatic life are decreasing for the same reasons. Because freshwater species\u2019 populations are declining rapidly, it is increasingly important to balance between human and environmental water needs. However, there are significant barriers and socio-political issues that prevent water from being allocated to conserve freshwater ecosystems. This study had two primary goals: (1) Identify high priority locations in rivers and streams for freshwater conservation under climatic uncertainty and different levels of socio-political feasibility of allocating more water to freshwater ecosystems, and (2) Survey water and natural resource managers about their perceptions of climate change impacts on water availability, the major barriers to allocating more water to freshwater ecosystems, and their communication networks to better understand how decision makers perceive this major challenge. I studied these challenges in the Red River, a drought-prone river basin in the Southern Great Plains. I found that only a few locations in the Red River can satisfy both human and environmental water needs under future climate scenarios. Water and natural resource managers showed variation in their perceptions of allocating more water to the environment and climate change and could be grouped into two clusters based on their values and beliefs. The two clusters indicated different barriers to allocating more water to the environment, mainly one group stating that more data is needed to make these decisions while the other points to a lack of funding and an unawareness of the benefits to humans. The results of this study suggest that drought-prone river basins like the Red River face many water-related challenges in the future. Unless significant reductions in societal water usage happen, more water cannot be effectively allocated to environmental needs like fish conservation. On top of that, those in charge of making decisions to allocate more water to the environment tend to differ in views about the importance of doing so, if climate change is part of the problem, and how to best do so.

In response to anticipated changes, management agencies are increasingly calling for development of proactive conservation strategies (Heller and Zavaleta 2009, Hagerman et al. 2010). On high elevation tropical Pacific Islands that support perennial streams, including the five main Hawaiian Islands, amphidromous stream organisms require continuous flows to facilitate their migration between stream and ocean habitats. In the Hawaiian Islands, rainfall sustains stream base flows (Lau and Mink 2006), meaning that projected declines in rainfall and prolonged drought events will likely lead to declines in stream flow. Combined with increasing anthropogenic disturbance, these climate-driven changes may result in changes or reductions in species\u2019 ranges, loss of habitat, and/or a potential loss of species (Melillo et al. 2014). In recognition of these threats and in support of adaptive management, the Pacific Islands Climate Science Center (PICSC) has called for development of tools to identify habitats likely to change with climate (Helweg et al. 2014).

Forest managers are seeking strategies to increase forest resistance (minimizing negative impacts during the drought) and resilience (maximizing recovery rates following drought). Limited experimental evidence suggests that forests with particular structural characteristics have greater capacity to resist change and or recover ecosystem function in the face of drought. However, the applicability of these results to practical forest conservation and management remains unclear. This project utilized an existing network of eight long-term, operational-scale, forest management experiments from Arizona to Maine to examine how established forest management prescriptions that include thinning can increase resistance and resilience of forest habitats to drought. We found that drought inhibits forest growth in all climates we examined, including the relatively cool and dry forests of the U.S. northeast. We also found that growth declines during drought are more severe when the density of trees is greater, and the negative impact of density was, surprisingly, greatest in wetter climates. Our analysis indicates that snowpack is especially important for supporting tree growth in warmer, drier areas, and can inhibit tree growth in cold climates. Examination of drought conditions under future climate conditions indicates soils are likely to be drier during the spring and summer months, which are especially important for supporting tree growth. Our results suggest that removing some trees from forests can reduce the competition for water and help trees decrease stress imposed by increasingly dry conditions.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a903dc6e4b0699060648fdb", "parentId": "551afbbae4b0323842783902", "proj_id": "551ad012e4b032384278379c", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5a903dc6e4b0699060648fdb"}, "58e7df6ae4b09da6799c0fd4": {"title": "Density-dependent vulnerability of forest ecosystems to drought", "contacts": [{"name": "Alessandra Bottero", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Anthony W.D'Amato", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Brian J.

Furthermore, practical strategies for minimizing vulnerability to drought are limited. Tree population density, a metric of tree abundance in a given area, is a primary driver of competitive intensity among trees, which influences tree growth and mortality. Manipulating tree population density may be a mechanism for moderating drought-induced stress and growth reductions, although the relationship between tree population density and tree drought vulnerability remains poorly quantified, especially across climatic gradients. \tIn this study, we examined three long-term forest ecosystem experiments in two widely distributed North American pine species, ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa(Lawson &amp; C. Lawson) and red pine Pinus resinosa (Aiton), to better elucidate the relationship between tree population density, growth and drought. These experiments span a broad latitude and aridity range and include tree population density treatments that have been purposefully maintained for several decades. We investigated how tree population density influenced resistance (growth during drought) and resilience (growth after drought compared to pre-drought growth) of stand-level growth during and after documented drought events. \tOur results show that relative tree population density was negatively related to drought resistance and resilience, indicating that trees growing at lower densities were less vulnerable to drought. This result was apparent in all three forest ecosystems, and was consistent across species, stand age and drought intensity. \tSynthesis and applications. Our results highlighted that managing pine forest ecosystems at low tree population density represents a promising adaptive strategy for reducing the adverse impacts of drought on forest growth in coming decades. Nonetheless, the broader applicability of our findings to other types of forest ecosystems merits additional investigation.

Determining how changes in the abundance and distribution of grass and woody plants are influenced by conditions that regulate water availability at a regional scale provides a baseline to compare how management actions alter the composition of these vegetation types at a more local scale and can be used to predict future shifts under climate change. Using a remote-sensing-based approach, we assessed the balance between grasses and woody plants and how climate and topo-edaphic conditions affected their abundances across the northern Sonoran Desert from 1989 to 2009. Despite widespread woody plant encroachment in this region over the last 150 years, we found that leguminous trees, including mesquite (Prosopis spp.), declined in cover in areas with prolonged drying conditions during the early 21st century. Creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) also had moderate decreases with prolonged drying but was buffered from changes on soils with low clay that promote infiltration and high available water capacity that allows for retention of water at depth. Perennial grasses have expanded and contracted over the last two decades in response to summer precipitation and were especially dynamic on shallow soils with high clay that have large fluctuations in water availability. Our results suggest that topo-edaphic properties can amplify or ameliorate climate-induced changes in woody plants and perennial grasses. Understanding these relationships has important implications for ecosystem function under climate change in the southwestern USA and can inform management efforts to regulate grass and woody plant abundances.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/578f7a72e4b0ad6235cf6c66", "parentId": "551afb44e4b03238427838f0", "proj_id": "551ad102e4b03238427837ba", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=578f7a72e4b0ad6235cf6c66"}, "5b71a17de4b0f5d57879efd8": {"title": "Final Report for Assessing Vulnerability to Drought in Dryland Ecosystems of the Western U.S.", "contacts": [{"name": "Seth M Munson", "type": "Author", "email": "smunson@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0002-2736-6374"}], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "Managers of public lands in the western U.S. face enormous challenges under recent warmer, drier conditions that are expected to worsen.

Plant communities in the southwestern U.S. may be particularly vulnerable to climate change as the productivity of many plant species is strongly water-limited. This study examines the relationship between climate and vegetation condition using a time-series of Landsat imagery across grassland, shrubland, and woodland communities on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We improve on poorly understood inter-annual climate-vegetation relationships by exploring how the responses of different plant communities depend on climate legacies (&gt;12 months) and lag behind shorter-term (3\u201312 month) changes in water availability. Our results show a prolonged drying trend on the Colorado Plateau since the early 1990s that was punctuated in several years by intense droughts. In areas that experienced sustained dry conditions or a drying trend, vegetation greenness (a proxy for production) increased linearly when conditions were interrupted by wetting events. In contrast, in areas that experienced sustained wet conditions or a wetting trend, vegetation greenness was weakly or not related to wetting events, indicating that production may saturate if vegetation experiences sufficient water availability. Shrubland and woodland communities had stronger relationships with climate at long lags (6\u201312 months) and many maintained greenness under sustained water deficit, whereas grassland communities had stronger relationships at short lags (3\u20136 months) and lost greenness even in periods of short-term drought. The results of our study show the importance of identifying climate legacies and lags when assessing indicators of ecological drought, which can be used to improve forecasts of which plant communities will be vulnerable under future climate change.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58779311e4b0315b4c11ff89", "parentId": "551afb44e4b03238427838f0", "proj_id": "551ad102e4b03238427837ba", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=58779311e4b0315b4c11ff89"}, "5b9bb2ade4b02ff63f6f5d13": {"title": "Plant Production Responses to Precipitation Differ Along an Elevation Gradient and Are Enhanced Under Extremes", "contacts": [{"name": "Seth M Munson", "type": "Author", "email": "smunson@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0002-2736-6374"}, {"name": "Erin L Bunting", "type": "Author", "email": "ebunting@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Ecologist", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "John B Bradford", "type": "Author", "email": "jbradford@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0001-9257-6303"}, {"name": "Bradley J Butterfield", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Jennifer R Gremer", "type": "Author", "email": "jgremer@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Volunteer", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b9bb2ade4b02ff63f6f5d13", "parentId": "551afb44e4b03238427838f0", "proj_id": "551ad102e4b03238427837ba", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5b9bb2ade4b02ff63f6f5d13"}, "5db1e9f9e4b0b0c58b57ac19": {"title": "Assessing plant production responses to climate across water-limited regions using Google Earth Engine", "contacts": [{"name": "Erin L Bunting", "type": "Author", "email": "ebunting@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Ecologist", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Seth M Munson", "type": "Author", "email": "smunson@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0002-2736-6374"}, {"name": "John B Bradford", "type": "Author", "email": "jbradford@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0001-9257-6303"}], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5db1e9f9e4b0b0c58b57ac19", "parentId": "551afb44e4b03238427838f0", "proj_id": "551ad102e4b03238427837ba", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5db1e9f9e4b0b0c58b57ac19"}, "5b7d8290e4b045b1dc7bd758": {"title": "Dataset for climate legacy and lag effects on dryland plant communities in the southwestern U.S.", "contacts": [{"name": "Seth M Munson", "type": "Point of Contact", "email": "smunson@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0002-2736-6374"}, {"name": "Erin L Bunting", "type": "Originator", "email": "ebunting@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Ecologist", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Seth M Munson", "type": "Originator", "email": "smunson@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0002-2736-6374"}, {"name": "Miguel Villarreal", "type": "Originator", "email": "mvillarreal@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Supervisory Research Geographer", "orcId": "0000-0003-0720-1422"}, {"name": "Seth M Munson", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "smunson@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0002-2736-6374"}, {"name": "U.S. Geological Survey - ScienceBase", "type": "Distributor", "email": "sciencebase@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Southwest Biological Science Center", "type": "SDC Data Owner", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Ecosystems", "type": "USGS Mission Area", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "This climate and vegetation index dataset was collected from readily available open source data, such as Landsat.

One of the largest eagle concentrations is in the Skagit River watershed, which connects the montane wilderness of North Cascades National Park to the Puget Sound. Using multiple long-term datasets, we evaluated the relationship between local bald eagle abundance, chum and coho salmon availability and phenology, and the number and timing of flood events in the Skagit River. We analyzed both changes over time as a reflection of climate change impacts, as well as differences between managed and unmanaged portions of the river. We found that peaks in chum salmon and bald eagle presence have advanced at remarkably similar rates (~0.45 days/year), suggesting synchronous phenological responses within this trophic relationship.Yet the temporal relationship between chum salmon spawning and flood events, which remove salmon carcasses from the system, has not remained constant. This has resulted in a paradigm shift whereby the peak of chum spawning now occurs before the first flood event of the season rather than after. The interval between peak chum and first flood event was a significant predictor of bald eagle presence: as this interval grew over time (by nearly a day per year), bald eagle counts declined, with a steady decrease in bald eagle observations since 2002.

As such they are threatened in both developing and developed countries. Indeed, due to lack of reliable data, inland fisheries have never been part of any high profile global fisheries assessment and are notably absent from the Sustainable Development Goals. The general public and policy makers are largely ignorant of the plight of freshwater ecosystems and the fish they support, as well as the ecosystem services generated by inland fisheries. This ignorance is particularly salient given that the current emphasis on the food-water-energy nexus often fails to include the important role that inland fish and fisheries play in food security and supporting livelihoods in low-income food deficit countries. Developing countries in Africa and Asia produce about 11 million tonnes of inland fish annually, 90 % of the global total. The role of inland fisheries goes beyond just kilocalories; fish provide important micronutrients and essentially fatty acids. In some regions, inland recreational fisheries are important, generating much wealth and supporting livelihoods. The following three key recommendations are necessary for action if inland fisheries are to become a part of the food-water-energy discussion: invest in improved valuation and assessment methods, build better methods to effectively govern inland fisheries (requires capacity building and incentives), and develop approaches to managing waters across sectors and scales. Moreover, if inland fisheries are recognized as important to food security, livelihoods, and human well-being, they can be more easily incorporated in regional, national, and global policies and agreements on water issues.

Understanding angler preferences is central to navigating these challenges and can aid in predicting shifts in angler behavior in response to management actions or changing fish populations. Species\u2010specific angler surveys do not incorporate tradeoffs inherent in multispecies fisheries, thus limiting their application to real\u2010world management issues. To better understand angler preferences in relation to realistic tradeoffs among different fishing opportunities, we conducted a survey of Wisconsin anglers in 2013\u20132014 that included questions requiring anglers to choose between fisheries providing different outcomes. We used stated\u2010preference modeling to quantify angler preferences associated with Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, and Walleye Sander vitreus fisheries. Next, we conducted a latent class analysis using survey responses to classify anglers into subgroups. Finally, we assessed the sensitivity of angler choice to changes in fishing opportunities. Results of the stated\u2010preference models indicated that both residents and nonresidents largely prefer \u201cquality\u201d (i.e., moderate catch rate and size structure) over \u201caction\u201d or \u201ctrophy\u201d Bluegill fisheries and that characteristics of Largemouth Bass fisheries have more value to nonresidents than to residents. Aspects of the Bluegill fishery were most important in choosing among hypothetical lakes for resident respondents.

Motivated by a current fishery decline in inland lakes of the Midwestern United States, we evaluate consistency of the responses of a target species (walleye (Sander vitreus)) to press perturbations. We represented food web uncertainty with 196 plausible topological models and applied four perturbations to each one. Frequently the direction of the focal predator response to the same perturbation is not consistent across food web topologies. Simultaneous application of management perturbations led to less consistent outcomes compared to the best single perturbation. However, direct manipulation of the adult focal predator produced a desirable outcome in 78% of 196 plausible topologies. Identifying perturbations that produce consistent outcomes in the face of food web uncertainty can have important implications for natural resource conservation and management efforts.

Managing for heterogeneity in functional groups (e.g., age classes and prey species of sport fishes), fishery objectives, and regulations can increase resilience, although heterogeneity must be balanced with replication to facilitate learning. Monitoring designed to evaluate management objectives and inform about critical uncertainties, when combined with heterogeneity, creates opportunities for adaptive management, another critical resilience strategy. Although barriers exist to implementing resilience strategies, management designed to accommodate uncertainty and illuminate its consequences is needed to maintain critical fisheries in a rapidly changing world.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5526c4f0e4b026915857c6b6", "parentId": "54987053e4b07df8de5489d3", "proj_id": "52b4603ee4b029a4958d603f", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5526c4f0e4b026915857c6b6"}, "54986f79e4b07df8de5489cc": {"title": "A Morphometric Approach for Stocking Walleye Fingerlings in Lakes Invaded by Rainbow Smelt", "contacts": [{"name": "Zach J.

Predation effects could be mitigated by stocking Walleye fingerlings based on smelt and Walleye morphometric relationships. By combining 0.95 quantile regression of smelt gape size on TL and 0.05 quantile regression of Walleye body depth on TL, we constructed a stocking tool to determine the appropriate size to stock Walleye fingerlings in lakes invaded by smelt such that few Walleyes are vulnerable to predation by smelt. In lakes where the largest smelt TL is known, Walleye fingerlings can be stocked according to the model: TLWYE = 0.819(TLRWS) - 23.838.

We compiled data on biomass, production, and P/B rates of freshwater fish communities and species across latitudes and contrast patterns observed at the community level with those observed for species. At the community level, and at two distinct spatial scales (global vs. continental-North American), negative or neutral relationships were apparent between biomass, production, and P/B with latitude; however, there was substantial scatter in these data. Yet at the species level in North America, production was often closely linked to latitude, but in the opposite direction: Many species showed improved production with latitude. Latitudinal increases in species-level production rates were strongest for cool- and cold-water species, and species rarely showed the opposite trend. Species-level increases in production with latitude strengthened when production rates were normalized by the thermal opportunity for production, suggesting potential adaptations of individuals and populations to shorter growing seasons (i.e., \u201ccountergradient\u201d production) at high latitudes. At the global scale, there were apparent unimodal relationships between community fish production measures and species richness; however, these patterns became linearized or non-significant at the continental scale. Decreased interspecific competition at northern latitudes combined with genetic adaptations (e.g., countergradient growth) could explain a tendency for increased species production in northern populations, while total community production remains reduced.

We assessed the relative influence of landscape spatial processes and local habitat characteristics on patterns in the distribution and abundance of spawning steelhead (  Oncorhynchus mykiss), a threatened salmonid fish, across ~15,000 stream km in the John Day River basin, Oregon, USA. We used hurdle regression and a multi-model information theoretic approach to identify the relative importance of covariates representing key aspects of the steelhead life cycle (e.g., site access, spawning habitat quality, juvenile survival) at two spatial scales: within 2-km long survey reaches (local sites) and ecological neighborhoods (5 km) surrounding the local sites. Based on Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion, models that included covariates describing ecological neighborhoods provided the best description of the distribution and abundance of steelhead spawning given the data. Among these covariates, our representation of offspring survival (growing-season-degree-days, &deg;C) had the strongest effect size (7x) relative to other predictors. Predictive performances of model-averaged composite and neighborhood-only models were better than a site-only model based on both occurrence (percentage of sites correctly classified = 0.80&plusmn;0.03 SD, 0.78&plusmn;0.02 vs. 0.62&plusmn;0.05, respectively) and counts (root mean square error = 3.37, 3.93 vs. 5.57, respectively). The importance of both temperature and stream flow for steelhead spawning suggest this species may be highly sensitive to impacts of land and water uses, and to projected climate impacts in the region and that landscape context, complementation, and connectivity will drive how this species responds to future environments.

Climate change also impacts recreational fishers by influencing environmental conditions that directly affect fishers (e.g., increased temperatures in northern climates resulting in extended open water fishing seasons and increased fishing effort). The final pathway occurs from climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts (e.g., refined energy policies result in higher fuel costs, making distant trips more expensive). To address limitations of past research (e.g., assessing climate change impacts for only one pathway at a time and not accounting for climate variability, extreme weather events, or heterogeneity among fishers), we encourage researchers to refocus their efforts to understand and document climate change impacts to inland fishers.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58062befe4b0824b2d1d3d49", "parentId": "542afbd9e4b057766eed290a", "proj_id": "542afba1e4b057766eed28eb", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=58062befe4b0824b2d1d3d49"}, "595ffb45e4b0d1f9f0586955": {"title": "Designing a global assessment of climate change on inland fishes and fisheries: knowns and needs", "contacts": [{"name": "Springer International Publishing", "type": "Publisher", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Craig P.

Broadly, the consequences of climate change on inland fishes will impact global food security, the livelihoods of people who depend on inland capture and recreational fisheries. However, understanding how climate change will affect inland fishes and fisheries has lagged behind marine assessments. Building from a North American inland fisheries assessment, we convened an expert panel from seven countries to provide a first-step to a framework for determining how to approach an assessment of how climate change may affect inland fishes, capture fisheries, and aquaculture globally. Starting with the small group helped frame the key questions (e.g., who is the audience? What is the best approach and spatial scale?). Data gaps identified by the group include: the tolerances of inland fisheries to changes in temperature, stream flows, salinity, and other environmental factors linked to climate change, and the adaptive capacity of fishes and fisheries to adjust to these changes. These questions are difficult to address, but long-term and large-scale datasets are becoming more readily available as a means to test hypotheses related to climate change.

Long-term research and monitoring are crucial for understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that modulate the effects of invasive species. Using a large, multidecade genetics dataset (N = 582 sites, 12,878 individuals) with high-resolution climate predictions and extensive stocking records, we evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of hybridization between native cutthroat trout and invasive rainbow trout, the world's most widely introduced invasive fish, across the Northern Rocky Mountains of the United States. Historical effects of stocking and contemporary patterns of climatic variation were strongly related to the spread of hybridization across space and time. The probability of occurrence, extent of, and temporal changes in hybridization increased at sites in close proximity to historical stocking locations with greater rainbow trout propagule pressure, warmer water temperatures, and lower spring precipitation. Although locations with warmer water temperatures were more prone to hybridization, cold sites were not protected from invasion; 58% of hybridized sites had cold mean summer water temperatures (&lt;11\u00b0C). Despite cessation of stocking over 40 years ago, hybridization increased over time at half (50%) of the locations with long-term data, the vast majority of which (74%) were initially nonhybridized, emphasizing the chronic, negative impacts of human-mediated hybridization.

Understanding local adaptation, in turn, informs management decisions such as translocation to restore locally-extinct populations. We used a landscape genomics approach to detect genetic signatures of selection related to climatic variation among desert bighorn sheep populations across their indigenous range in the western United States. This approach allowed us to investigate broad patterns of both neutral and adaptive genetic variation across very different environments. Analyses suggested that ancestry and isolation by distance were the most significant forces driving genetic variation in desert bighorn sheep, but that climate was associated with at least 1 locus (i.e., location on the genome) under directional selection. The alternate allele (i.e., variant) at this locus was associated with biologically significant increases in elevation and precipitation, decreases in temperature, and was nearly private to herds occupying the Great Basin ecosystem. Our results suggest climate conditions at higher latitudes may have resulted in a distinct ecotype of desert bighorn sheep whose adaptations are still apparent among the few remaining indigenous populations in the Great Basin. We also found 2 highly supported candidate genes in the genomic region linked to this outlier. How the molecular function of these candidate genes may affect physiological response of desert bighorn sheep to climate is unclear, although their identification provides new insight into the genetic mechanisms potentially underlying environmental adaptation. We identified several other loci under strong directional selection not related to climate and described a previously unknown pattern of strong genetic divergence of bighorn sheep within the White Mountains compared to other populations. Overall, these findings suggest selection from environmental factors may influence genomic variation at the ecosystem-scale in desert bighorn sheep and these results extend our understanding of how this subspecies may respond to different environmental conditions.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5beb2206e4b0b3fc5cf902d3", "parentId": "5463c5f4e4b0ba83040c73f0", "proj_id": "5463c5b0e4b0ba83040c73da", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5beb2206e4b0b3fc5cf902d3"}, "513e118de4b07b9dc9e7e9c2": {"title": "Chapter 12: Bird communities: effects of fragmentation, disturbance, and sea level rise on population viability", "contacts": [{"name": "John Y Takekawa", "type": "Author", "email": "john_takekawa@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Scientist Emeritus", "orcId": "0000-0003-0217-5907"}, {"name": "Isa Woo", "type": "Author", "email": "iwoo@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Biologist", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Karen M Thorne", "type": "Author", "email": "kthorne@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Ecologist (Landscape)", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Kevin J Buffington", "type": "Author", "email": "kbuffington@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Student Trainee (Biology)", "orcId": "0000-0001-9741-1241"}, {"name": "Nadav Nur", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Michael L Casazza", "type": "Author", "email": "mike_casazza@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Wildlife Biologist", "orcId": "0000-0002-5636-735X"}, {"name": "Joshua T.

Detailed elevation data from 1995 and 2008 were compared with digital elevation models (DEMs) to assess marsh surface elevation change during this time. Overall, 37 % (113 ha) of the marsh increased in elevation at a rate that exceeded SLR, whereas 63 % (196 ha) of the area did not keep pace with SLR. Of the total area, 55 % (169 ha) subsided during the study period, but subsidence varied spatially across the marsh surface. To determine which biogeomorphic and spatial factors contributed to measured elevation change, we collected soil cores and determined percent and origin of organic matter (OM), particle size, bulk density (BD), and distance to nearest bay edge, levee, and channel. We then used Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) model selection to assess those variables most important to determine measured elevation change. Soil stable isotope compositions were evaluated to assess the source of the OM. The samples had limited percent OM by weight (&lt;5.5 %), with mean bulk densities of 0.58 g cm -3 , indicating that the soils had high mineral content with a relatively low proportion of pore space. The most parsimonious model with the highest AICc weight (0.53) included distance from bay's edge (i.e., lower intertidal) and distance from levee (i.e., upper intertidal). Close proximity to sediment source was the greatest factor in determining whether an area increased in elevation, whereas areas near landward levees experienced subsidence. Our study indicated that the ability of a marsh to keep pace with SLR varied across the surface, and assessing changes in elevation over time provides an alternative method to long-term accretion monitoring. SLR models that do not consider spatial variability of biogeomorphic and accretion processes may not correctly forecast marsh drowning rates, which may be especially true in modified and urbanized estuaries. In light of SLR, improving our understanding of elevation change in these dynamic marsh systems will play a crucial role in forecasting potential impacts to their sustainability and the survival of these ecosystems.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/52a89fc9e4b027f847db1b5c", "parentId": "50782a12e4b0df5513bf60f9", "proj_id": "4f8339eee4b0e84f608680ad", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=52a89fc9e4b027f847db1b5c"}, "50abc37fe4b0afbc75eb8fed": {"title": "Project Overview Poster: Evaluating the Effects of Projected Sea-level Rise on Tidal Marsh Habitats Along the Pacific Coast; an Interdisciplinary Approach", "contacts": [{"name": "John Y Takekawa", "type": "Principal Investigator", "email": "john_takekawa@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Scientist Emeritus", "orcId": "0000-0003-0217-5907"}, {"name": "NCCWSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2008", "summary": "This poster provides an overview of the project \"Fate of Endangered Species in San Francisco Bay Tidal Marshes with Sea Level Rise\".", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/50abc37fe4b0afbc75eb8fed", "parentId": "50782a12e4b0df5513bf60f9", "proj_id": "4f8339eee4b0e84f608680ad", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=50abc37fe4b0afbc75eb8fed"}, "50f82451e4b0faa3ef21eca1": {"title": "Program Summary Fall 2011: Fate of Endangered Species in San Francisco Bay Tidal Marshes with Sea Level Rise", "contacts": [{"name": "John Y Takekawa", "type": "Principal Investigator", "email": "john_takekawa@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Scientist Emeritus", "orcId": "0000-0003-0217-5907"}, {"name": "NCCWSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "National CASC", "fy": "2008", "summary": "This sea-level rise modeling program began in 2008 and is located at the U.S. Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center.

As sea level rises, changes in relative elevation of the marsh plain will have differing impacts on the availability of habitat for marsh obligate species. The Wetland Accretion Rate Model for Ecosystem Resilience (WARMER) is a 1-D model of elevation that incorporates both biological and physical processes of vertical marsh accretion. Here, we use WARMER to evaluate changes in marsh surface elevation and the impact of these elevation changes on marsh habitat for specific species of concern. Model results were compared to elevation-based habitat criteria developed for marsh vegetation, the endangered California clapper rail ( Rallus longirostris obsoletus), and the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse ( Reithrodontomys raviventris) to determine the response of marsh habitat for each species to predicted &gt;1-m sea-level rise by 2100. Feedback between vertical accretion mechanisms and elevation reduced the effect of initial elevation in the modeled scenarios. Elevation decreased nonlinearly with larger changes in elevation during the latter half of the century when the rate of sea-level rise increased. Model scenarios indicated that changes in elevation will degrade habitat quality within salt marshes in the San Francisco Estuary, and degradation will accelerate in the latter half of the century as the rate of sea-level rise accelerates.

We examined effects of climate and growing-season phenology on recruitment (8\u20139 months old) of young Shiras moose ( Alces alces shirasi) over three decades, from 18 herds, across a large geographic area encompassing much of the southern extent of their range. Recruitment declined in 8 of 18 herds during 1980\u20132009, whereas others did not exhibit a temporal trend (none showed a positive trend). During those three decades, seasonal temperatures increased, spring\u2013summer precipitation decreased, and spring occurred earlier, became shorter in duration, and green-up occurred faster. Recruitment was influenced negatively by warm temperatures during the year before young were born, but only for herds with declining recruitment. Dry spring\u2013summers of the previous year and rapid rates of spring green-up in the year of birth had similar negative influences across declining and stable herds. Those patterns indicate both direct (year t) and delayed (year t\u22121) effects of weather and plant phenology on recruitment of young, which we hypothesize was mediated through effects on maternal nutritional condition.

Here, we document the spread of genetic introgression between a native (  Oncorhynchus clarkii) and invasive (  Oncorhynchus mykiss) trout, and identify the mechanisms influencing genetic admixture. In two populations inhabiting contrasting environments, non-native admixture increased rapidly from 1984 to 2007 and was driven by surprisingly consistent processes. Individual admixture was related to two phenotypic traits associated with fitness: size at spawning and age of juvenile emigration. Fish with higher non-native admixture were larger and tended to emigrate at a younger age\u2015relationships that are expected to confer fitness advantages to hybrid individuals. However, strong selection against non-native admixture was evident across streams and cohorts (mean selection coefficient against genotypes with non-native alleles (  s) = 0.60; s.e. = 0.10). Nevertheless, hybridization was promoted in both streams by the continuous immigration of individuals with high levels of non-native admixture from other hybrid source populations. Thus, antagonistic relationships between dispersal and selection are mediating invasive hybridization between these fish, emphasizing that data on dispersal and natural selection are needed to fully understand the dynamics of introgression between native and non-native species.

In the absence of climate mitigation, over the next century human-driven climate change is expected to increase temperatures from pre-industrial levels by more than 2-degrees. Understanding the consequences of climate change on ecosystems and the services they provide are critical for guiding land management activities that aim to improve resiliency and to prevent species losses. Here we evaluated how sagebrush ecosystems in the Western United States respond to climate change by using multiple climate projections and ecosystem modeling approaches to assess uncertainty and to identify future areas of field and experimental research. We find that in the absence of changes in fire, invasive species, and habitat loss, that sagebrush is tolerant of both low moisture levels and high air temperatures, and that climate change will impact the southern extent of its range most significantly. Process-based models, which consider the effects of carbon dioxide on leaf photosynthesis and water exchange show potential increases in the growth of sagebrush into the 21st century. Compared to field observations, there is a need to further constrain how sagebrush allocates carbon to roots, stems and foliage, and how these processes respond to water limitation. Agreement between modeling approaches that sagebrush is tolerant to higher air temperatures suggests that land managers should consider enhancing resilience of these systems through fire and invasive species management strategies.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5bbcc199e4b0fc368eaeb297", "parentId": "55196000e4b0323842782fdf", "proj_id": "55195ee5e4b0323842782fd0", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5bbcc199e4b0fc368eaeb297"}, "5d533644e4b01d82ce8e3025": {"title": "Modeling Phenological Controls on Carbon Dynamics in Dryland Sagebrush Ecosystems", "contacts": [{"name": "Katherine M.Renwick", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Aaron Fellows", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Gerald N.

Thus, to understand how climate change may affect the global carbon cycle, we must also be able to understand and model its effects on dryland vegetation. Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are an important tool for modeling ecosystem dynamics, but they often struggle to reproduce seasonal patterns of plant productivity. Because the phenological niche of many plant species is linked to both total productivity and competitive interactions with other plants, errors in how process-based models represent phenology hinder our ability to predict climate change impacts. This may be particularly problematic in dryland ecosystems where many species have developed a complex phenology in response to seasonal variability in both moisture and temperature. Here, we examine how uncertainty in key parameters as well as the structure of existing phenology routines affect the ability of a DGVM to match seasonal patterns of leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary productivity (GPP) across a temperature and precipitation gradient. First, we optimized model parameters using a combination of site-level eddy covariance data and remotely-sensed LAI data. Second, we modified the model to include a semi-deciduous phenology type and added flexibility to the representation of grass phenology. While optimizing parameters reduced model bias, the largest gains in model performance were associated with the development of our new representation of phenology. This modified model was able to better capture seasonal patterns of both leaf area index (R2\u2009=\u20090.75) and gross primary productivity (R2\u2009=\u20090.84), though its ability to estimate total annual GPP depended on using eddy covariance data for optimization. The new model also resulted in a more realistic outcome of modeled competition between grass and shrubs. These findings demonstrate the importance of improving how DGVMs represent phenology in order to accurately forecast climate change impacts in dryland ecosystems.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d533644e4b01d82ce8e3025", "parentId": "55196000e4b0323842782fdf", "proj_id": "55195ee5e4b0323842782fd0", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5d533644e4b01d82ce8e3025"}, "589cce4ce4b0efcedb773b7c": {"title": "Spatial and ecological variation in dryland ecohydrological responses to climate change: implications for management", "contacts": [{"name": "Kyle A.

To quantify climate change impacts on spatial patterns of ecohydrology across shrub steppe ecosystems in North America, we asked the following question: How will climate change impacts on ecohydrology differ in magnitude and variability across climatic gradients, among three big sagebrush ecosystems (SB-Shrubland, SB-Steppe, SB-Montane), and among Sage-grouse Management Zones? We explored these potential changes for mid-century for RCP8.5 using a process-based water balance model (SOILWAT) for 898 big sagebrush sites using site- and scenario-specific inputs. We summarize changes in available soil water (ASW) and dry days, as these ecohydrological variables may be helpful in guiding land management decisions about where to geographically concentrate climate change mitigation and adaptation resources. Our results suggest that during spring, soils will be wetter in the future across the western United States, while soils will be drier in the summer. The magnitude of those predictions differed depending on geographic position and the ecosystem in question: Larger increases in mean daily spring ASW were expected for high-elevation SB-Montane sites and the eastern and central portions of our study area. The largest decreases in mean daily summer ASW were projected for warm, dry, mid-elevation SB-Montane sites in the central and west-central portions of our study area (decreases of up to 50%). Consistent with declining summer ASW, the number of dry days was projected to increase rangewide, but particularly for SB-Montane and SB-Steppe sites in the eastern and northern regions. Collectively, these results suggest that most sites will be drier in the future during the summer, but changes were especially large for mid- to high-elevation sites in the northern half of our study area. Drier summer conditions in high-elevation, SB-Montane sites may result in increased habitat suitability for big sagebrush, while those same changes will likely reduce habitat suitability for drier ecosystems.

In our central North Dakota focal area, centered on Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site, managers are concerned about how changes in flood severity and growing conditions for native and invasive plants may affect archaeological resources and cultural landscapes associated with the Knife and Missouri Rivers. Climate projections and hydrological modeling based on those projections indicate plausible changes in spring and summer soil moisture ranging from a 7 percent decrease to a 13 percent increase and maximum winter snowpack (important for spring flooding) changes ranging from a 13 percent decrease to a 47 percent increase. Facilitated discussions among managers and scientists exploring the implications of these different climate scenarios for resource management revealed potential conflicts between protecting archeological sites and fostering riparian cottonwood forests. The discussions also indicated the need to prioritize archeological sites for excavation or protection and culturally important plant species for intensive management attention.  In our southwestern South Dakota focal area, centered on Badlands National Park, managers are concerned about how changing climate will affect vegetation production, wildlife populations, and erosion of fossils, archeological artifacts, and roads. Climate scenarios explored by managers and scientists in this focal area ranged from a 13 percent decrease to a 33 percent increase in spring precipitation, which is critical to plant growth in the northern Great Plains region, and a slight decrease to a near doubling of intense rain events. Facilitated discussions in this focal area concluded that greater effort should be put into preparing for emergency protection, excavation, and preservation of exposed fossils or artifacts and revealed substantial opportunities for different agencies to learn from each other and cooperate on common management goals. Follow up quantitative simulation modeling of grassland dynamics helped quantify the degree of change expected in vegetation production under the wide range of climate scenarios and suggested that (a) low grazing rates could be adversely affecting vegetation composition in the national park and (b) understanding of the management practices needed to maintain desired vegetation conditions is incomplete.

Changing climate will add uncertainties to any efforts toward conservation of grassland in the PPR. Grassland conversion to cropland in the region would imperil nesting waterfowl among other species and further impair water quality in the Mississippi watershed. In this project, we sought to contribute to the understanding of land conversion in the PPR with the aim to better target the use of public and private funds allocated toward incentivizing grassland preservation on private lands in the Dakotas. We assembled data on historical land switching in the area and on land conversion costs. We analyzed crop vulnerabilities to weather and climate change. We examined practical analytical tools to assess the likelihood of grassland conversion to cropping. With our weather-yield-land use modeling framework we evaluated the likely outcomes of land use changes in the region. Among other land use patterns, our research indicated a possible increase of grassland acres as grasses could be less adversely impacted by changing climate.

We first estimate a non-linear yield-weather relationship for all major commodities in the area: corn, soybeans, spring wheat and alfalfa. We separately identify benevolent and harmful temperature thresholds for each commodity, and control for severe-to-extreme dry/wet conditions in our yield models. Analyzing all major commodities in a region extends the existing literature beyond just one crop, most typically corn yields. Alfalfa is particularly interesting since it is a legume-crop that is substitutable with grasses as animal feed and rotated with other row-crops for nitrogen-fixation of soils. Our model includes trend-weather and soil-weather interaction terms that extend the existing yield-weather models in the literature. Results suggest that temporal adaptations have not mitigated the negative impacts of weather stressors in the past, and that the spatial soil profile only weakly influences weather impacts on crop yields. We estimate yield-weather elasticities and find that historical weather patterns in the region have benefited corn and soybeans (spring wheat) the most (least).

Growing crop production could be achieved through higher yield per hectare (i.e. intensive farming) or more hectares (extensive farming), which however, have different ecological and environmental consequences. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that expanding cropland for additional production may lead to loss of vegetation and soil carbon, and threaten the survival of wildlife. New concerns about the impacts of extensive farming have been raised for the US Corn Belt, one of the world's most productive regions, as cropland has rapidly expanded northwestward unto grasslands and wetlands in recent years. Here we used a process-based ecosystem model to distinguish and quantify how natural drivers as well as intensive and extensive farming practices have altered grain production, soil carbon storage, and agricultural carbon footprint in the US Western Corn Belt since 1980. Compared to the period 1980\u20132005, we found that cropland expansion more than tripled in the most recent decade (2006\u20132016), becoming a significant factor contributing to growing grain production. Land use change in this period led to a soil carbon loss of 90.8 \u00b1 14.7 Tg (1 Tg = 1012 g). As a result, grain production in this region shifted from carbon neutral to a carbon loss of 2.3 kg C kg\u22121 grain produced. The enlarging negative carbon footprint (\u0394C/\u0394P) indicates the major role that cropland expansion has had on the carbon cost of grain production in this region. Therefore, we should be more cautious to pursue high crop production through agricultural cropland conversion, particularly in those carbon-rich soils.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c520306e4b0708288fb42d1", "parentId": "5515a218e4b0323842781836", "proj_id": "55159d2de4b03238427817d8", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5c520306e4b0708288fb42d1"}, "5a9877fce4b06990606ddf22": {"title": "Factors Affecting Wheat Production Decisions: Producer survey findings", "contacts": [{"name": "Tony Wang", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "David Hennessy", "type": "Author", "email": "hennessy@iastate.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Hongli Feng", "type": "Author", "email": "hfeng@iastate.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "North Central CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a9877fce4b06990606ddf22", "parentId": "5515a218e4b0323842781836", "proj_id": "55159d2de4b03238427817d8", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5a9877fce4b06990606ddf22"}, "57d82f62e4b090824ff9abdf": {"title": "Rotational Grazing and Land Conversion in South Dakota", "contacts": [{"name": "Tony Wang", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Hongli Feng", "type": "Author", "email": "hfeng@iastate.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "David Hennessy", "type": "Author", "email": "hennessy@iastate.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Mary Doidge", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "North Central CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "North Central CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "An increase in land conversion from grassland to cropland in the United States has attracted attention in recent years.

Land allocations are sensitive to crop profits that in turn depend on yield effects induced by changes in climate and technology. We develop and apply an integrated framework to assess the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity and land use for the U.S. Northern Great Plains. Crop\u2010specific yield\u2010weather models reveal crop comparative advantage due to differential yield impacts of weather across the region's major crops, i.e., alfalfa, wheat, soybeans and maize. We define crop profits as a function of the weather\u2010driven yields, which are then used to model land use allocation decisions. This ultimately allows us to simulate the impact of climate change under the RCP4.5 emissions scenario on land allocated to the region's major crops as well as to grass/pasture. Upon removing the trends effects in yields, climate change is projected to lower yields by 33%\u201064% over 2031\u2010\u201955 relative to 1981\u20132005, with soybean being the least and alfalfa the most affected crops. Yield projections applied to the land use model at present\u2010day input costs and output prices reveals that Dakotas\u2019 grass acreage will increase by up to 23%, displacing croplands. Wheat acreage is expected to increase by up to 54% in select south\u2010eastern counties of North Dakota and South Dakota, where maize/soy acreage had increased by up to 58% during 1995\u20132016.

A common tool in determining such areas is species distribution modeling which uses computer algorithms to determine the spatial distribution of organisms. Most commonly the correlative relationships between the organism and environmental variables are the primary consideration. The data requirements for this type of modeling consist of known presence and possibly absence locations of the species as well as the values of environmental or climatic covariates thought to define the species habitat suitability at these locations. These covariate data are generally extracted from remotely sensed imagery, interpolated/gridded historical climate data, or downscaled climate model output. Traditionally, ecologists and biologists have constructed species distribution models using workflows and data that reside primarily on their local workstations or networks. This workflow is becoming challenging as scientists increasingly try to use these modeling techniques to inform management decisions under different climate change scenarios. This challenge stems from the fact that remote sensing products, gridded historical climate, and downscaled climate models are not only increasing in spatial and temporal resolution but proliferating as well. Any rigorous assessment of uncertainty requires a computationally intensive sensitivity analysis accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The scientists fitting these models generally do not have the background in computer science required to take advantage of recent advances in web-service based data acquisition, remote high-powered data processing, or scientific workflow systems. Ecologists in the field of modeling are in need of a tractable platform that abstracts the inherent computational complexity required to incorporate the burgeoning field of coupled climate and ecological response modeling.

However, much of historical big sagebrush vegetation has been removed or modified. Thus, regeneration is recognized as an important component for land management. Limited knowledge about key regeneration processes, however, represents an obstacle to identifying successful management practices and to gaining greater insight into the consequences of increasing disturbance frequency and global change. Therefore, our objective is to synthesize knowledge about natural big sagebrush regeneration. We identified and characterized the controls of big sagebrush seed production, germination, and establishment. The largest knowledge gaps and associated research needs include quiescence and dormancy of embryos and seedlings; variation in seed production and germination percentages; wet-thermal time model of germination; responses to frost events (including freezing/thawing of soils), CO2  concentration, and nutrients in combination with water availability; suitability of microsite vs. site conditions; competitive ability as well as seedling growth responses; and differences among subspecies and ecoregions. Potential impacts of climate change on big sagebrush regeneration could include that temperature increases may not have a large direct influence on regeneration due to the broad temperature optimum for regeneration, whereas indirect effects could include selection for populations with less stringent seed dormancy. Drier conditions will have direct negative effects on germination and seedling survival and could also lead to lighter seeds, which lowers germination success further. The short seed dispersal distance of big sagebrush may limit its tracking of suitable climate; whereas, the low competitive ability of big sagebrush seedlings may limit successful competition with species that track climate. An improved understanding of the ecology of big sagebrush regeneration should benefit resource management activities and increase the ability of land managers to anticipate global change impacts.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/53e3a7cae4b0567f2770ee13", "parentId": "504a0aa8e4b02b6b9f7bd9a1", "proj_id": "504a01afe4b02b6b9f7bd940", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=53e3a7cae4b0567f2770ee13"}, "58dd78eee4b02ff32c6859b2": {"title": "Vulnerability Assessment of Ecological Systems and Species to Climate and Land Use Change within the North Central Climate Change Center and Partner Land Conservation Cooperatives Final Report", "contacts": [{"name": "Andrew Hansen", "type": "Author", "email": "hansen@montana.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "North Central CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "We assessed the vulnerability of ecological processes and vegetation to climate change in the US Northern Rocky Mountains with a focus on the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

The magnitude of such change agents and the sensitivity of ecosystems to these agents vary among protected areas. Thus, there is a need to assess vulnerability across networks of protected areas to determine those most at risk and to lay the basis for developing effective adaptation strategies. We conducted an assessment of exposure of U.S. National Parks to climate and land use change and consequences for vegetation communities. We first defined park protected-area centered ecosystems (PACEs) based on ecological principles. We then drew on existing land use, invasive species, climate, and biome data sets and models to quantify exposure of PACEs from 1900 through 2100. Most PACEs experienced substantial change over the 20th century (&gt;740% average increase in housing density since 1940, 13% of vascular plants are presently nonnative, temperature increase of 1&deg;C/100 yr since 1895 in 80% of PACEs), and projections suggest that many of these trends will continue at similar or increasingly greater rates (255% increase in housing density by 2100, temperature increase of 2.5&deg; - 4.5&deg;C/100 yr, 30% of PACE areas may lose their current biomes by 2030). In the coming century, housing densities are projected to increase in PACEs at about 82% of the rate of since 1940. The rate of climate warming in the coming century is projected to be 2.5 - 5.8 times higher than that measured in the past century. Underlying these averages, exposure of individual park PACEs to change agents differ in important ways. For example, parks such as Great Smoky Mountains exhibit high land use and low climate exposure, others such as Great Sand Dunes exhibit low land use and high climate exposure, and a few such as Point Reyes exhibit high exposure on both axes. The cumulative and synergistic effects of such changes in land use, invasives, and climate are expected to dramatically impact ecosystem function and biodiversity in national parks. These results are foundational to developing effective adaptation strategies and suggest policies to better safeguard parks under broad-scale environmental change.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/52e9925be4b0e3958e1bf39e", "parentId": "504a0aa8e4b02b6b9f7bd9a1", "proj_id": "504a01afe4b02b6b9f7bd940", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=52e9925be4b0e3958e1bf39e"}, "52e99405e4b0e3958e1bf3af": {"title": "Woodland Dynamics at the Northern Range Periphery: A Challenge for Protected Area Management in a Changing World", "contacts": [{"name": "Scott L.

This dilemma may be pronounced at range peripheries where rates of change are accelerated and ongoing invasions often are perceived as threats to local ecosystems. We provide an example from City of Rocks National Reserve (CIRO) in southern Idaho, positioned at the northern range periphery of pinyon-juniper (P-J) woodland. Reserve managers are concerned about P-J woodland encroachment into adjacent sagebrush steppe, but the rates and biophysical variability of encroachment are not well documented and management options are not well understood. We quantified the rate and extent of woodland change between 1950 and 2009 based on a random sample of aerial photo interpretation plots distributed across biophysical gradients. Our study revealed that woodland cover remained at approximately 20% of the study area over the 59-year period. In the absence of disturbance, P-J woodlands exhibited the highest rate of increase among vegetation types at 0.37% yr - 1. Overall, late-successional P-J stands increased in area by over 100% through the process of densification (infilling). However, wildfires during the period resulted in a net decrease of woody evergreen vegetation, particularly among early and mid-successional P-J stands. Elevated wildfire risk associated with expanding novel annual grasslands and drought is likely to continue to be a fundamental driver of change in CIRO woodlands. Because P-J woodlands contribute to regional biodiversity and may contract at trailing edges with global warming, CIRO may become important to P-J woodland conservation in the future. Our study provides a widely applicable toolset for assessing woodland ecotone dynamics that can help managers reconcile the competing demands to maintain historical fidelity and contribute meaningfully to the U.S. protected area network in a future with novel, no-analog ecosystems.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/52e99405e4b0e3958e1bf3af", "parentId": "504a0aa8e4b02b6b9f7bd9a1", "proj_id": "504a01afe4b02b6b9f7bd940", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=52e99405e4b0e3958e1bf3af"}, "5388dc59e4b0318b93126396": {"title": "Understanding relationships among abundance, extirpation, and climate at ecoregional scales", "contacts": [{"name": "Erik A Beever", "type": "Author", "email": "ebeever@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0002-9369-486X"}, {"name": "Dobrowski, S.Z.", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Long, J.", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Mynsberge, A.R.", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Nathan Piekielek", "type": "Author", "email": "npiekielek@gmail.com", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "North Central CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "North Central CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "Abstract (from http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/12-2174.1):  Recent research on mountain-dwelling species has illustrated changes in species' distributional patterns in response to climate change.

Additionally, we tested whether various modeled aspects of ecohydrology better predicted relative density than did average annual precipitation, and whether risk of site-wide extirpation predicted subsequent population counts of pikas. We observed several patterns of change in pika abundance at range edges that likely constitute early warnings of distributional shifts. Predictors of pika abundance differed strongly between the survey periods, as did pika extirpation patterns previously reported from this region. Additionally, maximum snowpack and growing-season precipitation resulted in better-supported models than those using average annual precipitation, and constituted two of the top three predictors of pika density in the 2000s surveys (affecting pikas perhaps via vegetation).

A principle challenge is to minimize the impacts of surrounding land use on park condition and biodiversity. In the absence of ideal sets of data and models, the present study develops methods and results that demonstrate a coarse-filter approach to understanding the effects of land use change on habitat types for four pilot study-areas. The area of analysis for each park is defined by a protected-area-centered-ecosystem. Habitat types were defined by biophysical factors assumed to represent the distribution of vegetation communities as they may have existed prior to European settlement. Present-day land use was overlaid on historical habitat and change in area and pattern was quantified for private and public lands separately. Results suggest that patterns of development are affecting study-areas differently. Therefore, the conservation challenges faced by each study-area are distinct to their landscape contexts. For some parks, the primary challenge is to work towards maintaining ecosystem condition in its present or near-present state while paying particular attention to habitats that are underrepresented on public lands.

A principle challenge is to minimize the impacts of surrounding land use on park condition and biodiversity. In the absence of ideal sets of data and models, the present study develops methods and results that demonstrate a coarse-filter approach to understanding the effects of land use change on habitat types for four pilot study-areas. The area of analysis for each park is defined by a protected-area-centered-ecosystem. Habitat types were defined by biophysical factors assumed to represent the distribution of vegetation communities as they may have existed prior to European settlement. Present-day land use was overlaid on historical habitat and change in area and pattern was quantified for private and public lands separately. Results suggest that patterns of development are affecting study-areas differently. Therefore, the conservation challenges faced by each study-area are distinct to their landscape contexts. For some parks, the primary challenge is to work towards maintaining ecosystem condition in its present or near-present state while paying particular attention to habitats that are underrepresented on public lands. For other parks, the challenge is to address spatially aggregated land use that is affecting only a few habitat types. For still other parks, the challenge is to maintain connectivity with a regional network of protected lands and to undertake restoration projects where feasible.

To address these limitations, we present a statistical framework for producing a 30-arcsec (\u223c800-m) resolution gridded dataset of daily minimum and maximum temperature and related uncertainty from 1948 to 2012 for the conterminous United States. Like other datasets, we use weather station data and elevation-based predictors of temperature, but also implement a unique spatio-temporal interpolation that incorporates remotely sensed 1-km land skin temperature. The framework is able to capture several complex topoclimatic variations, including minimum temperature inversions, and represent spatial uncertainty in interpolated normal temperatures. Overall mean absolute errors for annual normal minimum and maximum temperature are 0.78 and 0.56 &deg;C, respectively. Homogenization of input station data also allows interpolated temperature trends to be more consistent with US Historical Climate Network trends compared to those of existing interpolated topoclimatic datasets.

Here we address this shortcoming by focusing on four major questions: (1) How accurate are downscaled, gridded climate data sets in terms of temperature and precipitation estimates? (2) Are there significant regional differences in accuracy among data sets? (3) How accurate are their mean values compared with extremes? (4) Does their accuracy depend on spatial resolution? We compared eight widely used downscaled data sets that provide gridded daily weather data for recent decades across the United States. We found considerable differences among data sets and between downscaled and weather station data. Temperature is represented more accurately than precipitation, and climate averages are more accurate than weather extremes. The data set exhibiting the best agreement with station data varies among ecoregions. Surprisingly, the accuracy of the data sets does not depend on spatial resolution. Although some inherent differences among data sets and weather station data are to be expected, our findings highlight how much different interpolation methods affect downscaled weather data, even for local comparisons with nearby weather stations located inside a grid cell.

We combined field observations with climate, hydrology, and phenology models to simulate future change in synchrony of seed release and snowmelt peaks in the South Platte River Basin, Colorado, for three Salicaceae species that dominate western USA riparian forests. Chilling requirements for overcoming winter endodormancy were strongest in Salix exigua, moderately supported for Populus deltoides, and indiscernible in Salix amygdaloides. Ensemble mean projected warming of 3.5\u00b0C shifted snowmelt peaks 10\u201319 d earlier relative to S. exigua and P. deltoides seed release, because decreased winter chilling combined with increased spring forcing limited change in their phenology. By contrast, warming shifted both snowmelt peaks and S. amygdaloides seed release 21 d earlier, maintaining their synchrony.

The code was developed in the R programming environment. The file \"sim_code.R\" contains the initialization of the parameters and analysis; the file \"pop_sim.ccp\" is a C++ program that executes the actual simulation and returns the results to R. We developed a hypothetical scenario in which a manager is tasked with control of invasive plants on 100 management units each 100 ha in size. 90 of these units were assumed to be under private management and 10 were assumed to be conservation units (i.e. under public management). For this problem we assumed that there were only two target species to control: leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) and yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris). These two species were identified of examples of species that are controlled within the LCC geography. They are also species for which there is some literature to help parameterize a model. We should note that this model is gross generalization and was not intended to provide insight into invasive species biology. Because this model is stochastic, we measured this objective as the number of years out of 50 that at least 50% of the units were uninfested. We arbitrarily chose the target of 50%, which could have been any value. However, we felt that because these species are so difficult to control, target of 50% was fairly attainable. The dynamics of the model assume that management units can either be infested with one of the species, both of them or none at all. We further assumed that once a unit was infested, the species immediately achieved some average density and began producing propagules. These propagules had to disperse some arbitrary distance before they could infest another unit. Once those seeds landed in an uninfested unit, there was some probability they would lead to an infestation. To describe infestation dynamics, we developed a model that was composed of eight states to describe the management units. The model simulates the dynamics of infestation and control and then produces an Expected Value of Information analysis that shows the improvement in performance given resolution of each uncertain parameter in the model.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5783f9d0e4b0ac0b97f56038", "parentId": "504a090fe4b02b6b9f7bd978", "proj_id": "5012b1c2e4b05140039e0345", "purpose": "To evaluate the Epected Value of Information for resolving uncertainty in each model parameter.

We found that rates of climate and land use change varied across the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, as did the responses of ecosystems to these changes.

In order to plan for this uncertain future, managers have begun to use a tool known as climate change scenario planning, in which data from climate models are used to identify different plausible future climate conditions and their impacts, known as \u201cscenarios,\u201d for a specific area.   In a previous project, we (scientists with the North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey, and National Park Service) worked with natural resource managers at Badlands National Park and on surrounding federal and tribal lands to assess how different climate conditions and management activities would affect the area\u2019s resources. To make the results of this work more accessible to managers and the public, the present project produced a National Park Service \u201cResource Brief\u201d summarizing insights from a scenario planning workshop and an ecological simulation model built specifically for the focus area. The Brief highlights actions that the park can take to address resource management challenges associated with the range of plausible climate futures.   Building on the work at Badlands, we also designed and pilot-tested a process for deeply integrating climate change scenario planning into National Park Service (NPS) Resource Stewardship Strategies. These strategies are part of NPS\u2019s streamlined approach for guiding prioritization of a park\u2019s investments in resource stewardship. The process we designed helped managers at the case study park \u2013 Devils Tower National Monument \u2013 adjust their resource management goals to be achievable across the range of plausible climate futures, and to prioritize activities that will prepare the park for whatever future climate materializes.   We then documented this integration process as a supplement to standard Resource Stewardship Strategy preparation guidance followed by each park as it develops its Strategy. This allows the lessons learned in this case study to be applied to many other parks across the nation.)

LERI assesses anomalies in actual evapotranspiration (ETa), as percentiles, across the Contiguous US and northern Mexico at a 1-km spatial resolution. LERI is based on the ETa data produced by the U. S. Geological Survey using the operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model. SSEBop combines evapotranspiration fraction generated from remotely sensed MODIS thermal imagery, acquired every 8 days, with climatological atmospheric evaporative demand. To quantify LERI, a rank-based, non-parametric method is used to estimate percentiles of the SSEBop ETa, over a period of ETa accumulation, compared to the available period of record (January 2000 to present). LERI percentiles are also binned into four drought categories (LD0 - LD3) analogous to the US Drought Monitor (USDM) categories (i.e. D0-D3) and using the same percentile breaks that USDM considers for soil moisture. By its numerical design, LERI essentially represents the evaporative response of the landscape driven primarily by the anomalous state of soil moisture to meet the climatological atmospheric demand through a combination of evaporation (from soil and leaf surfaces) and transpiration (root-stomata-air) processes. Real-time and high-resolution assessment of this soil moisture state is extremely salient to understanding and forecasting ecological responses. LERI serves as an experimental drought-monitoring and early warning guidance tool and has the potential to inform research into understanding characteristics of Ecological Drought.

One common management tool used to restore grassland is the application of a seed-mix of native prairie plant species. While this technique is effective in the short-term, it is critical that species' resilience to changing climate be evaluated when designing these mixes. By utilizing species distribution models (SDMs), species' bioclimatic envelopes\u2013and thus the geographic area suitable for them\u2013can be quantified and predicted under various future climate regimes, and current seed-mixes may be modified to include more climate resilient species or exclude more affected species. We evaluated climate response on plant functional groups to examine the generalizability of climate response among species of particular functional groups. We selected 14 prairie species representing the functional groups of cool-season and warm-season grasses, forbs, and legumes and we modeled their responses under both a moderate and more extreme predicted future. Our functional group \u201ccomposite maps\u201d show that warm-season grasses, forbs, and legumes responded similarly to other species within their functional group, while cool-season grasses showed less inter-species concordance. The value of functional group as a rough method for evaluating climate-resilience is therefore supported, but candidate cool-season grass species will require more individualized attention.

These collaborations were driven by stakeholder needs to help managers and user respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change to the resources that they manage. Our main goal here was to enhance the collaborative engagement process to facilitate the development of research that informs climate change adaptation planning. We did this by establishing, in collaboration with tribal representatives, guidelines for tribal engagement and supported a number of tribal entities interested in vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning. We also supported regional drought synthesis work with multiple drought researchers, where we identified the types and scales of drought decision-making on public and tribal lands and the obstacles that hindered drought responses. This was useful to identify needs for more regional, collaborative, and anticipatory drought management, as well as understanding local complexities of drought management with broader generalizations about how drought decisions are made in these contexts. We also led a collaborative social-ecological vulnerability assessment with a Colorado BLM field office to inform their assessment and planning efforts. This led to the development of a process and lessons learned for collaborating with BLM and other public land management agencies to produce locally-informed and relevant climate science, which we argue can provide a useful guide for natural resource managers and researchers looking to engage in collaborative projects with these entities on climate-related management issues.

These communities occur across a variety of environmental gradients, disturbance regimes, structural conditions and species compositions, including three species of juniper and two species of pinyon. PJ communities have experienced substantial changes in recent decades and identifying appropriate management strategies for these diverse communities is a growing challenge. Here, we surveyed the literature and compiled 441 studies to characterize patterns in research on PJ communities through time, across geographic space and climatic conditions, and among focal species. We evaluate the state of knowledge for three focal topics: 1) historical stand dynamics and responses to disturbance, 2) land management actions and their effects, and 3) potential future responses to changing climate. We identified large and potentially important gaps in our understanding of pinyon-juniper communities both geographically and topically. The effect of drought on Pinus edulis, the pinyon pine species in eastern PJ communities was frequently addressed, while few studies focused on drought effects on Pinus monophylla, which occurs in western PJ communities. The largest proportion of studies that examined land management actions only measured their effects for one year. Grazing was a common land-use across the geographic range of PJ communities yet was rarely studied. We found only 39 studies that had information on the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and most were concentrated on Pinus edulis. These results provide a synthetic perspective on PJ communities that can help natural resource managers identify relevant knowledge needed for decision-making and researchers design new studies to fill important knowledge gaps.)

For the sub-alpine species whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), warming temperatures may indirectly result in loss of suitable bioclimatic habitat, reducing its distribution within its historic range. This research focuses on understanding the patterns of spatiotemporal variability for future projected P.albicaulis suitable habitat in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) through a bioclimatic envelope approach. Since intermodel variability from General Circulation Models (GCMs) lead to differing predictions regarding the magnitude and direction of modeled suitable habitat area, nine bias-corrected statistically down-scaled GCMs were utilized to understand the uncertainty associated with modeled projections. P.albicaulis was modeled using a Random Forests algorithm for the 1980-2010 climate period and showed strong presence/absence separations by summer maximum temperatures and springtime snowpack. Patterns of projected habitat change by the end of the century suggested a constant decrease in suitable climate area from the 2010 baseline for both Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5 and 4.5 climate forcing scenarios. Percent suitable climate area estimates ranged from 2-29% and 0.04-10% by 2099 for RCP 8.5 and 4.5 respectively. Habitat projections between GCMs displayed a decrease of variability over the 2010-2099 time period related to consistent warming above the 1910-2010 temperature normal after 2070 for all GCMs. A decreasing pattern of projected P.albicaulis suitable habitat area change was consistent across GCMs, despite strong differences in magnitude. Future ecological research in species distribution modeling should consider a full suite of GCM projections in the analysis to reduce extreme range contractions/expansions predictions. The results suggest that restoration strageties such as planting of seedlings and controlling competing vegetation may be necessary to maintain P.albicaulis in the GYA under the more extreme future climate scenarios.

Few existing climate adaptation frameworks prescribe where to place management actions to be most effective under anticipated future climate conditions.  We developed an approach to spatially allocate climate adaptation actions and applied the method to whitebark pine (WBP; Pinus albicaulis) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE).  WBP is expected to be vulnerable to climate-mediated shifts in suitable habitat, pests, pathogens, and fire. We worked with a team of biologists and managers to identify management actions aimed at mitigating climate impacts to WBP. Identified actions were spatially allocated across the GYE under two management strategies: (1) current management and (2) climate-informed management which used projected climate suitability for WBP and competing tree species to place management actions.  The current management strategy reflected current legal, policy and access contraints, such as restricting active management in Wilderness and remote locations, while the climate-informed management strategy was designed to maximize preservation of WBP forests regardless of such constraints. Thus, the climate-informed strategy highlighted how the spatial location of management actions might need to shift to most effectively maintain WBP forests under future climate conditions. The spatial distribution of actions and area treated differed among the current and climate-informed management strategies, with 33-60% more wilderness area prioritized for action under climate-informed management. High priority areas for implementing management actions include the 1-8% of the GYE where current and climate-informed management agreed, since this is where actions are most likely to be successful in the long-term and where current management permits implementation.

Since the whitebark pine species has a range that traverses different federal land designations, we examine whether attitudes towards management strategies differ by jurisdiction (i.e. wilderness or federal lands more generally). We conducted a web and mail survey of residents from Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, with 1,617 valid responses and a response rate of 16%.

Federal agencies have adapted a framework for considering climate change when implementing management actions. This project was designed to demonstrate how elements of that framework, climate science, ecological forecasting, and natural resource management, can be linked to best maintain natural resources under climate change. The project focused on the whitebark pine (WBP) tree. This species occupies high mountain forests and uniquely provides foods and habitats for other species. WBP populations have undergone massive die-offs over the past decade due to pest outbreaks associated with climate warming. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), federal agencies have been working together since 1999 to develop a strategy for restoring the lost WBP forests. This project was designed to provide guidance as to how to place management treatments in the landscape to be most effective under climate change. We analyzed relationships between WBP and climate during the past 15,000 years and forecasted potential response to climate change to the year 2100. In collaboration with federal managers, we used the results to develop a management strategy to maintain a viable population of WBP in the GYE under projected future climates. Simulation modeling experiments revealed that our \u201cclimate-informed\u201d strategy is likely to be more effective under future climates than the current federal strategy.

Planning for the effects of climate change in this region is a high priority for the Plains and Prairie Pothole LCC and managers at federal, regional, and local levels (e.g. North American Waterfowl Management Plan 2012). Climate models for the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) project increasing temperatures and little to no increases in precipitation (though potentially more variability), leading to reductions in wetland habitat through increased evapotranspiration (Johnson et al. 2010). Populations of waterfowl and other species often decrease during droughts (Sorenson et al. 1998), raising concerns that hunting opportunities could be compromised and that the long-term viability of non-game populations may be at risk. Changes in climate can also have indirect effects on biodiversity by driving changes in human land use. Warmer temperatures, resulting in longer crop growing seasons and changes in crop yields, could incentivize landowners to alter their land-management practices or to transition from less intensive grassland uses to intensive row crop production (Rashford et al. 2010), which alters habitats and wetland functions (Rashford et al. 2016).

When species that are the focus of ongoing management efforts act as effective surrogates for other species, these incidental surrogacy benefits lead to additional efficiency. Assessing surrogate relationships often relies on grouping species by distributional patterns or by species traits, but there are few approaches for integrating outputs from multiple methods into summaries of surrogate relationships that can inform decision\u2010making.

Methods  We evaluated how well five upland\u2010nesting waterfowl species that are a focus of management may act as surrogates for other wetland\u2010dependent birds. We grouped species by their patterns of relative abundance at multiple scales and by different sets of traits, and evaluated whether empirical validation could effectively select among the resulting species groupings. We used an ensemble approach to integrate the different estimated relationships among species and visualized the ensemble as a network diagram.    Results  Estimated relationships among species were sensitive to methodological decisions, with qualitatively different relationships arising from different approaches.

A primary goal of this research has been to assist managers in conserving areas that will provide habitat to a broad suite of species. We considered how climate change is likely to affect land-use patterns and agricultural conversion risk. We then predicted how climate change will affect the density and distribution of wetlands under future climate conditions based on models incorporating land-use, climate models, hydrology, and distribution of wetland basins.

We examined the variation in projected vulnerability attributed to each uncertainty source. To assess extrapolation skill under a changed climate, we compared model predictions with observations from historic drought years. Uncertainty in projected vulnerability was substantial, and the largest source was that of future climate change. Large uncertainty was also attributed to climate covariate class with hydrological covariates projecting half the range loss of bioclimatic covariates or other summaries of temperature and precipitation. We found that choices based on performance in cross-validation improved skill in extrapolation. Qualitative rankings were also highly uncertain. Given uncertainty in projected vulnerability and resulting uncertainty in rankings used for conservation prioritization, a number of considerations appear critical for using bioclimatic SDMs to inform climate change mitigation strategies.

During spring migration in the U.S. Prairie Potholes, 7.3 million shorebirds refuel in the region's myriad small, freshwater wetlands. Shorebirds use mudflats, shorelines, and ephemeral wetlands that are far more abundant in wet years than dry years. Generally, climate change is expected to bring warmer temperatures, seasonality shifts, more extreme events, and changes to precipitation. The impacts to wetland habitats are uncertain. In the Prairie Potholes, earlier spring onset and warmer temperatures may advance drying of wetlands or, alternately, increased spring precipitation may produce abundant shallow\u2010water habitats. To look at the availability of habitats for migratory shorebirds under different climate regimes, we compared habitat selection between a historic wet year and a dry year using binomial random\u2010effects models to describe local and landscape patterns. We found that in the dry year shorebirds were distributed more northerly and among more permanent wetlands, whereas in the wet year shorebirds were distributed more southerly and among more temporary wetlands. However, landscape\u2010scale variation played a larger role in the dry year. At the local wetland scale, shorebirds selected similarly between years\u2014for shallower wetlands and wetlands in croplands. Overall, while shorebirds were sensitive to local habitat conditions, they exhibited a degree of adaptive capacity to climate change impacts by their ability to shift on the landscape.

To build resilience and societal preparedness towards climate change, integration of adaptation into development is being increasingly emphasized. To date, much of the adaptation literature has been theoretical, reflecting the absence of empirical data from activities on the ground. However, the Funds established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and managed by the Global Environment Facility, the Least Developed Countries Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund and the Strategic Priority for Adaptation, have approved financing for 133 adaptation projects in 70 countries with sufficient documented experience to allow for initial categorization and evaluation. This article provides the first substantial compendium of adaptation actions identified through the allocation and disbursement of these Funds and organizes these actions into a generalized typology of adaptation activities. The information obtained sheds new insight into what adaptation is, in practice, and suggests some next steps to strengthen the empirical database. Ten types of overarching adaptation activities were identified through an analysis of 92 projects financed through these Funds. This paper analyzes these adaptation activities and compares them with theoretical constructs of adaptation typologies. We find that many of the early ideas and concepts advanced by theoreticians are consistent with results from the field. The adaptation categories that recur the most in Global Environment Facility projects are enabling and relatively inexpensive measures, such as those related to capacity building, policy reform, and planning and management. However, a rich panoply of technical actions ranging from information and communications technology, to early warning systems, to new or improved infrastructure, are also identified as common project goals. Future refinements of the costs of various adaptation actions, the mixture of technical and management options, and evaluating the efficacy of actions implemented, will be key to informing the future global adaptation agenda.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/589260c1e4b072a7ac154c59", "parentId": "5228cc75e4b06291bed80699", "proj_id": "52261e88e4b07a38b633df29", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=589260c1e4b072a7ac154c59"}, "58a22aa0e4b0c82512856d29": {"title": "Adaptation: U.S. National Climate Assessment 2014", "contacts": [{"name": "Rosina Bierbaum", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Arthur Lee", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Joel Smith", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Maria Blair", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Lynne M.

Climate scientists expect the region to experience more frequent summer heat waves, longer-lasting and more frequent droughts, and decreased river flow in the future (Lukas et al. 2014). These changes will ultimately impact local communities and challenge natural resource managers in allocating water and range for livestock grazing under unpredictable drought conditions, managing forests in the face of changing fire regimes, and managing threatened species under shifting ecological conditions.  Considering the wide-ranging potential impacts of climate change in the region, the goal of this project was to collaborate with decision-makers to develop strategies to reduce those impacts on people and nature. Scientists, land managers, and local communities worked together to identify actions to reduce the negative effects of climate change. Known as \u201cadaptation strategies,\u201d these actions are expected to facilitate effective planning and management under shifting climate conditions.

Numerous algorithms have been developed to estimate phenological transition dates using time series of remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices. A key challenge, however, is that different algorithms provide inconsistent results. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) phenological transition dates estimated from 500 m MODIS data based on two widely used sources of such data: the TIMESAT program and the MODIS Global Land Cover Dynamics (MLCD) product. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of land cover class, criteria used to identify SOS and EOS, and fitting algorithm (local versus global) on the transition dates estimated from time series of MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Satellite-derived transition dates from each source are compared against each other and against SOS and EOS dates estimated from PhenoCams distributed across the Northeastern United States and Canada. Our results show that TIMESAT and MLCD SOS transition dates are generally highly correlated (r = 0.51-0.97), except in Central Canada where correlation coefficients are as low as 0.25. Relative to SOS, EOS comparison shows lower agreement and higher magnitude of deviations. SOS and EOS dates are impacted by noise arising from snow and cloud contamination, and there is low agreement among results from TIMESAT, the MLCD product, and PhenoCams in vegetation types with low seasonal EVI amplitude or with irregular EVI time series. In deciduous forests, SOS dates from the MLCD product and TIMESAT agree closely with SOS dates from PhenoCams, with correlations as high as 0.76. Overall, our results suggest that TIMESAT is well-suited for local-to-regional scale studies because of its ability to tune algorithm parameters, which makes it more flexible than the MLCD product. At large spatial scales, where local tuning is not feasible, the MLCD product provides a readily available data set based on a globally consistent approach that provides SOS and EOS dates that are comparable to results from TIMESAT.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e67ea49e4b01d50925c2051", "parentId": "5e5d34dfe4b01d50924f2c37", "proj_id": "5e5d3443e4b01d50924f2c2e", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5e67ea49e4b01d50925c2051"}, "5e67edf4e4b01d50925c2099": {"title": "Phenocams Bridge the Gap between Field and Satellite Observations in an Arid Grassland Ecosystem", "contacts": [{"name": "Dawn M.

The algorithm creates high quality times series of vegetation indices from HLS imagery, which are then used to estimate the timing of vegetation phenophase transitions at 30 m spatial resolution.

Currently, vegetation indices that largely capture changes in greenness are the most commonly used datasets in satellite-based GPP modeling. However, there remains significant uncertainty in the spatiotemporal relationship between greenness indices and GPP, especially for relatively heterogeneous dryland ecosystems. In this paper, we compared vegetation greenness indices from PhenoCam and satellite (Landsat and MODIS) observations against GPP estimates from the eddy covariance technique, across three representative ecosystem types of the southwestern United States. We systematically evaluated the changes in the relationship between vegetation greenness indices and GPP: i) across spatial scales of canopy-level, 30-meter, and 500-meter resolution; and ii) across temporal scale of daily, 8-day, 16-day, and monthly resolution. We found that greenness-GPP relationships were independent of spatial scales as long as land cover type and composition remained relatively constant. We also found that the greenness-GPP relationships became stronger as the time interval increased, with the strongest relationships observed at the monthly resolution. We posit that the greenness-GPP relationship breaks down at short timescales because greenness changes more slowly than plant physiological function, which responds rapidly to changes in key biophysical drivers.

We found 51% of the cities experienced an advanced SOS with an average of \u22126.39\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.82 days after urbanization has occurred, while the remaining 49% of the cities had a delayed SOS with an average of 7.56\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.63 days. We also found a later EOS at 53% of the cities and an earlier EOS at 47% of the cities with an average of 8.43\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.59 and \u22125.57\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.99 days between the post- and pre-urbanization periods, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis indicates that climate variables (i.e. temperature, precipitation, and insolation) play dominant roles in regulating the temporal shifts of LSP. Furthermore, the earlier SOS and later EOS were significantly correlated with the amplitude of urbanization (i.e. increase of impervious surface area) in cities after controlling for effects of climate factors. These patterns were generally consistent across eight climate zones. Our findings provide critical information in modeling natural and anthropogenic effects on urban ecosystem, with important benefits for urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e66d2b9e4b01d50925a1302", "parentId": "5e5d34dfe4b01d50924f2c37", "proj_id": "5e5d3443e4b01d50924f2c2e", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5e66d2b9e4b01d50925a1302"}, "5e67eccce4b01d50925c2073": {"title": "Intercomparison of phenological transition dates derived from the PhenoCam Dataset V1.0 and MODIS satellite remote sensing", "contacts": [{"name": "Andrew D.

Near-surface sensing using digital repeat photography has proven to be useful for ecosystem-scale monitoring of vegetation phenology. However, our understanding of the link between phenological metrics derived from digital repeat photography and the phenology of forest canopy photosynthesis is still incomplete, especially for evergreen plant species. Using 49 site-years of digital images from the PhenoCam Network from eight evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF) and six deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) sites in North America, we explored the potential of the green chromatic (GCC) and red chromatic coordinates (RCC) in tracking forest canopy photosynthesis by comparing camera-derived start- and end-of-growing season (SOS and EOS, respectively) with corresponding estimates derived from eddy covariance-derived daily gross primary productivity (GPP). We found that for DBF sites, both GCC and RCC performed comparable in capturing SOS and EOS. However, similar to earlier studies, GCC had limited potential in capturing GPP-based SOS or EOS for ENF sites. In contrast, we found RCC was a better predictor of both GPP-based SOS and EOS for ENF sites. Environmental and ecological explanations were both provided that phenological transitions derived from RCC were highly correlated with spring and autumn meteorological conditions, as well as having overall higher correlations with phenology based on LAI, a critical variable for describing canopy development. Our results demonstrate that RCC is an underappreciated metric for tracking vegetation phenology, especially for ENF sites where GCC failed to provide reliable estimates for GPP-based SOS or EOS. Our results improve confidence in using digital repeat photography to characterize the phenology of canopy photosynthesis across forest types.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e3aefeae4b0edb47bddac4e", "parentId": "589cb8d6e4b0efcedb763463", "proj_id": "589cb7a7e4b0efcedb7626f0", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5e3aefeae4b0edb47bddac4e"}, "5a69016be4b06e28e9c72402": {"title": "Final Report for Building Collaboration between the North Central CSC and Regional Partners through Liaison Teams", "contacts": [{"name": "Geneva W Chong", "type": "Author", "email": "geneva_chong@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0003-3883-5153"}], "casc": "North Central CASC", "fy": "2016", "summary": "The Liaison Project increased communications between the North Central Climate Science Center (NC CSC), other USGS Science Centers and potential collaborators including active members of the four Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCC) included in the NC CSC area.

In this study, we perform the first multi-species comparison of two widely used metrics of PET i.e., Penman-Monteith and Thornthwaite, and show how they result in similar or different on projected distribution of water limited species and potential consequences on their conservation strategies across North Central U.S. To build species distribution models of eight species, we used two sets of environmental predictors which were identical except for the metric of PET (Penman-Monthith vs Thornthwaite) and projected habitat suitability for historical (2005) and future (0399) periods. We found an excellent model performance with no difference under two sets of predictors (AUC + ~0.93). The relative influence of Thornthwaite PET on habitat prediction was higher than Penman PET for most of the species. We observered that the area of the projected suitable habitat was always higher under Thornthwaite set of predictors which were than Penman set of predictors (ranges from 25% to 941%), with the exception of Pinus contorta for which the reverse was true. In most cases, these differences were non-trivial, indicating that the choice of the PET metric, although both of them are commonly used, can have dramatic consequences on the conservation management decisions.

In the past century, global temperatures have risen an average of 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, a trend that is expected to only accelerate. But public sentiment has taken a long time to catch up, and we are only just beginning to acknowledge the serious effects this will have on all life on Earth. The federal government is crafting broad-scale strategies to protect wildland ecosystems from the worst effects of climate change. The challenge now is to get the latest science into the hands of resource managers entrusted with protecting water, plants, fish and wildlife, tribal lands, and cultural heritage sites in wildlands.  Teaming with NASA and the Department of the Interior, ecologist Andrew Hansen, along with his team of scientists and managers, set out to understand how climate and land use changes affect montane landscapes of the Rockies and the Appalachians, and how these findings can be applied to wildlands elsewhere. They examine changes over the past century as well as expected future change, assess the vulnerability of species and ecosystems to these changes, and provide new, collaborative management approaches to mitigate expected impacts. A series of case studies showcases how managers might tackle such wide-ranging problems as the effects of warming streams on cold-water fish in Great Smoky Mountain National Park and dying white-bark pine stands in the Greater Yellowstone area. A surprising finding is that species and ecosystems vary dramatically in vulnerability to climate change. While many will suffer severe effects, others may actually benefit from projected changes.  Climate Change in Wildlands is a collaboration between scientists and managers, providing a science-derived framework and common-sense approaches for keeping parks and protected areas healthy on a rapidly changing planet. - See more at: http://www.islandpress.org/book/climate-change-in-wildlands#sthash.ZdEUAf26.dpuf", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/566b661ae4b09cfe53ca58cd", "parentId": "545a8957e4b009f8aec980a0", "proj_id": "54247fc9e4b037b608f9ede3", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=566b661ae4b09cfe53ca58cd"}, "5a96f008e4b06990606c4fb9": {"title": "Final Report for Foundational Science Area: Assessing Climate Change Impacts to Wildlife and Habitats in the North Central U.S.", "contacts": [{"name": "Arjun  Adhikari", "type": "Author", "email": "arjun.adhikari@montana.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Andrew Hansen", "type": "Author", "email": "hansen@montana.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "North Central CASC", "fy": "2014", "summary": "Rates of climate and land use change vary across the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains as do the responses of ecosystems to these changes.

Species distribution models have become a widely used tool to generate first-pass estimates of climate change impacts to species probabilities of occurrence. There are a number of technical challenges to constructing species distribution models that can be alleviated by the use of scientific workflow software. These challenges include data integration, visualization of modeled predictor\u2013response relationships, and ensuring that models are reproducible and transferable in an adaptive natural resource management framework. We used freely available software called VisTrails Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling ( VisTrails:SAHM) along with a novel ecohydrological predictor dataset and the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 future climate projections to construct species distribution models for eight forest and shrub species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the Northern Rocky Mountains USA. The species considered included multiple species of sagebrush and juniper,  Pinus flexilis,  Pinus contorta,  Pseudotsuga menziesii,  Populus tremuloides,  Abies lasciocarpa, Picea engelmannii, and  Pinus albicaulis. Current and future species probabilities of occurrence were mapped in a GIS by land ownership category to assess the feasibility of undertaking present and future management action. Results suggested that decreasing spring snowpack and increasing late-season soil moisture deficit will lead to deteriorating habitat area for mountain forest species and expansion of habitat area for sagebrush and juniper communities. Results were consistent across nine global climate models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios.

However, integrating the additional impacts of climate change into STSMs remains a challenge. We address this challenge by combining an STSM with species distribution modeling (SDM). SDMs estimate the probability of occurrence of a given species based on observed presence and absence locations as well as environmental and climatic covariates. Thus, in order to account for changes in habitat suitability due to climate change, we used SDM to generate continuous surfaces of species occurrence probabilities. These data were imported into ST-Sim, an STSM platform, where they dictated the probability of each cell transitioning between alternate potential vegetation types at each time step. The STSM was parameterized to capture additional processes of vegetation growth and disturbance that are relevant to a keystone species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem\u2014whitebark pine ( Pinus albicaulis). We compared historical model runs against historical observations of whitebark pine and a key disturbance agent (mountain pine beetle,  Dendroctonus ponderosae), and then projected the simulation into the future. Using this combination of correlative and stochastic simulation models, we were able to reproduce historical observations and identify key data gaps.

There is a need to critically examine diverse climate change risks for indigenous peoples in the United States and the many structural barriers that limit their ability to adapt to climate change. This paper uses a sustainable climate adaptation framework to outline the context and the relationships of power and authority, along with different ways of knowing and meaning, to illustrate the underpinnings of some tribes\u2019 barriers to sustainable climate adaptation. The background of those structural barriers for tribes is traced, and then the case of water rights and management at the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming is used to illustrate the interplay of policy, culture, climate, justice, and limits to adaptation. Included is a discussion about how the rulings of the Big Horn general stream adjudication have hindered tribal climate change adaptation by limiting the quantity of tribal reserved water rights, tying those rights to the sole purposes of agriculture, which undermines social and cultural connections to the land and water, and failing to recognizing tribal rights to groundwater. Future climate projections suggest increasing temperatures, and changes in the amount and timing of snowpack, along with receding glaciers, all of which impact water availability downstream.

This report contains the initial findings of this project, and details work conducted between 2015 and 2017 centered around three main questions: 1. What efforts are currently underway within the Colorado BLM to address changes in climate and the climate vulnerabilities of public land users? 2. What are the characteristics of connections between public lands and communities across the state? 3. How are land-based livelihoods (such as ranching and recreational outfitting) that rely upon public land resources affected by changes in long-term weather patterns, extreme events, and associated BLM decision-making? To answer these questions, we took a mixed-methods approach. To better understand existing work on climate change within the Colorado BLM, we extensively reviewed existing resource management plans, resource advisory council notes, and other policy documents. In order to establish a state-wide view of patterns of communities, their characteristics, and their connection to BLM-managed resources, we conducted a geospatial analysis of multiple publicly available socio-demographic and economic datasets, as well as numerous BLM field office records on usage patterns and intensity. Finally, we also conducted two in-depth, qualitative case studies in two field office management areas with well-known connections to public land resources. Here, we used interviews with BLM staff, grazing permittees, recreational outfitters, and other business operators with ties to BLM-managed lands to better understand how climate hazards and shifts in seasonal weather patterns play out on the ground for public land users and the numerous communities across the state whose economies are closely linked to public land management policy.

We analyzed Colorado BLM planning documents to evaluate how they are considering climate change, sensitive resources, impacts, and land-based livelihoods in their planning processes using both quantitative word counts and qualitative coding. Documents published in recent years (2011\u20132015) include more mentions of climate change than older documents (1985\u20131997). However, the review showed that while climate change is discussed within the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning documents, the final Resource Management Plans contain few mentions of climate change. Further, there is minimal consideration of how climate change may impact land-based livelihoods. These results prompt questions about the planning process, how climate change considerations are integrated into the final documents, and how that impacts on-the-ground management.

The assessments presented herein present a statewide perspective on the potential future influences of a changing climate on species and ecosystems of particular importance to the BLM, with the goal of facilitating development of the best possible climate adaptation strategies to meet future conditions.

We examine sources of uncertainty arising from the methodological choices for the assessment of future drought risk in the continental US (CONUS). One such uncertainty is in the climate models\u2019 expression of evaporative demand (E0), which is not a direct climate model output but has been traditionally estimated using several different formulations. Here we analyze daily output from two CMIP5 GCMs to evaluate how differences in E0 formulation, treatment of meteorological driving data, choice of GCM, and standardization of time series influence the estimation of E0. These methodological choices yield different assessments of spatio-temporal variability in E0 and different trends in 21st century drought risk. First, we estimate E0 using three widely used E0 formulations: Penman-Monteith; Hargreaves-Samani; and Priestley-Taylor. Our analysis, which primarily focuses on the May-September warm-season period, shows that E0 climatology and its spatial pattern differ substantially between these three formulations. Overall, we find higher magnitudes of E0 and its interannual variability using Penman-Monteith, in particular for regions like the Great Plains and southwestern US where E0 is strongly influenced by variations in wind and relative humidity. When examining projected changes in E0 during the 21st century, there are also large differences among the three formulations, particularly the Penman-Monteith relative to the other two formulations. The 21st century E0 trends, particularly in percent change and standardized anomalies of E0, are found to be sensitive to the long-term mean value and the amplitude of interannual variability, i.e. if the magnitude of E0 and its interannual variability are relatively low for a particular E0 formulation, then the normalized or standardized 21st century trend based on that formulation is amplified relative to other formulations. This is the case for the use of Hargreaves-Samani and Priestley-Taylor, where future E0 trends are comparatively much larger than for Penman-Monteith. When comparing Penman-Monteith E0 responses between different choices of input variables related to wind speed, surface roughness, and net radiation, we found differences in E0 trends, although these choices had a much smaller influence on E0 trends than did the E0 formulation choices. These methodological choices and specific climate model selection, also have a large influence on the estimation of trends in standardized drought indices used for drought assessment operationally. We find that standardization tends to amplify divergences between the E0 trends calculated using different E0 formulations, because standardization is sensitive to both the climatology and amplitude of interannual variability of E0. For different methodological choices and GCM output considered in estimating E0, we examine potential sources of uncertainty in 21st century trends in the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) over selected regions of the CONUS to demonstrate the practical implications of these methodological choices for the quantification of drought risk under climate change.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58cafd16e4b0849ce97c8bbf", "parentId": "54248085e4b037b608f9edf9", "proj_id": "54247fb5e4b037b608f9edd9", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=58cafd16e4b0849ce97c8bbf"}, "58921368e4b072a7ac12fceb": {"title": "High-Resolution Climate Modeling for Regional Adaptation", "contacts": [{"name": "Imtiaz Rangwala", "type": "Author", "email": "imtiaz.rangwala@colorado.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Candida Dewes", "type": "Author", "email": "candida.dewes@noaa.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Joseph Barsugli", "type": "Author", "email": "joseph.barsugli@colorado.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "North Central CASC", "fy": "2014", "summary": "Climate policy developers and natural resource managers frequently desire high-resolution climate data to prepare for future effects of climate change.

The appeal of LST as a spatial predictor of air temperature rests in the fact that it is an observation available at spatial resolutions fine enough to capture topoclimatic and biophysical variations. However, it remains unclear if LST improves air temperature interpolations over what can already be obtained with simpler terrain-based predictor variables. Here, the relationship between LST and air temperature is evaluated across the conterminous United States (CONUS). It is found that there are significant differences in the ability of daytime and nighttime observations of LST to improve air temperature interpolations. Daytime LST mainly indicates finescale biophysical variation and is generally a poorer predictor of maximum air temperature than simple linear models based on elevation, longitude, and latitude. Moderate improvements to maximum air temperature interpolations are thus limited to specific mountainous areas in winter, to coastal areas, and to semiarid and arid regions where daytime LST likely captures variations in evaporative cooling and aridity. In contrast, nighttime LST represents important topoclimatic variation throughout the mountainous western CONUS and significantly improves nighttime minimum air temperature interpolations. In regions of more homogenous terrain, nighttime LST also captures biophysical patterns related to land cover.

Four independently managed and geographically separated National Park Service (NPS) units in Interior Region 5 (IR5) preserve bison and other components of a formerly contiguous Great Plains landscape. Management of bison in IR5 parks has historically been specific to each park, and livestock and range management science informed much of the decision making. In the past two decades, NPS has shifted away from managing bison from this livestock-based perspective towards a wildlife stewardship approach, including ensuring their long-term adaptive potential and considering them as just one part of a complex ecosystem. This shift requires a more holistic and cooperative approach to stewardship that is challenging not only because of limitations in funding and fluctuations in leadership priorities, but also because of the constraints imposed by the parks\u2019 relatively small, fenced areas. The IR5 NPS Bison Stewardship Strategy (\u201cStrategy\u201d) will help the NPS to meet its responsibilities in cooperative stewardship of bison.

Federal and State natural resource managers can no longer rely solely on historical trends as a baseline and thus are in need of science that is relevant to their specific needs to inform important planning decisions. Questions remain, however, regarding the most effective and efficient methods for extending scientific knowledge and products into management and decision-making. This project analyzed two unique cases of water management to better understand how science can be translated into resource management actions and decision-making, focusing particularly on how the context of how drought influences ecosystems. In particular, this project sought to understand (1) the characteristics that make science actionable and useful for water resource management and drought preparedness, and (2) the ideal types of scientific knowledge or science products that facilitate the use of science in management and decision making. The first case study focused on beaver mimicry, an emerging nature-based solution that increases the presence of wood and woody debris in rivers and streams to mimic the actions of beavers. This technique has been rapidly adopted by natural resource managers as a way to restore riparian areas, reconnect incised streams with their floodplains, increase groundwater infiltration, and slow surface water flow so that more water is available later in the year during hotter and drier months (Pollock and others 2015). The second case study focused on an established research program, Colorado Dust on Snow, that provides water managers with scientific information explaining how the movement of dust particles from the Colorado Plateau influences hydrology and the timing and intensity of snow melt and water runoff into critical water sources. This program has support from \u2013 and is being used by \u2013 several water conservation districts in Colorado. Understanding how scientific knowledge translates into action and decision-making in these cases is useful to strengthen knowledge of actionable science for drought management. The project team gathered qualitative data through stakeholder conversations and conducted an extensive literature review.

The region contains millions of wetlands that produce between 50\u201380% of the continent\u2019s waterfowl population each year. Previous modeling efforts indicated that climate change would result in a shift of suitable waterfowl breeding habitat from the central PPR to the southeast portion of the region where over half of wetlands have been drained. The implications of adopting these projections would require a massive investment in wetland restoration in the southeastern PPR to sustain migratory waterfowl populations at harvestable levels. We revisited these projections using a newly developed model for simulating prairie-pothole wetland hydrology in combination with the most up-to-date climate model projections to estimate how future climate may impact the distribution of waterfowl-breeding habitat. We also presented our findings in changes to wet May ponds, which is a metric that is used by managers at the US Fish and Wildlife Service to estimate waterfowl breeding populations to establish harvest regulations. Based on the output of 32 climate models and 2 emission scenarios we found a projected change in wet May pond numbers from -23% to +.02% when comparing the most recent climate period (1989\u20132018) to the end of the 21st century (2070\u20132099). We also found no evidence that the distribution of wet May ponds will shift in the future. These results suggest that management and conservation strategies for wetlands in the PPR that focus on areas with the high densities of intact wetland basins support  large numbers of breeding duck pairs and will likely be the most successful in maintaining habitats critical to continental waterfowl populations.\" ", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e012601e4b0b207aa033e8d", "parentId": "5b4e0a05e4b06a6dd17df05e", "proj_id": "5b33be6fe4b040769c172fad", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5e012601e4b0b207aa033e8d"}, "5ea87c9182cefae35a1faece": {"title": "Mapping Climate Change Resistant Vernal Pools in the Northeastern U.S.", "contacts": [{"name": "Jennifer Cartwright", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Evan Grant", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Toni Lyn Morelli", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2017", "summary": "Abstract from NE CASC: Vernal pools are small, seasonal wetlands that provide critically important seasonal habitat for many amphibian species of conservation concern.

We analyzed a long-term dataset (1981\u20132015) of biweekly water temperature data in six temperate lakes in Wisconsin, U.S.A. to understand (1) variability in monthly rates of surface- and deep-water warming, (2) how those rates compared to summertime average trends, and (3) if monthly heterogeneity in water temperature trends can be predicted by heterogeneity in air temperature trends.

If these assumptions are incorrect, results and therefore inference may be biased and uncertainty underestimated. We developed a novel statistical method to account for spatiotemporal correlations within dendritic stream networks, while accounting for imperfect detection in the surveys. Through simulations, we found this model decreased predictive error relative to standard statistical methods when data were spatially correlated based on stream distance and performed similarly when data were not correlated. We found that increasing the number of years surveyed substantially improved the model accuracy when estimating spatial and temporal correlation coefficients, especially from 10 to 15 yr. Increasing the number of survey sites within the network improved the performance of the nonspatial model but only marginally improved the density estimates in the spatiotemporal model. We applied this model to brook trout data from the West Susquehanna Watershed in Pennsylvania collected over 34 yr from 1981 to 2014. We found the model including temporal and spatiotemporal autocorrelation best described young of the year (YOY) and adult density patterns.

Through our direct work with Tribes we were able to provide temporary support as Tribes either started or continued climate adaptation planning work. The process was initially focused on working with Tribal decision making bodies (e.g. Natural Resource Departments, Conservation Commissions) but also worked within community activities to the extent requested by the Tribal representatives. In addition, we worked with Tribal students and professionals who participated in other events such as, a Tribal Climate Camp, Indigenous Planning Summer Institute, and a Tribally led regional climate change monitoring network. In all cases, the effort to provide necessary information to advance Tribal climate adaptation planning needs resulted in the identification of specific resource issues.

The heterogeneous canopy emulates the mid-successional forest at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS).

This project\u2019s research specifically investigates how restoring floodplains would impact human welfare and environmental conservation. Its research objectives are addressed in two parts: 1) developing a hydraulic model to illustrate how changes in floodplain management may impact flooding along the Connecticut River, and 2) developing a geo-spatial model that demonstrates the distribution and abundance of sandbars along the Connecticut River and its tributaries.  Floodplains retain water, an ecosystem service that naturally mitigates flood impacts on human communities living along major rivers. The hydraulic model developed for this project analyzes the flooding impacts of eight scenarios that vary in their ratio of land-use (forested land to field land) within a floodplain. Study findings suggest that as floodplain restoration efforts increase, flood peaks decrease downstream and habitat suitability improves. Restoration leads to reduced flood risk for downstream inhabitants, however, the number of impacted people residing directly in the upstream floodplain can increase. Flood flow duration can also increase expanding the available suitable land for restoration focused efforts. Alternatively, as development in the upstream floodplain grows, flood events increase flood risk for downstream inhabitants, while habitat suitability diminishes and the impact to floodplain residents decreases. Sandbars and islands in lowland rivers form when sediment (silt, sand, and gravel) is deposited in places where the stream velocity decreases.  Sandbars and islands are the preceding habitats that evolve into floodplains. Their distribution and abundance provide information about sediment transport and flow in 2 a river, both of which influence flood risk to neighboring human communities. This study develops a spatial model to track changes in these habitats in the Connecticut River watershed, allowing for the comparison of their distribution and abundance currently and around times of storms and extreme flooding. The developed tool is effective in quantifying critical river habitat and identifying key river and floodplain areas for conservation at large scales.

For the mainstem, sandbar area decreased towards the mouth but with three increases of sandbars due to meandering and major tributary confluences of the White and Deerfield rivers. Dams tend to decrease sandbars downstream but the effect of dams is context specific. Sandbars are stored upstream of the impoundment on the Black River as expected, sandbars appear downstream of a dam on the mainstem if a tributary confluence is present.

One such forest ecosystem service is maple syrup, which is primarily derived from Acer saccharum(sugar maple), currently an abundant and widespread tree species in eastern North America. Two climate sensitive components of sap affect syrup production: sugar content and sap flow. The sugar in maple sap derives from carbohydrate stores influenced by prior year growing season conditions. Sap flow is tied to freeze/thaw cycles during early spring. Predicting climate effects on syrup production thus requires integrating observations across scales and biological processes. We observed sap at 6 sugar maple stands spanning sugar maple\u2019s latitudinal range over 2\u20136\u202fyears to predict the role of climate variation on sugar content and sap flow. We found that the timing of sap collection advanced by 4.3\u202fdays for every 1\u202f\u00b0C increase in March mean temperature, sap volume peaked at a January-May mean temperature of 1\u202f\u00b0C, and sap sugar content declined by 0.1 \u00b0Brix for every 1\u202f\u00b0C increase in previous May-October mean temperature. Using these empirical relationships, we projected that the sap collection season midpoint will be 1\u202fmonth earlier and sap sugar content will decline by 0.7 \u00b0Brix across sugar maple\u2019s range by the year 2100 in an RCP 8.5 climate change scenario. The region of maximum sap flow is expected to shift northward by 400\u202fkm, from near the 43rd parallel to the 48th parallel by 2100. Our findings suggest climate change will have profound effects on syrup yield across most of sugar maple\u2019s range; drastic shifts in the timing of the tapping season accompanied by flat to moderate increases in syrup yield per tap in Canada contrast with declines in syrup yield and higher frequencies of poor syrup production years across most of the U.S. range.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d0a589fe4b0e3d3115fac10", "parentId": "551b01e0e4b0323842783949", "proj_id": "5519b3e7e4b0323842783302", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5d0a589fe4b0e3d3115fac10"}, "59692a24e4b0d1f9f05fbd36": {"title": "Acer Climate and Socio-Ecological Research Network (ACERnet)", "contacts": [{"name": "Northeast CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Northeast CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "The Acer Climate and Socio-Ecological Research Network (ACERnet) is an international consortium of scientists studying climate impacts on sugar maple and maple syrup production.

Native American tribes have collected and boiled down sap for centuries, and the tapping of maple trees is a cultural touchstone for many people in the northeast and Midwest. Because the tapping season is dependent on weather conditions, there is concern about the sustainability of maple sugaring as climate changes throughout the region. At the same time the demand for this natural sweetener and the production of maple syrup are increasing rapidly. Our research addressed the impact of climate on the quality of maple sap used to make maple syrup. We examined yields coupled with the sugar and biochemical composition of sap collected throughout the geographic range of sugar maple in the northeastern USA and Canada, and related this to historical and projected variation in climate. This is the first study to document potential climate related changes in sap production and sap quality across the full geographic range of sugar maple. Declines, as well as increased variability, in sap flow near the southern range limit and increased sap flow at the northern range limit suggest long term range shifts toward the north, as well as geographic variation in expected syrup production over the next several decades. Survey results highlighted that producers do perceive changes in climate variables and concomitant shifts in sap production.

Objectives  We highlight milestones in the development of forest dynamics models and identify future research and application opportunities.    Methods  We reviewed milestones in the evolution of forest dynamics models from the 1930s to the present with emphasis on forest growth and yield models and forest landscape models We combined past trends with emerging issues to identify future needs.    Results  Historically, capacity to model forest dynamics at tree, stand, and landscape scales was constrained by available data for model calibration and validation; computing capacity; model applicability to real-world problems; and ability to integrate biological, social, and economic drivers of change. As computing and data resources improved, a new class of spatially explicit forest landscape models emerged.    Conclusions  We are at a point of great opportunity in development and application of forest dynamics models. Past limitations in computing capacity and in data suitable for model calibration or evaluation are becoming less restrictive. Forest landscape models, in particular, are ready to transition to a central role supporting forest management, planning, and policy decisions.    Recommendations  Transitioning forest landscape models to a central role in applied decision making will require greater attention to evaluating performance; building application support staffs; expanding the included drivers of change, and incorporating metrics for social and economic inputs and outputs.

We applied a landscape modeling approach that incorporated three levels of spatial hierarchy (pixel, landtype, and ecological subsection) to model regional-scale shifts in forest composition under climate change.    Objective  To determine (1) how importance value of individual species will change under the PCM B1 and GFDL A1FI modeling scenarios and (2) how overall forest composition at different spatial scales will change under these climate change scenarios in the short, medium, and long term in the Central Hardwood Forest Region (CHFR).

Results  Shifts in forest composition were greater under the GFDL A1FI than the PCM B1 modeling scenarios and were greatest at the scale of ecological sections followed by forest sub-regions and the whole CHFR. Forest composition shifted toward more southern and xeric species and lesser northern and mesic species.

Given that flooding may increase with climate change and reforestation will increase resiliency to climate change, we tested whether reforested floodplains also have great potential to store carbon and the effects of even modest increases in forested acreage on carbon storage. To calculate potential aboveground biomass in the Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (LMAV) of the United States, we determined current and historical tree biomass used density estimates and diameter distributions from tree surveys and relationships between diameter and biomass from current forests. To calculate potential soil organic carbon if the landscape was forested, we used soil organic matter from soil surveys of the agricultural landscape, and multiplied the carbon by a factors of 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 based on published reports of soil carbon increases due to afforestation. Our results showed that area-weighted mean biomass density (trees \u226512.7 cm in diameter) for historical forests was 300 Mg/ha, ranging from 228 Mg/ha to 332 Mg/ha by ecological subsection, based on the most conservative diameter distribution. Mean biomass density for current forests was 97 Mg/ha, ranging from 92 Mg/ha to 111 Mg/ha. Mean carbon density for agricultural soils was 96 Mg/ha, whereas combined tree and soil carbon densities varied from 169 Mg/ha to 317 Mg/ha; soil carbon accounted for 0.5\u20130.7 of total carbon density. Historical forested carbon storage in the Missouri LMAV was about 234 TgC, with the most conservative diameter distribution and assuming 80% forest coverage. Current forested carbon storage in the Missouri LMAV is about 2% of historical storage, at 5 TgC in 30,000 ha of forests, but may reach 23 TgC if forested extent almost triples, with the addition of 50,000 ha of marginal agricultural land, and carbon storage increases in trees and soil. The entire LMAV currently stores 97 TgC in forests and reasonable carbon storage for the entire LMAV may be about 335 TgC, based on increased carbon storage and reforestation of 600,000 ha of marginal agricultural land, which would double the current forested extent.

Understanding model agreement across hierarchical scales provides perspective on prediction uncertainty and ultimately enables policy makers and managers to make better decisions.    Objective  Our objective was to test the hypothesis that agreement between process and species distribution models varies by hierarchical level. Due to the top-down approach of species distribution models and the bottom-up approach of process models, the most agreement will occur at the mid-level of the hierarchical analysis, the ecological subsection level, capturing the effects of soil variables.    Methods  We compared projections of a species distribution model, Climate Change Tree Atlas, and a process model, LINKAGES 2.2. We conducted a correlation analysis between the models at regional, ecological subsection, and species level hierarchical scales.    Results  Both models had significant positive correlation (\u03c1 = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001) on the regional scale. The majority of the ecological subsections had greater model correlation than on the regional level when all climate scenarios were pooled. Correlation was poorest for the analysis of individual species. Models had the greatest correlation at the regional scale for the GFDL-A1fi scenario (the scenario with the most climate change).

Objective  We addressed how aboveground biomass (AGB) and tree species distribution changed under multiple climate change scenarios (PCM B1, CGCM A2, and GFDL A1FI) in northeastern forests.    Methods  We used the LANDIS PRO forest landscape model to simulate forest succession and tree harvest under current climate and three climate change scenarios from 2000 to 2300. We analyzed the effects of climate change on AGB and tree species distribution.    Results  AGB increased from 2000 to 2120 irrespective of climate scenario, followed by slight decline, but then increased again to 2300. AGB averaged 10 % greater in the CGCM A2 and GFDL A1FI scenarios than the PCM B1 and current climate scenarios. Climate change effects on tree species distribution were not evident from 2000 to 2100 but by 2300 some northern hardwood and conifer species decreased in occurrence and some central hardwood and southern tree species increased in occurrence.    Conclusions  Climate change had positive effects on forest biomass under the two climate scenarios with greatest warming but the patterns in AGB over time were similar among climate scenarios because succession was the primary driver of AGB dynamics.

Methods We used a forest dynamic model, LANDIS PRO that accounted for population dynamics, tree harvest, and climate change to predict tree species\u2019 distributions at 270 m resolution from 2000 to 2300. We quantified the relative importance of these factors using a repeated measures analysis of variance. We further investigated the effects of each factor on changes in species distributions by summarizing extinction and colonization rates. Results On average, population dynamics was the most important factor affecting tree species distribution changes. Tree harvest was more important than climate change by 2100 whereas climate change was more important than harvest by 2300.

Within forest landscape models site-level fire effects are often simplified to the species, functional type, or cohort level due to time or computational resource limitations. In this study we used a subset of publicly available U.S. Forest Service forest inventory data (FIA) to estimate short-term fire effects on tree densities across multiple stem diameter classes in two ecological sections in the central and southern United States. We found that FIA plots where low-intensity fires occurred within the preceding five years in the Ozark Highlands ecological section had significantly reduced stem densities in the two smallest diameter classes and in the Gulf Coastal Plains and Flatwoods fire reduced stem densities in the three smallest diameter classes.

When representative landscapes from both study areas were simulated under a low-intensity fire regime using a forest landscape model the logistic regression probability method of modeling fire effects produced a similar reduction in stem densities while the previous age-cohort method overestimated density reductions across diameter classes.

Shrinking ranges and population declines are attributed to widespread habitat loss and increasingly fragmented landscapes of agriculture and other land uses that are misaligned with grassland bird conservation. Concurrent with habitat loss and degradation, temperate grasslands have been disproportionally affected by climate change relative to most other terrestrial biomes. Distributions of grassland birds often correlate with gradients in climate, but few researchers have explored the consequences of weather on the demography of grassland birds inhabiting a range of grassland fragments. To do so, we modeled the effects of temperature and precipitation on nesting success rates of 12 grassland bird species inhabiting a range of grassland patches across North America (21,000 nests from 81 individual studies). Higher amounts of precipitation in the preceding year were associated with higher nesting success, but wetter conditions during the active breeding season reduced nesting success. Extremely cold or hot conditions during the early breeding season were associated with lower rates of nesting success. The direct and indirect influence of temperature and precipitation on nesting success was moderated by grassland patch size. The positive effects of precipitation in the preceding year on nesting success were strongest in relatively small grassland patches and had little effect in large patches.

Grassland birds are particularly vulnerable to this variability, yet have failed to shift poleward in response to recent climate change like other bird species in North America. However, there have been few studies examining the effect of weather on grassland bird demography and consequent influence of climate change on population persistence and distributional shifts.    Objectives  The goal of this study was to estimate the vulnerability of Henslow\u2019s Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii), an obligate grassland bird that has been declining throughout much of its range, to past and future climatic variability.    Methods  We conducted a demographic meta-analysis from published studies and quantified the relationship between nest success rates and variability in breeding season climate. We projected the climate-demography relationships spatially, throughout the breeding range, and temporally, from 1981 to 2050. These projections were used to evaluate population dynamics by implementing a spatially explicit population model.    Results  We uncovered a climate-demography linkage for Henslow\u2019s Sparrow with summer precipitation, and to a lesser degree, temperature positively affecting nest success. We found that future climatic conditions\u2014primarily changes in precipitation\u2014will likely contribute to reduced population persistence and a southwestward range contraction.

For grassland birds, climate change is likely to exacerbate environmental threats such as habitat loss due to shifting agricultural practices and housing sprawl. Our goal was to identify how certain grassland bird species are sensitive to climate variability and which regions have the highest level of exposure to future climate change. To do so, we convened a core group of managers to identify vulnerable grassland bird species, developed models to estimate how climate change may impact future grassland bird populations, and identified how current grassland bird management and conservation might lessen the impacts of future climate change impacts. Using this approach, we successfully organized an initial meeting of managers and identified two species, Henslow\u2019s Sparrows and Bobolinks, as species that are of managerial interest and may be vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation.

The chronosequence and plot remeasurement approaches used to establish the decline pattern suffer from limitations and coarse temporal detail. We combined annual tree ring measurements and mortality models to address two questions: first, how do assumptions about tree growth and mortality influence reconstructions of biomass growth? Second, under what circumstances does biomass production follow the model that peaks early, then declines? We integrated three stochastic mortality models with a census tree-ring data set from eight temperate forest types to reconstruct stand-level biomass increments (in Minnesota, USA). We compared growth patterns among mortality models, forest types and stands. Timing of peak biomass growth varied significantly among mortality models, peaking 20\u201330 years earlier when mortality was random with respect to tree growth and size, than when mortality favored slow-growing individuals. Random or u-shaped mortality (highest in small or large trees) produced peak growth 25\u201330 % higher than the surviving tree sample alone.

As the climate warms in New England, USA, high-elevation boreal forests are expected to recede upslope, with northern hardwood species moving up behind. Yet recent empirical studies present conflicting findings on this dynamic, reporting both rapid upward ecotonal shifts and concurrent increases in boreal species within the region. These discrepancies may result from the limited spatial extent of observations. We developed a method to model and map the montane forest ecotone using Landsat imagery to observe change at scales not possible for plot-based studies, covering mountain peaks over 39 000 km2. Our results show that ecotones shifted downward or stayed stable on most mountains between 1991 and 2010, but also shifted upward in some cases (13\u201315% slopes).

Results from nonparametric random forests models indicated that variables which formed the PFT profile contributed to explaining broad-scale patterns in the variability in forest structure (volume and biomass of overstory live trees, maximum stand density index, and tree seedling abundance;   R2  ranged from 0.09 to 0.78), production (volume [  R2  = 0.16] and biomass accretion [  R2  = 0.11]), and to a lesser degree, tree mortality. Despite the variability in the data employed and the variety of forest management regimes in these stands, this work demonstrates the utility of applying PFT profiles for understanding and predicting patterns of forest structure and production and their role in critical ecosystem processes such as carbon sequestration.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/541c2cebe4b0e96537df1a8d", "parentId": "5213c934e4b0b08f4461a3cc", "proj_id": "52138ccbe4b0b08f44619bd9", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=541c2cebe4b0e96537df1a8d"}, "5900aefbe4b0c2e071a84b0a": {"title": "Final Report for A decision support mapper for conserving stream fish habitats of the Northeast Climate Science Center region", "contacts": [{"name": "Wesley M.

This hypothesis, often credited to Charles Darwin, is a pattern widely assumed to occur in nature. However, abiotic factors can impose constraints on both limits and there is scant evidence to support the latter prediction. Deviations from these predictions may arise from correlations between abiotic factors and biotic interactions, as a lack of data to evaluate the hypothesis, or be an artifact of scale. Combining two tenets of ecology\u2014niche theory and predator\u2013prey theory\u2014provides an opportunity to understand how biotic interactions influence range limits and how this varies by trophic level. \tWe propose an expansion of RLT, interactive RLT (iRLT), to understand the causes of range limits and predict range shifts. Incorporating the main predictions of Darwin's hypothesis, iRLT hypothesizes that abiotic and biotic factors can interact to impact both limits of a species\u2019 range. We summarize current thinking on range limits and perform an integrative review to evaluate support for iRLT and trophic differences along range margins, surveying the mammal community along the boreal\u2010temperate and forest\u2010tundra ecotones of North America. \tOur review suggests that range\u2010limit dynamics are more nuanced and interactive than classically predicted by RLT. Many (57 of 70) studies indicate that biotic factors can ameliorate harsh climatic conditions along high\u2010latitude/altitude limits. Conversely, abiotic factors can also mediate biotic interactions along low\u2010latitude/altitude limits (44 of 68 studies). Both scenarios facilitate range expansion, contraction or stability depending on the strength and the direction of the abiotic or biotic factors. As predicted, biotic interactions most often occurred along lower limits, yet there were trophic differences. Carnivores were only limited by competitive interactions (n = 25), whereas herbivores were more influenced by predation and parasitism (77%; 55 of 71 studies). We highlight how these differences may create divergent range patterns along lower limits. \tWe conclude by (a) summarizing iRLT; (b) contrasting how our model system and others fit this hypothesis and (c) suggesting future directions for evaluating iRLT.

We used multiseason correlated detection occupancy models, which avoid these assumptions, to relate climate data to distributional shifts of Louisiana Waterthrush in the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. We summarized these shifts with indices of range size and position and compared them to the same indices obtained using more basic modeling approaches. Detection rates during point counts in BBS surveys were low, and models that ignored imperfect detection severely underestimated the proportion of area occupied and slightly overestimated mean latitude. Static models indicated Louisiana Waterthrush distribution was most closely associated with moderate temperatures, while dynamic occupancy models indicated that initial occupancy was associated with diurnal temperature ranges and colonization of sites was associated with moderate precipitation. Overall, the proportion of area occupied and mean latitude changed little during the 1997-2013 study period. Near-term forecasts of species distribution generated by dynamic models were more similar to subsequently observed distributions than forecasts from static models. Occupancy models incorporating a finite mixture model on detection - a new extension to correlated detection occupancy models - were better supported and may reduce bias associated with detection heterogeneity. We argue that replacing phenomenological static models with more mechanistic dynamic models can improve projections of future species distributions.

Through stakeholder engagement and outreach across the Northeast region we formed an interdisciplinary working group that developed a regional synthesis of how the timing of biological and human activities were shifting in the Gulf of Maine.

Twenty studies demonstrated shifts in timing of regional marine organisms and seasonal environmental events. The most common response was earlier timing, observed in spring onset, spring and winter hydrology, zooplankton abundance, occurrence of several larval fishes, and diadromous fish migrations. Later timing was documented for fall onset, reproduction and fledging in Atlantic puffins, spring and fall phytoplankton blooms, and occurrence of additional larval fishes. Changes in event duration generally increased and were detected in zooplankton peak abundance, early life history periods of macro\u2010invertebrates, and lobster fishery landings. Reduced duration was observed in winter\u2013spring ice\u2010affected stream flows. Two studies projected phenological changes, both finding diapause duration would decrease in zooplankton under future climate scenarios.

We consider the 1815 eruption of the Indonesian volcano Tambora and its impact on Gulf of Maine (GoM) coastal and riparian fisheries in 1816. Applying complex adaptive systems theory with historical methods, we analyzed fish export data and contemporary climate records to disclose human and piscine responses to Tambora\u2019s extreme weather at different spatial and temporal scales while also considering sociopolitical influences. Results identified a tipping point in GoM fisheries induced by concatenating social and biological responses to extreme weather. Abnormal daily temperatures selectively affected targeted fish species\u2014alewives, shad, herring, and mackerel\u2014according to their migration and spawning phenologies and temperature tolerances. First to arrive, alewives suffered the worst. Crop failure and incipient famine intensified fishing pressure, especially in heavily settled regions where dams already compromised watersheds. Insufficient alewife runs led fishers to target mackerel, the next species appearing in abundance along the coast; thus, 1816 became the \u201cmackerel year.\u201d Critically, the shift from riparian to marine fisheries persisted and expanded after temperatures moderated and alewives recovered. We conclude that contingent human adaptations to extraordinary weather permanently altered this complex system.

With the coproduction of science in mind, our objectives were the following: (1) to document management priorities of floodplain conservation lands, and (2) identify science needs required to better manage the identified management priorities under nonstationary conditions, i.e., climate change, through stakeholder queries and interactions. We conducted an online survey with 80 resource managers of floodplain conservation lands along the Upper and Middle Mississippi River and Lower Missouri River, USA, to evaluate management priority, management intensity, and available scientific information for management objectives and conservation targets. Management objectives with the least information available relative to priority included controlling invasive species, maintaining respectful relationships with neighbors, and managing native, nongame species. Conservation targets with the least information available to manage relative to management priority included pollinators, marsh birds, reptiles, and shore birds. A follow-up workshop and survey focused on clarifying science needs to achieve management objectives under nonstationary conditions. Managers agreed that metrics of inundation, including depth and extent of inundation, and frequency, duration, and timing of inundation would be the most useful metrics for management of floodplain conservation lands with multiple objectives.

These lands have the potential to provide valuable ecosystem services like provision of habitat, nutrient processing, carbon sequestration, and flood-water storage that produce economic values in terms of recreational spending, improved water quality, and decreased flood hazards. However, floodplain managers may need tools to help them understand nonstationary conditions on conservation lands. This project worked with floodplain managers to identify the information most needed to understand nonstationary conditions, and to develop tools they can apply to conservation lands to improve decision making. Our survey revealed that time, funding, and a perceived disconnect between research and management limited the ability of managers to use new information. However, managers were willing to partner with scientists to identify science needs, relevant spatiotemporal scales, and products useful for management decisions. Floodplain managers agreed that metrics of inundation, including depth, extent, frequency, duration, and seasonality are the most useful metrics for management of floodplain conservation lands. We developed an approach to derive digital spatial layers of these metrics of inundation from numeric flood inundation models under baseline and climate change scenarios. We applied this method to the lower 500 miles of the Missouri River, making 45 spatial layers available to aid in current and future management decisions of conservation properties.

Many of these swamps are managed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) as critical deer wintering complexes (DWC), and there has been an effort to acquire and protect additional acres of DWC as deer habitat. Conifer swamps are also managed for many other values, including timber products, which are difficult or impossible to access during mild winters. Recent warming trends have resulted in a 71% decrease in ice cover on Lake Superior, and a concomitant increase in lake effect snow. As the severity of winters in terms of duration of snow depth has increased, DWC habitat has become more critical to deer over-winter survival. However, regional climate models project a shift from lake effect snow to lake effect rain as temperatures continue to rise. Thus, while DWCs have high wildlife habitat value now, their value to deer is expected to decrease by the end of the 21st century. The economic value of timber products is also expected to decrease as access for harvest becomes more challenging.

Despite the added benefits, there have been few applications of SCR\u2010RSF integration, potentially due to complexities of specifying and fitting such models.

Both models indicated increased second\u2010order selection (i.e., density) for areas close to mixed conifer forest, while the integrated SCR\u2010RSF model had a lower effect size due to modulation from spatial variability in space use.

Snow depth observations were correlated with SNODAS predictions for sites (R 2 = 0.20) and regions (R 2 = 0.16), yet we detected factors associated with SNODAS bias at both scales. Specifically, SNODAS underpredicted depths at high elevations, at sites with higher solar radiation, and within conifer\u2010dominated forest. Depths were most underpredicted at highest elevations, up to 44 and 26 cm on average at the site and region scales, respectively. Bias was greatest when predictions were lowest, occasionally predicting snow absence when depths were &gt;100 cm at camera sites. We also detected breakdowns in accuracy when certain environmental conditions varied within the 1 km2 SNODAS grid cells. For example, underprediction was greatest when the solar radiation values of camera stations increased relative to the mean of the SNODAS grid cells. This relationship was most prominent in mountainous regions, suggesting that factors which influence solar radiation (e.g. topographic complexity) contribute to SNODAS inaccuracy. We caution using gridded snow data for ecological studies when bias is unknown. We suggest increased sampling to adjust for errors associated with gridded data products that arise from factors, such as forest cover and topographic variability. Increasing resolution and accuracy of climate data will improve predictions of species\u2019 responses to climate change.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5ec6e1cf82ce476925eddc56", "parentId": "57b36192e4b03bcb01039675", "proj_id": "57b35c6de4b03bcb01039665", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5ec6e1cf82ce476925eddc56"}, "5a4677f2e4b0d05ee8c056e6": {"title": "Montane birds shift downslope despite recent warming in the northern Appalachian Mountains", "contacts": [{"name": "William V.

In the northern Appalachian Mountains of North America, not only is it becoming warmer at mid-elevations but the ecotone between the northern hardwood and the montane coniferous forests is also shifting. Therefore, species that are limited by climate or habitat along the elevational gradient of mountains may also be experiencing distributional shifts. We studied birds along replicate elevational gradients in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, USA, from 1993 to 2009 and used mixed effects models to estimate the rate of elevational change to test the hypothesis that northern hardwood forest- and montane forest-dependent birds are shifting upslope, consistent with climate change predictions. As predicted, the upper elevational boundary of 9 out of 16 low-elevation species showed evidence of shifting upslope an average of 99 m over the course of the study period. Contrary to our expectations, 9 out of 11 high-elevation species had lower elevational boundaries that shifted downslope an average of 19 m.

We tested 1) the efficacy of data loggers to record presence\u2013absence and index space use in a 6.75-km2 area, validating marten locations using radiotelemetry and camera traps; and 2) whether there were diel and seasonal biases of data logger detections.

Detection probability and spatial use were most influenced by elevation, distance to data loggers, and line-of-sight view.

This hypothesis, often credited to Charles Darwin, is a pattern widely assumed to occur in nature. However, abiotic factors can impose constraints on both limits and there is scant evidence to support the latter prediction. Deviations from these predictions may arise from correlations between abiotic factors and biotic interactions, as a lack of data to evaluate the hypothesis, or be an artifact of scale. Combining two tenets of ecology\u2014niche theory and predator\u2013prey theory\u2014provides an opportunity to understand how biotic interactions influence range limits and how this varies by trophic level. We propose an expansion of RLT, interactive RLT (iRLT), to understand the causes of range limits and predict range shifts. Incorporating the main predictions of Darwin's hypothesis, iRLT hypothesizes that abiotic and biotic factors can interact to impact both limits of a species\u2019 range. We summarize current thinking on range limits and perform an integrative review to evaluate support for iRLT and trophic differences along range margins, surveying the mammal community along the boreal\u2010temperate and forest\u2010tundra ecotones of North America. Our review suggests that range\u2010limit dynamics are more nuanced and interactive than classically predicted by RLT. Many (57 of 70) studies indicate that biotic factors can ameliorate harsh climatic conditions along high\u2010latitude/altitude limits. Conversely, abiotic factors can also mediate biotic interactions along low\u2010latitude/altitude limits (44 of 68 studies). Both scenarios facilitate range expansion, contraction or stability depending on the strength and the direction of the abiotic or biotic factors. As predicted, biotic interactions most often occurred along lower limits, yet there were trophic differences. Carnivores were only limited by competitive interactions (n  = 25), whereas herbivores were more influenced by predation and parasitism (77%; 55 of 71 studies). We highlight how these differences may create divergent range patterns along lower limits.

We developed an urban growth model (SPRAWL), evaluated it with hindcasting, and used it to simulate urban growth across the northeastern United States between 2010 and 2080 under four alternative scenarios. In the model, urban growth is constrained by demand for new development for each time step at the subregional scale. Demand is subsequently allocated to local application panes (5 km on a side within 15\u202fkm window) using a unique landscape context matching algorithm, such that the more historical development that occurred in the matched training windows the higher the proportion of future demand assigned to the pane. Lastly, demand in each pane is allocated among development types and then allocated to individual patches based on suitability surfaces unique to that landscape context. SPRAWL has a multi-level, multi-scale structure that captures urban growth drivers operating at multiple scales and, when combined with the unique matching and suitability algorithms, induces non-stationarity in urban growth across time and space.

Food web studies are also needed to evaluate trophic linkages and to assess the consequences of inconsistent zooplankton prey and predator fields on energy flow within the NWA ecosystem.

The Gulf of Maine (GOM) Seasonal Migrants Project is an ongoing effort to determine the phenological changes occurring in the GOM across marine mammals, sea turtles, and other marine species of conservation concern. As part of that study, stranding data of injured or dead animals was explored for its utility to serve as supplemental data to amend more traditional survey data where observations are scarce. NOAA\u2019s Greater Atlantic Region Marine Mammal Stranding Network Database was examined for its utility as a potential long-term time series for the evaluation of phenological patterns and shifts. Although records from stranding events represent sick or injured animals, these data have been found to be reasonably comparable to survey data and provide useful information on species\u2019 distribution, abundance, and foraging ecology. In this study, we focused on stranding data of two marine mammal species, harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and gray seals (Halichoerus grypus). It was anticipated these data would also be good indicators of the areas and habitats that seal populations use on a seasonal and annual basis in the region. Viable stranding data from Maine to North Carolina included 1,571 gray seals and 4,399 harbor seals from 2001 to 2015.

Yet, fishery landings from these systems are frequently unresponsive to changes in the severity and extent of hypoxia, and population-scale effects have been difficult to measure except in extreme hypoxic conditions with hypoxia-sensitive species. We investigated fine-scale temporal and spatial variability in dissolved oxygen in Lake Erie as it related to fish distribution and catch efficiencies of both active (bottom trawls) and passive (trap nets) fishing gears. Temperature and dissolved oxygen loggers placed near the edge of the hypolimnion exhibited much higher than expected variability. Hypoxic episodes of variable durations were frequently punctuated by periods of normoxia, consistent with high-frequency internal waves. High-resolution interpolations of water quality and hydroacoustic surveys suggest that fish habitat is compressed during hypoxic episodes, resulting in higher fish densities near the edges of hypoxia. At fixed locations with passive commercial fishing gear, catches with the highest values occurred when bottom waters were hypoxic for intermediate proportions of time. Proximity to hypoxia explained significant variation in bottom trawl catches, with higher catch rates near the edge of hypoxia. These results emphasize how hypoxia may elevate catch rates in various types of fishing gears, leading to a lack of association between indices of hypoxia and fishery landings. Increased catch rates of fish at the edges of hypoxia have important implications for stock assessment models that assume catchability is spatially homogeneous.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/552c1babe4b0b22a157f4f8d", "parentId": "50538b53e4b097cd4fce2f63", "proj_id": "500708cee4b0abf7ce733ff1", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=552c1babe4b0b22a157f4f8d"}, "58b6de42e4b01ccd54ff80d6": {"title": "Using Variance Structure to Quantify Responses to Perturbation in Fish Catches", "contacts": [{"name": "Tiffany E.

Here, we found that average catch and total variability of catches decreased following perturbation, but all sampling locations did not respond in a consistent manner.

The modeling approach described herein is flexible and would be transferable to other systems or metrics.

For example, time series of catch-per-effort data are often examined for the presence of long-term trends. However, it is also of interest to know whether certain sampled locations are exhibiting temporal patterns that deviate from the overall pattern exhibited across all sampled locations. Patterns at these \u201cunusual\u201d sites may be the result of site-specific abiotic (e.g., habitat) or biotic (e.g., the presence of an invasive species) factors that cause these sites to respond differently to natural or anthropogenic drivers of population dynamics or to management actions. We present a Bayesian model selection approach that allows for detection of unique sites\u2014locations that display temporal patterns with documentable inconsistencies relative to the overall global average temporal pattern. We applied this modeling approach to long-term gill-net data collected from a fixed-site, standardized sampling program for Yellow Perch Perca flavescens in Oneida Lake, New York, but the approach is also relevant to shorter time series data. We used this approach to identify six sites with distinct temporal patterns that differed from the lakewide trend, and we describe the magnitude of the difference between these patterns and the lakewide average trend.

The Laurentian Great Lakes in North America are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world, and they have experienced major changes due to fluctuations in pollution and nutrient loadings, exploitation of natural resources, introductions of non\u2010native species, and shifting climatic patterns. In this project, we analyzed established long\u2010term data about important fish populations from across the Great Lakes basin, including from Oneida Lake in NY, Lake Michigan, and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Our objective was to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in fish catches from large freshwater lakes that have experienced large\u2010scale changing conditions. We evaluated analytical approaches with the potential to disentangle sources of variability in standardized monitoring data. Specifically, we considered 1) how the decomposition of spatial and temporal variation in fish catches can be used to measure a response to perturbation; 2) how truncation of population age structure can alter population oscillations which may shift how a population is affected by environmental fluctuations; and 3) how the composition of a fish community may respond to a suite of environmental drivers through time.

In this study, three stream temperature models were implemented for two different case-study basins in the Northeast Climate Science Center region. Two coupled hydrology-stream temperature (physical) models were used: VIC-RBM and SWAT-Ficklin et al. (2012). The third model implemented was a nonlinear regression (statistical) model developed by Mohseni et al. (1998). Metrics were developed to assess these models regarding their prediction skill, data input requirements, spatial and temporal resolutions, and \u201cuser-friendliness.\u201d This comprehensive assessment will be employed by aquatic resource managers in need of projected stream temperatures for management decisions in the face of climate change. Additionally, these models were used to predict stream temperatures under a range of future air temperature and precipitation scenarios for the study basins.

This research applies a statistical stream temperature model (Mohseni et al, 1998) to 905 sites across the northeastern United States to determine if such models can be useful to resource managers. Statistical analysis on the calibrated model parameters across the best-fit sites is used to provide information on watershed characteristics which may be critical to stream temperature. In addition to air temperature, which is the obvious driver of stream temperature, groundwater influence, forest coverage, urban area, and drainage area, which is representative of travel time, are the most significant watershed characteristics that impact stream temperature.

A predictive model of stream temperature is also developed, extending the work of Mohseni et al. (1998). This model uses watershed characteristics and meteorological data to generate stream temperatures at an ungaged location. Uses of this model include analyzing the impacts of anthropogenic changes on stream temperature regimes and the generation of realistic stream temperatures at a location for use in another model, such as the physical stream temperature model developed by Yearsley (2011).

However, forest influences on snow accumulation and ablation vary with climate, topography, and land cover and are therefore subject to substantial temporal and spatial variability. We utilize multiple years of snow observations from across the region to assess forest-snow interactions in the relatively warm winter conditions characteristic of the maritime and maritime-continental climates. We (1) quantify the difference in snow magnitude and disappearance timing between forests and open areas and (2) assess how forest modifications of snow accumulation and ablation processes combine to determine whether snow is retained longer in the forest or in the open. We find that snow disappearance timing generally ranges from synchronous in the forest and open, to snow persisting up to 13\u2009weeks longer in the open relative to a forested area. However, in locations subject to high wind speeds, differential snow disappearance timing is reversed: snow persists 2-5 weeks longer in the forest. Analysis of snow accumulation and loss through the winter and spring indicate that forest canopy-modulated snow deposition, rather than ablation processes, sets up the difference in snow duration between forests and open. The difference in snow accumulation between open areas and forests is larger than the difference in snow ablation, except at windy sites. Subsequently, differential snow disappearance timing tends toward longer snow retention in the open.

These 40 \u00d7 40 m forest plots, situated on the western slope of the Cascade Range, include unthinned second-growth coniferous forests, variable density thinned forests, forest gaps in which a 20 m diameter (approximately equivalent to one tree height) gap was cut in the middle of each plot, and old-growth forest. Together, this publicly available data set includes snow depth and density observations from manual snow surveys, distributed snow duration observations from ground temperature sensors and time-lapse cameras, meteorological data collected at two open locations and three forested locations, and forest canopy data from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and hemispherical photographs.

In contrast, direct collaboration with an outdoor science school that was already sending students to make weekly snow observations proved fruitful in both data collection and educational outreach.

Understanding the impacts of changing fire regimes on forest recruitment and succession, species distributions, carbon cycling, and ecosystem services is critical, but challenging across broad spatial scales. One important and understudied aspect of fire regimes is the unburned area within fire perimeters; these areas can function as fire refugia across the landscape during and after wildfire by providing habitat and seed sources. With increasing fire activity, there is speculation that fire intensity and combustion completeness are also increasing, which we hypothesized would yield smaller unburned proportions and changes in fire refugia patterns. We sought to determine (1) whether the unburned proportion of wildfires decreased across the northwestern United States from 1984 to 2014 and (2) whether patterns of unburned patches were signifi- cantly different across ecoregions, land cover type, and land ownership. We utilized a Landsat-derived geospatial database of unburned islands within 2298 fires across the inland northwestern USA (including eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, and Idaho) from 1984 to 2014. We evaluated patterns of the total unburned proportion and spatial patterns of unburned patches of the fires across different ecoregions, land cover types, and land ownership. We found that unburned area proportion exhibited no change over the three decades, suggesting that recent trends in area burned and overall severity have not affected fire refugia, important to post-fire ecosystem recovery. There were ecoregional differences in mean unburned proportion, patch area, and patch density, suggesting influences of vegetation and topography on the formation of unburned area.

These patches of persistence also may yield insights into approaches for developing fire-resilient landscapes by forest managers and communities seeking to reduce wildfire hazard. Here, we present results showing no decline in proportion of persistent patches in three study areas surrounding National Parks in the western United States, even as research and anecdotal information suggests that fires have become larger and more severe. We also show climate linkages to metrics of persistence that echo previous findings in climate-fire research, and we introduce a framework for addressing global change impacts on forest pattern more broadly. Specifically, we discuss the interactions of multiple drivers at landscape scales and the need to disaggregate relative influences using mixed methods that can address both social and ecological phenomenon.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/56abaf90e4b0403299f46338", "parentId": "53189314e4b051b1b924e9e5", "proj_id": "5313a19be4b0123ceff00944", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=56abaf90e4b0403299f46338"}, "5956702fe4b0d1f9f050d80a": {"title": "Tree mortality from fires, bark beetles, and timber harvest during a hot and dry decade in the western United States (2003\u20132012)", "contacts": [{"name": "IOP Publishing", "type": "Publisher", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Logan T Berner", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Beverly E Law", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Arjan J H Meddens", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Jeffrey A Hicke", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Northwest CASC", "fy": "2014", "summary": "Abstract (from http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6f94/meta): High temperatures and severe drought contributed to extensive tree mortality from fires and bark beetles during the 2000s in parts of the western continental United States.

We quantified mean annual tree mortality from fires, bark beetles, and timber harvest from 2003\u20132012 for each state in this region. We estimated tree mortality from fires and beetles using tree aboveground carbon (AGC) stock and disturbance data sets derived largely from remote sensing.

While these agents of forest change frequently overlap, uncertainty remains regarding their interactions and influence on specific subsequent fire effects such as change in canopy cover. Acquisition of pre- and post-fire Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data on the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon provided an opportunity to isolate and quantify fire effects coincident with specific agents of change. This study characterizes the influence of pre-fire mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) and timber harvest disturbances on LiDAR-estimated change in canopy cover. Observed canopy loss from fire was greater (higher severity) in areas experiencing pre-fire MPB (\u0394 18.8%CC) than fire-only (\u0394 11.1%CC). Additionally, increasing MPB intensity was directly related to greater canopy loss. Canopy loss was lower for all areas of pre-fire timber harvest (\u0394 3.9%CC) than for fire-only, but among harvested areas, the greatest change was observed in the oldest treatments and the most intensive treatments [i.e., stand clearcut (\u0394 5.0%CC) and combination of shelterwood establishment cuts and shelterwood removal cuts (\u0394 7.7%CC)].

A fire impact that has not been widely addressed is the development of unburned islands; areas within the fire perimeter that do not burn. These areas function as critical ecological refugia for biota during or following wildfires, but they have been largely ignored in methodological studies of remote sensing assessing fire severity under the assumption that they will be detected by algorithms for delineating fire perimeters. Our objective was to develop a model for classifying unburned areas within wildfire perimeters using moderate resolution satellite (i.e., Landsat) and ancillary data. We performed field observations at locations that were unburned or lightly burned within the perimeters of 12 wildfires that burned in 2012 and 2014, and augmented this with field data previously acquired on another seven wildfires across the study region. We used randomForest and classification trees to separate burned from unburned locations with high overall classification accuracy (91.7% and 89.2%, for randomForest and classification tree methods respectively). Classification accuracy was significantly higher than the semi-automated classification products from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program. After application of the most parsimonious and accurate classification tree model, we found that the average unburned proportion of the fires was 20% with high variability between fires (standard deviation: 16.4%). The total area of unburned islands in non-forested areas was significantly higher than the total unburned area in forested areas.

How can we use that information to manage forests and rangelands in a way that supports continued development of unburned islands and fire refugia, even under climate change? To answer these questions, we developed a historical atlas of unburned islands across the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, and Idaho) and analyzed trends.  We found that unburned islands conservatively comprise 10% of all area within wildfire perimeters in the Northwest, and that this proportion has not increased or decreased over the last three decades. We examined several case study fires where repeat fires occurred and found that most unburned islands are ephemeral; that is, they don\u2019t remain unburned through multiple fires. The exception was particularly wet sites such as boggy meadows or riparian areas, or unburnable materials such as rocks or bare soils. Further, we found that the proportion of the fire that was unburned and the size and density of unburned islands was not related to fire size. This means that as fires become larger with climate change, there will still likely be a relatively consistent proportion that does not burn, to serve as a refuge for species. Finally, climate was a poor predictor of unburned proportion. This is quite meaningful because it suggests that what determines the formation of unburned islands is localized conditions: topography, fuels, and fire suppression tactics.

We compared large wildfires in Pacific Northwest forests from 1984 to 2015 to modeled historic fire regimes. Despite late twentieth\u2010century increases in area burned, we show that Pacific Northwest forests have experienced an order of magnitude less fire over 32 yr than expected under historic fire regimes.

While these methods are important, field data is usually limited to opportunistic post-fire observations, and spectral data often lacks validation with specific variables of change. Additional uncertainty remains regarding how best to account for environmental variables influencing fire effects (e.g., weather) for which observational data cannot easily be acquired, and whether pre-fire agents of change such as bark beetle and timber harvest impact model accuracy.

Spatial regression modeling was assessed as a methodology to account for spatial autocorrelation, and model consistency was quantified across areas impacted by pre-fire mountain pine beetle and timber harvest.

To examine the causes and consequences of small fire refugia, we field-mapped all unburned patches \u22651\u202fm2 within a contiguous 25.6\u202fha forest plot that burned at generally low-to-moderate severity in the 2013 Yosemite Rim Fire, California, USA. Within the Yosemite Forest Dynamics Plot (YFDP), there were 685 unburned patches \u22651\u202fm2, covering a total unburned area of 12,597\u202fm2 (4.9%). Small refugia occurred in all fire severity classifications. Random forest models showed that the proportion of unburned area of 100\u202fm2 grid cells corresponded to pre-fire density and basal area of trees, distance to the nearest stream, and immediate fire mortality, but the relationships were complex and model accuracy was variable.

Increased sedimentation due to soil erosion in burned watersheds can negatively impact downstream aquatic ecosystems and the quality and supply of water. At least 65% of the water supply in the western USA originates in watersheds covered by trees, shrubs, and/or grasses that are prone to wildfire16. Understanding how changing fire frequency, extent, and location will affect watersheds, reservoirs, and the ecosystem services they supply to communities is therefore of great societal importance.  A primary threat to socio-ecological systems in this region from wildland fire, and subsequent post-fire sedimentation, is the decline or disruption of watershed-based ecosystem services, such as the maintenance of water quality and the quantity of water supplied. Projections also suggest a dramatic human population increase in Western states that will likely stress water resources with increased demand. However, the effect of expected post-fire sedimentation, any changes to water supply, and potential increases in water demand are all functions of unknown future climate and land use conditions. To estimate the magnitude of these potential effects, we modeled expected post-fire sedimentation across the West at the subbasin level through the year 2050, using an ensemble of climate, fire, and sedimentation models. We show post-fire sedimentation may increase by 10% for \u00be of the watersheds modeled, while \u00bc of watersheds are projected to increase by 100% or more. Looking at the range of population projections, the 2010 population of the eleven western states (70.7M) is expected to increase by 28-47% by 2050. Much of this population growth will occur in the Southwest around existing metropolitan areas where water resources are already strained. Northern areas, however, are more variable in their growth and change in water use, as some communities grow by displacing more water intensive agriculture, leading to a decline in demand. Through merging both datasets, we explored watershed vulnerability to demonstrate where the effects of increased post-fire sedimentation and changing demand may lead to emergent areas of watershed-based ecosystem service disruption. Such areas deserve careful evaluation to determine if existing forest and watershed management plans are sufficient given the expected climate and population changes.

Techniques were incorporated to accommodate a large number of classes and to predict the future occurrence of climates beyond the contemporary climatic range of the biomes. Errors of prediction from the statistical model averaged 3.7%, but for individual biomes, ranged from 0% to 21.5%. In validating the ability of the model to identify climates without analogs, 78% of 1528 locations outside North America and 81% of land area of the Caribbean Islands were predicted to have no analogs among the 46 biomes. Biome climates were projected into the future according to low and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios of three General Circulation Models  (cgcm, hadley, and consensus) for three periods, the decades surrounding 2030, 2060, and 2090. Prominent in the projections were (1) expansion of climates suitable for the tropical dry deciduous forests of Mexico, (2) expansion of climates typifying desertscrub biomes of western USA and northern Mexico, (3) stability of climates typifying the evergreen\u2013deciduous forests of eastern USA, and (4) northward expansion of climates suited to temperate forests, Great Plains grasslands, and montane forests to the detriment of taiga and tundra climates. Maps indicating either poor agreement among projections or climates without contemporary analogs identify geographic areas where land management programs would be most equivocal. Concentrating efforts and resources where projections are more certain can assure land managers a greater likelihood of success.  Because General Circulation Models (GCM) are key to understanding future climates, the tool we envision must take into account the variability in GCM output resulting from different model formulations and emissions scenarios. However, to land managers, variation represents uncertainty, and uncertainty often leads to inaction. Our approach was to emphasize similarities in responses projected from the disparate formulations rather than dwell on the differences. The tool must also contain provisions for identifying future climates with no contemporary analog because new climates may best be suited for species assemblages that do not exist today. To be useful, the scope of a vegetation model should be neither too broad to constrain local interpretation nor so parochial as to limit management options. It is mandatory, moreover, that this tool incorporates powerful statistical techniques that retain the robustness and flexibility necessary for anticipating and accommodating actual changes.  Our analysis uses the biotic communities of Brown (1994), mapped and digitized by Brown et al. (1998). This classification system meshes well with our goals: It is based on distributions of flora and fauna without reliance on physiography, the coverage includes all of North America, and altitudinal zonation of vegetation is an integral part of the system. For simplicity, we use the term \"biome\" to reference the biotic communities. Previous analyses used this classification system for modeling climatic control of biome distributions in western USA. These analyses produced errors of fit (~10%) that largely resulted from an imperfect alignment between digitized polygons in the classification system and the digital elevation model used to generate point estimates of biome climates. Misalignment had greatest impact at borders of polygons, along shore lines, and on mountain peaks, and therefore, was of greatest source of error with small, irregularly shaped polygons and for biomes occurring in altitudinal sequence. In this analysis, we considered biomes from throughout North America and used supplemental information to alleviate adverse effects of the misaligned data files.  We built on the statistical modeling of Rehfeldt et al. (2006) to predict contemporary realized climatic niches of North American biomes. Ecological niche models have received considerable criticism mostly because of their inability to represent migration or colonization potentials, competitive interactions, and effects of enhanced CO2 on water-use efficiency. The first of these is not an issue. Niche modelers themselves make no claims of projecting species distributions, but instead emphasize that their models project suitable climates. Likewise, competitive interactions that limit species distributions can be defined climatically and are invalidated only when future climates have no contemporary analog. By predicting and projecting the occurrence of novel climates, statistical models can negate this second point of contention. However, it is true that correlative models are not yet capable of accounting for physiological impacts of enhanced CO2 on gas exchange and productivity. Such effects, however, are well characterized in only a few species, and impacts on species distributions are unknown. More research is required before effects of enhanced CO2 can be incorporated with credibility into vegetation models, whether correlative or mechanistic.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57475995e4b07e28b663d8dd", "parentId": "5318c6bfe4b0ae6e9d5a3bb3", "proj_id": "5318ba1ae4b0ae6e9d5a3b7c", "purpose": "Land managers require decision-support tools suitable for dealing with oncoming climate-mediated ecosystem changes.

In this species, the supercooling point (SCP) is representative of mortality induced by acute cold exposure. Mountain pine beetle SCP and associated cold-induced mortality fluctuate throughout a generation, with the highest SCPs prior to and following winter. Using observed SCPs of field-collected D. ponderosae larvae throughout the developmental season and associated phloem temperatures, we developed a mechanistic model that describes the SCP distribution of a population as a function of daily changes in the temperature-dependent processes leading to gain and loss of cold tolerance. It is based on the changing proportion of individuals in three states: (1) a non cold-hardened, feeding state, (2) an intermediate state in which insects have ceased feeding, voided their gut content and eliminated as many ice-nucleating agents as possible from the body, and (3) a fully cold-hardened state where insects have accumulated a maximum concentration of cryoprotectants (e.g. glycerol). Shifts in the proportion of individuals in each state occur in response to the driving variables influencing the opposite rates of gain and loss of cold hardening. The level of cold-induced mortality predicted by the model and its relation to extreme winter temperature is in good agreement with a range of field and laboratory observations. Our model predicts that cold tolerance of D. ponderosae varies within a season, among seasons, and among geographic locations depending on local climate. This variability is an emergent property of the model, and has important implications for understanding the insect's response to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, as well as population response to climate change. Because cold-induced mortality is but one of several major influences of climate on D. ponderosae population dynamics, we suggest that this model be integrated with others simulating the insect's biology.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57474116e4b07e28b663d884", "parentId": "5318c6bfe4b0ae6e9d5a3bb3", "proj_id": "5318ba1ae4b0ae6e9d5a3b7c", "purpose": "Our objective was to develop a process-based model of its cold tolerance that follows the general physiological principles of cold hardiness", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57474116e4b07e28b663d884"}, "574742b2e4b07e28b663d88a": {"title": "Projected current and future distributions for Big Sagebrush and Whitebark Pine tree species the Pacific Northwest", "contacts": [{"name": "Michael J.

Many recent changes in tree mortality, tree species distributions, and tree growth rates have been linked to changes in climate. Given that future climatic changes will likely surpass those experienced in the recent past, trees will likely face additional challenges as temperatures continue to rise and precipitation regimes shift. Managing forests in the face of climate change will require a basic understanding of which tree species will be most vulnerable to climate change and in what ways they will be vulnerable. We assessed the relative vulnerability to climate change of 11 tree species in western North America using a multivariate approach to quantify elements of sensitivity to climate change, exposure to climate change, and the capacity to adapt to climate change. Our assessment was based on a combination of expert knowledge, published studies, and projected changes in climate. The 11 species exhibited a range of vulnerabilities. Garry oak (Quercus garryana) was determined to be the most vulnerable, largely due to its relatively high sensitivity. Garry oak occupies some of the driest low woodland and savanna sites from British Columbia to California and is highly dependent on disturbances, such as periodic, low intensity fire. These low intensity and high frequency fires suppress competition and intrusion of Garry oak woodlands by conifers. Garry oak is also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and generally only dominates dry sites. Big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) was determined to be the least vulnerable of the 11 species, largely due to its adaptive capacity. Big leaf maple can reproduce quickly after disturbances and its seeds can disperse long distances potentially allowing it to move in response to a changing climate. Our analyses provide a framework for assessing vulnerability and for determining why some species will likely be more vulnerable than others. Such information will be critical as natural resource managers and conservation practitioners strive to address the impacts of climate change with limited funds.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/574742b2e4b07e28b663d88a", "parentId": "5318c6bfe4b0ae6e9d5a3bb3", "proj_id": "5318ba1ae4b0ae6e9d5a3b7c", "purpose": "In support of the Pacific Northwest Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (www.climatevulnerability.org) we developed a series of tree species projections for use in regional planning.

This necessitated creating maps that displayed only values from zero (the optimum modeled route) to a species-specific linkage width cutoff to identify areas that contribute most to connectivity between each HCA pair. Because of the smaller extent of this analysis and the finer-scale data that were available, we chose cutoff values (Table 2.2, WHCWG 2012) that produced linkage zone widths that were somewhat narrower than those mapped at the statewide scale, while being mindful of the intent that linkage zones serve not only focal species, but other species and processes as well. Keeping linkage zones reasonably wide also acknowledges that there is still considerable uncertainty in GIS base data, resistance models, and other parameters used in our modeling process.

Bioclimatic models were built using the Random Forest algorithm. Projected changes in vegetation were also modeled using the Random Forest algorithm but were produced by Rehfeldt et al. (2012). Projected current distribution is based on the average climate conditions for the years 1961-1990. Projected future distributions are based on average climate conditions for the years 2070-2099 using downscaled (30-second or ~1-kilometer resolution) climate projections from two Global Circulation Models: CGCM3.1 (T47) and UKMO-HadCM3. Both projections use the A2 emissions scenario and are from the CMIP3 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report) family of climate simulations. Due to changing climatic conditions, species ranges are expected to shift throughout the course of this century. Modeling subsequent shifts in suitable habitat for animal species, and the resulting changes in species assemblages, represent critical information for resource planners and managers. Developing robust suitability models for large geographic areas can be challenging, in part due to insufficient sampling data and to computational limits associated with modeling large geographies at a fine-grained spatial resolution. To overcome these challenges, I developed a method to model habitat suitability in which I built correlative climate suitability models for 366 terrestrial animal species at a relatively coarse spatial resolution for the entire North American continent using species range maps and 23 bioclimatic variables. I then applied the models to both current and projected future climate data downscaled to a moderately fine resolution for western North America. I refined the resulting climate suitability projections by applying a filter that limited suitability to areas in which suitable biomes were projected to be present. I verified my modeling results using an independent species occurrence data set, finding a median accuracy rate of 70%. I found that incorporating information about biomes into the models resulted in projections of larger climate-driven changes in suitability\u2014on average a difference of about 10%. My results also indicate that study species are more likely to see climate-driven losses than gains in habitat suitability. The percentage of study species projected to undergo a significant net decrease in habitat suitability was double the percentage projected to experience a net increase. These results highlight the shortcomings of many broad-scale models and highlight the need to take finer scale vegetation patterns into account. They also indicate that while many animal species could potentially benefit from climate-change induced increases in habitat suitability, the majority of species may suffer from substantial decreases, complicating future conservation efforts.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57473c09e4b07e28b663d870", "parentId": "5318c6bfe4b0ae6e9d5a3bb3", "proj_id": "5318ba1ae4b0ae6e9d5a3b7c", "purpose": "Here, I combine species distribution models based on climate variables with simple biome-level habitat associations to produce models that can project future impacts on species distributions based on projected changes in climate and vegetation, with a reasonable level of accuracy.

We used LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, to assess potential future vegetation changes for a large topographically complex area of the northwest United States and southwest Canada (38.0\u201358.0\u00b0N latitude by 136.6\u2013103.0\u00b0W longitude). LPJ is a process-based vegetation model that mechanistically simulates the effect of changing climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetation.

In this study, we used LPJ at a 30-second (~1-km) spatial resolution to simulate potential vegetation changes for 2070\u20132099.

The presence of snow, rain, or mixed-phase precipitation affects the initial and boundary conditions that drive hydrological models. Despite their foundational importance to terrestrial hydrology, typical phase partitioning methods (PPMs) specify the phase based on near-surface air temperature only. Our review conveys the diversity of tools available for PPMs in hydrological modeling and the advancements needed to improve predictions in complex terrain with large spatiotemporal variations in precipitation phase. Initially, we review the processes and physics that control precipitation phase as relevant to hydrologists, focusing on the importance of processes occurring aloft. There is a wide range of options for field observations of precipitation phase, but there is a lack of a robust observation networks in complex terrain. New remote sensing observations have the potential to increase PPM fidelity, but generally require assumptions typical of other PPMs and field validation before they are operational. We review common PPMs and find that accuracy is generally increased at finer measurement intervals and by including humidity information. One important tool for PPM development is atmospheric modeling, which includes microphysical schemes that have not been effectively linked to hydrological models or validated against near-surface precipitation-phase observations. The review concludes by describing key research gaps and recommendations to improve PPMs, including better incorporation of atmospheric information, improved validation datasets, and regional-scale gridded data products. Two key points emerge from this synthesis for the hydrologic community: (1) current PPMs are too simple to capture important processes and are not well validated for most locations, (2) lack of sophisticated PPMs increases the uncertainty in estimation of hydrological sensitivity to changes in precipitation phase at local to regional scales.

These changes are particularly important when considering the stability of a keystone species such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), which contributes critical ecosystem services across its broad North American range. As a relatively drought intolerant species, projected changes of altered precipitation timing, amount, and type (e.g. snow or rain) may influence aspen response to fire, especially in moisture-limited and winter precipitation-dominated portions of its range. Aspen is generally considered an early-seral species that benefits from fire, but increases in fire activity across much of the western United States could affect the species in unpredictable ways. This study examined post-fire aspen stands across a regional climate gradient spanning from the north-central Great Basin to the northeastern portion of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (USA). We investigated the influence of seasonal precipitation and temperature variables, snowpack, and site conditions (e.g. browsing levels, topography) on density of post-fire aspen regeneration (i.e. all small trees ha\u22121) and recruitment (i.e. small trees \u22652\u202fm\u202ftall\u202fha\u22121) across 15 fires that occurred between 2000 and 2009. The range of post-fire regeneration (2500\u201371,600 small\u202ftrees\u202fha\u22121) and recruitment (0\u201332,500 small trees \u22652\u202fm\u202fha\u22121) densities varied widely across plots. Linear mixed effects models demonstrated that both response variables increased primarily with early winter (Oct-Dec) precipitation during the \u2018fire-regen period\u2019 (i.e., fire year and five years after fire) relative to the 30-year mean. The 30-year mean of early winter precipitation and fire-regen period snowpack were also positively related to recruitment densities. Both response variables decreased with higher shrub cover, highlighting the importance of considering shrub competition in post-fire environments. Regeneration and recruitment densities were negatively related to proportion browsed aspen leaders and animal pellet densities (no./m2), respectively, indicating the influence of ungulate browsing even at the relatively low levels observed across sites. A post-hoc exploratory analysis suggests that deviation in early winter precipitation during the fire-regen period (relative to 30-year means) varied among sites along directional gradients, emphasizing the need to consider multiple spatiotemporal scales when investigating climate effects on post-fire successional dynamics.

Aspen ecosystems are in decline across portions of the western U.S., which is thought to be partly due to drought, and recent research suggests that future climate projected for the western U.S. will be even less capable of supporting aspen.  We used different research methods to investigate key controls on aspen growth and survivability in the northern Great Basin and central Rockies. Specifically, we projected the potential effects of increasing temperature, altered moisture availability, and fire occurrence on aspen under climate change. Some of our results focused on the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in southwestern Idaho, and suggest that aspen productivity could decline in the future, especially at lower elevations, and particularly if more greenhouse gases are emitted. However, our results also suggest that aspen have some capacity to shift their timing of growth in response to climate, and may remain productive in the future in certain locations with specific temperature and precipitation conditions. Our results also suggest that, although aspen are regenerating in the region following fire, future climate could influence regeneration success. Results from our models also suggest that watershed-scale runoff is projected to decline due to climate warming, increases in the annual amount rainfall versus snowfall, and increase in evaporative demand.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate recent modifications and further refinements to a multi-layer plant canopy model for simulating temperature and water vapor within three diverse forest canopies: a 4.5-m tall aspen thicket, a 15-m tall aspen canopy, and a 60-m tall Douglas fir canopy. Performance of the model was strongly related to source strength and profile stability within the canopy. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) between simulated and observed values tended to be higher for the summer periods when there was much more heat and vapor added to the canopy space due to solar warming and transpiration. Conversely, RMSD for vapor pressure was lowest for the winter periods when vapor additions within the canopy space were minimal. RMSD for temperature ranged from 0.1 &deg;C for the top of the 15-m aspen canopy during the winter to 1.6 &deg;C for the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen thicket during the summer period. RMSD for vapor pressure ranged from 0.002 kPa for the top of the 15-m aspen canopy during winter to 0.141 kPa for the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen thicket during the summer. Unstable profile conditions were simulated better by the model than stable conditions for all sites. RMSD for temperature at the bottom of the 4.5-m aspen, 15-m aspen and 60-m Douglas fir were 0.89, 0.77, and 0.85 &deg;C, respectively, for unstable conditions compared to 1.44, 0.89 and 1.16 &deg;C for stable conditions. Stable profiles are more challenging to accurately simulate because dispersion within a stable profile is lower thereby creating larger gradients. Temperature differences between the bottom and above canopy sensors were within 3 &deg;C for unstable conditions for all sites, but were as much as \u221210 &deg;C under stable conditions. The model exhibited the greatest discrepancies relative to measurements in the 4.5-m aspen thicket under stable conditions, likely due to horizontal ejections from this relatively small patch of vegetation that could not be addressed by the one-dimensional model.

Climate scenarios were constructed in the script, \u201cclimate_analyze.R.\u201d Climate scenarios input to this script were obtained from the Integrated Scenarios project: http://climate.nkn.uidaho.edu/IntegratedScenarios/. Historic (1950-2005) and future (2050-2099, RCP 8.5) climate projections were obtained for the grid cell containing Upper Sheep Creek. Seasonally variable daily mean changes in temperature and precipitation were derived by comparing historical and future data; these were stored as \u201cdelta functions\u201d (in delta.csv). For each seasonally variable scenario, the effective mean annual change in precipitation or temperature was calculated, and this was applied in the same amount for each day of the water year. The naming convention is as follows: txpydz, where \u201cx\u201d is the temperature deviation from the delta function identified by comparing historical data with 2050-2099 RCP8.5. \u201cy\u201d is the precipitation deviation from the original delta function. X or y values equal to NA indicate that the precipitation or temperature was not changed. \u201cz\u201d indicates whether the simulation is seasonally constant (z = 1) or variable (z = 0). An empirically-derived drift function was applied to each of these scenarios in order to determine effective precipitation after snow drifting (Chauvin et al 2011). (3) model_runs: This directory contains all the files necessary to run the SHAW model. For more information on the SHAW model inputs and outputs, see ShawUsers.30.docx, or ftp site: ftp://ftp.nwrc.ars.usda.gov/public/ShawModel/. In these scenarios, the .exe files named for each HRU contain the names of the .inp files. Providing these .exe files as an input to SHAW allows for SHAW to be run automatically from an R script. The script, \u201crun_shaw_windows.R\u201d contains the code needed to run SHAW. To use this code, we recommend reading the script and changing the directory paths at the beginning of it to suit your needs. This script takes several hours to run on a laptop computer, particularly for the aspen HRU (~10 minutes per scenario on MacbookPro 2015 with 2.7GHz Intel Core i5 and 8GB RAM running Windows in Parallels). (4) model_output: These folders contain the outputs of the SHAW model after runs with the scenarios as described above. Within each HRU directory, each folder is named for one scenario, and contains the output files corresponding to that scenario. The output files are named only after the type of file (e.g., water.out). For that reason, the directory structure provided here is critical to the interpretability of these data. This folder also contains a hydrologic response unit not included in \u201csynthetic_data.\u201d In the \u201cas\u201d folder, aspen HRU site characteristics, including weather, have been used, but aspen have been replaced with grasses to simulate the effects of aspen mortality. (5) Tabular_results: This folder contains .csv files that summarize the data contained in the model_output folder over different time periods and for different analysis objectives. Each of these .csv files is created within the workflow described in the R script, \u201crun_shaw.R\u201d. (6) R: This folder contains scripts used to run the analyses for this project. The script \u201crun_shaw.R\u201d is a heavily commented script that functions as a recipe for the entire analysis; going through the directions in run_shaw.R should enable you to reproduce the analysis in this project.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58e6840ce4b09da6799ac85b", "parentId": "5318cbc8e4b0ae6e9d5a3be7", "proj_id": "5318c9ade4b0ae6e9d5a3bd3", "purpose": "These data were used to assess the hydrologic sensitivity of Upper Sheep Creek to changing climate and to aspen mortality.

Significant research has been conducted on the use of science in decision making, in general, and more recently on the use of such tools as vulnerability assessments (VAs), integrated assessments, and ecological and ecosystems assessments, in decision making. Findings have shown that significant barriers and constraints are in place for the integration of climate science into traditional institutional methods of decision making or planning (Leonard, et al 2008; Lindquist 2010, 2011). This research focused on the Great Basin region of the western United States (represented institutionally by the Great Basin Landscape Conservation Cooperative - GBLCC) to develop a comprehensive understanding of the use of climate science in the region, the availability and utility of vulnerability assessment for decision makers, and the science and information gaps that continue to exist for intended users. Through the development of a comprehensive literature review and an on-line survey of Great Basin related stakeholders and decision makers, research suggests that vulnerability assessments (VAs) as a general decision tool are not well understood, accepted or applied in the decision context in the Great Basin study area. The significant number of VAs available and the lack of awareness of these tools, as well as competition among decision tools in general contribute to this situation. Considering this situation, however, the utility of VAs in general, for natural resource decision making has yet to be fully explored.

Though these data may exist for particular wetlands, there are no wall-to-wall consistent datasets of wetland location and long-term hydrological dynamics. Climate change has emphasized the growing need to plan conservation actions across large landscapes and at a longer-term time scales.

Helping these wetlands continue to provide habitat and other services requires understanding how these flooding and drying patterns (their hydrology) have changed in the past, and how projected changes in climate might affect them. The goal of this project was to develop wall-to-wall maps of wetlands across the region, coupled with detailed 30-year hydrographs of historical (1984-2014) fluctuations in water extent for each wetland, and similar 30-year hydrographs for fluctuations expected under future (2070-2099) climate. We developed these products using Landsat satellite images to map surface water extent of wetlands. We then combined these data with VIC, a hydrological model that calculates soil moisture metrics given particular climate data. We quantified the relationships between surface water extent and the VIC metrics produced using historical climate information. We then applied these relationships to soil moisture metrics obtained by running VIC using projected future climate, which allowed us to make projections of expected water extent under endof-the-century climate. Our findings suggest that wetlands in the Columbia Plateau will respond differently across the region. Groundwater driven wetlands, which tend to be more permanently flooded, may see increases in water levels and dry less frequently. Surface water driven wetlands, which tend to be more seasonally flooded, may see decrease in surface water levels, dry more frequently, and dry earlier in the season.

The resulting ultra\u2010high\u2010resolution (sub\u2010decimeter\u2010resolution) imagery has high information content, but automating the extraction of this information to create accurate, wall\u2010to\u2010wall land\u2010cover maps is quite difficult. We introduce image\u2010processing workflows that are based on open\u2010source software and can be used to create land\u2010cover maps from ultra\u2010high\u2010resolution aerial imagery. We compared four machine\u2010learning workflows for classifying images. Two workflows were based on random forest algorithms. Of these, one used a pixel\u2010by\u2010pixel approach available in ilastik, and the other used image segments and was implemented with R and the Orfeo ToolBox. The other two workflows used fully connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks implemented with Nenetic. We applied the four workflows to aerial photographs acquired in the Great Basin (western USA) at flying heights of 10 m, 45 m and 90 m above ground level.

This framework employs a 1\u2010dimensional linearized Boussinesq equation with a superimposed solution for changes in storage due to groundwater upwelling and evapotranspiration, calculated explicitly using the White method. The model and assumptions gave rise to predictions in good agreement with field data from the Middle Fork John Day watershed in Oregon, USA. While raising channel beds can increase total water storage via increases in water table elevation in upland valley bottoms, the contributions of both lateral and longitudinal drainage from restored floodplains to late\u2010summer streamflow were found to be undetectably small, while losses in streamflow due to greater transpiration, lower hydraulic gradients, and less laterally drainable pore volume were likely to be substantial. Although late\u2010summer streamflow increases should not be expected as a direct result of wet\u2010meadow restoration, these approaches offer benefits for improving the quality and health of riparian and meadow vegetation that would warrant considering such measures, even at the cost of increased water demand and reduced streamflow.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b6c3d50e4b006a11f7b47b1", "parentId": "55c4b09be4b033ef52106e6e", "proj_id": "55c3f09de4b033ef52106cc4", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5b6c3d50e4b006a11f7b47b1"}, "589e2d40e4b099f50d3a0745": {"title": "Assessing the role of climate and resource management on groundwater dependent ecosystem changes in arid environments with the Landsat archive", "contacts": [{"name": "Justin  Huntington", "type": "Author", "email": "Justin.Huntington@dri.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Kenneth McGwire", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Charles Morton", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Keirith Snyder", "type": "Author", "email": "kasnyder@unr.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Sarah Peterson", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Tyler Erickson", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Richard Niswonger", "type": "Author", "email": "rniswon@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Hydrologist", "orcId": "0000-0001-6397-2403"}, {"name": "Rosemary Carroll", "type": "Author", "email": "rosemary.carroll@dri.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Guy Smith", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Richard Allen", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Northwest CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "Abstract (from http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425716302619): Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) rely on near-surface groundwater. These systems are receiving more attention with rising air temperature, prolonged drought, and where groundwater pumping captures natural groundwater discharge for anthropogenic use. Phreatophyte shrublands, meadows, and riparian areas are GDEs that provide critical habitat for many sensitive species, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. While GDEs are vital for ecosystem services and function, their long-term (i.e. ~ 30 years) spatial and temporal variability is poorly understood with respect to local and regional scale climate, groundwater, and rangeland management. In this work, we compute time series of NDVI derived from sensors of the Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI lineage for assessing GDEs in a variety of land and water management contexts. Changes in vegetation vigor based on climate, groundwater availability, and land management in arid landscapes are detectable with Landsat. However, the effective quantification of these ecosystem changes can be undermined if changes in spectral bandwidths between different Landsat sensors introduce biases in derived vegetation indices, and if climate, and land and water management histories are not well understood. The objective of this work is to 1) use the Landsat 8 under-fly dataset to quantify differences in spectral reflectance and NDVI between Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI for a range of vegetation communities in arid and semiarid regions of the southwestern United States, and 2) demonstrate the value of 30-year historical vegetation index and climate datasets for assessing GDEs. Specific study areas were chosen to represent a range of GDEs and environmental conditions important for three scenarios: baseline monitoring of vegetation and climate, riparian restoration, and groundwater level changes. Google's Earth Engine cloud computing and environmental monitoring platform is used to rapidly access and analyze the Landsat archive along with downscaled North American Land Data Assimilation System gridded meteorological data, which are used for both atmospheric correction and correlation analysis. Results from the cross-sensor comparison indicate a benefit from the application of a consistent atmospheric correction method, and that NDVI derived from Landsat 7 and 8 are very similar within the study area. Results from continuous Landsat time series analysis clearly illustrate that there are strong correlations between changes in vegetation vigor, precipitation, evaporative demand, depth to groundwater, and riparian restoration. Trends in summer NDVI associated with riparian restoration and groundwater level changes were found to be statistically significant, and interannual summer NDVI was found to be moderately correlated to interannual water-year precipitation for baseline study sites. Results clearly highlight the complementary relationship between water-year PPT, NDVI, and evaporative demand, and are consistent with regional vegetation index and complementary relationship studies.

The urgency of this issue has fostered partnerships between private landowners and public natural resource managers to find solutions. The use of North American beaver (Castor canadensis) to increase surface water in arid landscapes is one pre-emptive measure that is gaining interest because of the remarkable ability of beavers to impound water. In places where beaver are no longer present, some landowners and managers are installing artificial structures made of rock and wood with the intention of mimicking effects of beaver dams. Although this ecosystem engineering is enticing, few scientific studies have been conducted to evaluate these practices. As an initial assessment, we conducted an inventory of all beaver-related restoration projects to date in rangeland streams across the western US. Preliminary results suggest that the relocation of nuisance beaver into unoccupied habitats is the most common practice of the nearly 100 projects surveyed. The primary goals of projects were increasing storage of surface water, followed by restoring riparian vegetation, reducing sedimentation, and improving habitat for fish and wildlife. Installation of artificial structures with names like \u201cbeaver dam analogues\u201d and \u201cartificial beaver dams\u201d is less common, but increasing since 2005. Some projects installed hundreds of these structures. We found little effort to monitor project outcomes and an incomplete understanding of their ecological and hydro-geomorphic effects. Better monitoring of project outcomes would provide much-needed empirical data and, to meet this need, we developed a biodiversity assessment protocol using environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from water samples. We sampled 11 streams across a range of project types. Preliminary results suggest this approach provides important biological information about species occupancy as well as possible relative information about stream condition and recovery trajectories.

Translocation of beavers into formerly occupied habitats, restoration activities encouraging beaver recolonization, and instream structures mimicking the effects of beaver dams are restoration alternatives that have recently gained popularity because of their potential socioeconomic and ecological benefits. However, beaver dams and dam-like structures also harbor a history of social conflict. Hence, we identified a need to assess the use of beaver-related restoration projects in western rangelands to increase awareness and accountability, and identify gaps in scientific knowledge. We inventoried 97 projects implemented by 32 organizations, most in the last 10 years. We found that beaver-related stream restoration projects undertaken mostly involved the relocation of nuisance beavers. The most common goal was to store water, either with beaver dams or artificial structures. Beavers were often moved without regard to genetics, disease, or potential conflicts with nearby landowners. Few projects included post-implementation monitoring or planned for longer term issues, such as what happens when beavers abandon a site or when beaver dams or structures breach. Human dimensions were rarely considered and water rights and other issues were mostly unresolved or addressed through ad-hoc agreements. We conclude that the practice and implementation of beaver-related restoration has outpaced research on its efficacy and best practices.

The basin was split into subbasins for specific regional climatic calibrations and finer resolution characterization. The model was calibrated and performed well against data of glacier mass balance, glacier area change, snow cover, gaged streamflow, evapotranspiration, and solar radiation. Ice melt contributed 26% of the total basin streamflow, with differences temporally from climate oscillations. Furthermore, differences were seen geographically in subbasins depending on the state of the glaciers in each subbasin. Decreasing trends in ice melt volume were mostly seen on smaller steeper glaciers responding to a critical level of glacier recession, while increasing trends in ice melt volume were mostly seen on larger valley glaciers responding to increasing temperature.

A formal Memorandum of Understanding was developed between Oregon State University and the PGST to guide this culturally sensitive research. We recommend this formal approach to researchers considering tribal partnerships in order to ensure expectations of all parties are clearly outlined. During formal interviews and informal conversation, PGST elders mentioned 37 plants, of which eight terrestrial species and a group of marine taxa were of particular concern due to limited availabilities in 26 traditional gathering locations within the Usual and Accustomed (U&amp;A) gathering area guaranteed by the 1855 Point No Point Treaty. Landsat data were used to analyze recent changes in land cover within the U&amp;A. Substantial changes in land cover were found between 1975 and 2010. Detailed analysis for 1990-2010 documented recent forest fragmentation, loss of freshwater wetlands, and both losses and gains of saltwater wetlands. Current regional distribution and autecological information for the eight focal terrestrial species were compiled using available databases, herbarium records, and literature. Field studies documented plant communities in which selected focal species are currently found.  Downscaled results from existing Pacific Northwest climate scenarios were adapted to the Olympic and Kitsap Peninsula, which house the U&amp;A. These suggest somewhat hotter, drier summers and somewhat warmer, wetter conditions in other seasons by the late 21st century. Likely changes in seasonal precipitation were less clear, with uncertainty regarding the magnitude and even direction of change. Published information related to climate variables for the eight focal species was sparse, making even semi-quantitative projections of response to changing climates impossible.

The intimate connections that tribes have maintained with the natural environment are more spiritually rich and complex than non-Native consumptive views of natural resources. After careful consideration of tribe size, level of cultural activity, strength of ties to the environment, and connection to culturally significant and aboriginal geographic regions, three Northwest tribes were selected for this study--the Confederated Tribes of Salish and Kootenai, the Qinault Indian Nation, and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians. Information was collected through interviews with tribal elders and individuals with substantial cultural expertise. We found that in addition to changes in specific cultural practices, a profound disruption to identity connected with (a) changes in seasonality, disturbing the sense of natural time; and (b) a sense that wisdom passed down through generations is no longer a sound basis for which decisions are made. These observations contribute to the understanding of Northwest tribal culture and its vulnerability and adaptive capacity to a changing climate.

Although several approaches have been proposed for assessing the vulnerability of species to climate change, it is unclear whether these approaches are likely to produce similar results. In this study, we compared the relative vulnerabilities to climate change of 76 species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and trees based on three different approaches to assessing vulnerability. We compared (1) projected shifts in species distributions to (2) an assessment based on expert opinion and projected changes in climate to (3) an approach based on the current and future climatic conditions within species\u2019 current ranges. We found that the three approaches provided substantially different rankings of the species. Some species were determined to be highly vulnerable by one approach but only moderately vulnerable by the other two approaches. Only one species, the caribou, was consistently ranked in the top ten most vulnerable species by all three approaches. This is not entirely surprising given that the three measures assess different aspects of vulnerability and are based on different types of information. Nonetheless, these results are important because they indicate that more than one approach may be needed to adequately assess vulnerability\u2014and that basing management decisions on one approach alone may lead scientists and managers to underestimate vulnerability.

We assessed the relative vulnerability to climate change of 11 tree species in western North America using a multivariate approach to quantify elements of sensitivity to climate change, exposure to climate change, and the capacity to adapt to climate change. Our assessment was based on a combination of expert knowledge, published studies, and projected changes in climate. Of the 11 species, Garry oak ( Quercus garryana) was determined to be the most vulnerable, largely because of its relatively high sensitivity. Garry oak occupies some of the driest low woodland and savanna sites from British Columbia to California and is highly dependent on disturbances, such as periodic, low intensity fire. Big leaf maple ( Acer macrophyllum) was determined to be the least vulnerable, largely because of its adaptive capacity. Big leaf maple can reproduce quickly after disturbances and its seeds can disperse long distances potentially allowing it to move in response to a changing climate.

Stacks of univariate, independently developed vegetation layers may not represent relationships between each variable that can be characterized by multivariate modeling techniques, leading to inaccurate inferences on the distribution of suitable habitat. In this paper, we examine the role of variable combining in mapping multiple dimensions of greater sage\u2010grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus, GRSG) habitat as a basis for GRSG conservation in the great basin ecoregion within southeastern Oregon. We compare two modeling approaches: a univariate random forest regression model (RF regression) and a multivariate random forest nearest neighbor (RFNN) imputation model , across an array of variables. These include five GRSG habitat descriptor variables: percent cover of trees, juniper, sagebrush, and GRSG food forbs, and the proportion of grasses that are exotic annuals. We also model species distributions of 51 common species in the sage steppe and combine these predictions to estimate alpha diversity. Our results show that RF regression and RFNN can yield univariate predictions with similar performance, but RF regression predictions tend to contain slightly more bias at broader spatial scales. Stacking univariate predictions from RF regression yields covariance errors that manifest as logical errors (juniper cover &gt; tree cover), biases in estimates of GRSG habitat area, and biases in estimates of alpha diversity. Combining variables from the RFNN model does not introduce covariance errors. We conclude that multivariate modeling approaches are better suited to map multidimensional habitat niches at broader spatial scales, and also better suited to provide information for defining multivariable adaptive management triggers at the population level or above.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5da77632e4b09fd3b0c9c183", "parentId": "50465355e4b0241d49d62c8b", "proj_id": "5006e784e4b0abf7ce733f4d", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5da77632e4b09fd3b0c9c183"}, "5537c7b9e4b0b22a1580872e": {"title": "Climate change and land management impact rangeland condition and sage-grouse habitat in southeastern Oregon", "contacts": [{"name": "Megan K.

To effectively manage sagebrush steppe landscapes for long-term goals, managers need information about the potential impacts of climate change, disturbances, and management activities. We integrated information from a dynamic global vegetation model, a sage-grouse habitat climate envelope model, and a state-and-transition simulation model to project broad-scale vegetation dynamics and potential sage-grouse habitat across 23.5 million acres in southeastern Oregon. We evaluated four climate scenarios, including continuing current climate and three scenarios of global climate change, and three management scenarios, including no management, current management and a sage-grouse habitat restoration scenario. All climate change scenarios projected expansion of moist shrub steppe and contraction of dry shrub steppe, but climate scenarios varied widely in the projected extent of xeric shrub steppe, where hot, dry summer conditions are unfavorable for sage-grouse. Wildfire increased by 26% over the century under current climate due to exotic grass encroachment, and by two- to four-fold across all climate change scenarios as extreme fire years became more frequent. Exotic grasses rapidly expanded in all scenarios as large areas of the landscape initially in semi-degraded condition converted to exotic-dominated systems. Due to the combination of exotic grass invasion, juniper encroachment, and climatic unsuitability for sage-grouse, projected sage-grouse habitat declined in the first several decades, but increased in area under the three climate change scenarios later in the century, as moist shrub steppe increased and rangeland condition improved. Management activities in the model were generally unsuccessful in controlling exotic grass invasion but were effective in slowing woodland expansion.

The climatic drivers of this recent mortality and the potential for future whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetle are not well understood, yet are important considerations in whether to list whitebark pine as a threatened or endangered species. We sought to increase the understanding of climate influences on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine forests, which are less well understood than in lodgepole pine, by quantifying climate-beetle relationships, analyzing climate influences during the recent outbreak, and estimating the suitability of future climate for beetle outbreaks. We developed a statistical model of the probability of whitebark pine mortality in the GYE that included temperature effects on beetle development and survival, precipitation effects on host tree condition, beetle population size, and stand characteristics. Estimated probability of whitebark pine mortality increased with higher winter minimum temperature, indicating greater beetle winter survival; higher fall temperature, indicating synchronous beetle emergence; lower two-year summer precipitation, indicating increased potential for host tree stress; increasing beetle populations; stand age; and increasing percent composition of whitebark pine within a stand. The recent outbreak occurred during a period of higher-than-normal regional winter temperatures, suitable fall temperatures, and low summer precipitation. In contrast to lodgepole pine systems, area with mortality was linked to precipitation variability even at high beetle populations. Projections from climate models indicate future climate conditions will likely provide favorable conditions for beetle outbreaks within nearly all current whitebark pine habitat in the GYE by the middle of this century. Therefore, when surviving and regenerating trees reach ages suitable for beetle attack, there is strong potential for continued whitebark pine mortality due to mountain pine beetle.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57c3a83ce4b0f2f0cebb7b3e", "parentId": "50465652e4b0241d49d62c9a", "proj_id": "5006c438e4b0abf7ce733f44", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57c3a83ce4b0f2f0cebb7b3e"}, "597a6554e4b0a38ca273dc65": {"title": "Recent and future climate suitability for whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetles varies across the western US", "contacts": [{"name": "Polly C.Buotte", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Jeffrey A.Hicke", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Haiganoush K.Preisler", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "John T.Abatzoglou", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Kenneth F.Raffa", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Jesse A.Logan", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Northwest CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "Abstract (from http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112717303249): Recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine forests have been extensive and severe. Understanding the climate influences on these outbreaks is essential for developing management plans that account for potential future mountain pine beetle outbreaks, among other threats, and informing listing decisions under the Endangered Species Act. Prior research has focused on one geographic region, but geographic variability in beetle and tree physiological responses to climate conditions have been documented. Here we evaluate geographic variability in climate influences on recent beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine and estimate future climate suitability for outbreaks across much of the range of whitebark pine in the western US. To accomplish these objectives, we developed and analyzed statistical models for three different geographic regions as well as a Westwide model, then applied the Westwide model to a suite of climate projections. The general patterns of climate-tree mortality relationships were similar across the three regions of our study. However, the relative importance of individual climate metrics preceding and during the recent outbreaks varied geographically because of the different climates in the regions. Winter minimum temperatures appeared to be limiting prior to outbreaks in the colder regions. All regions experienced low summer precipitation prior to or during outbreak initiation. Future climate suitability for beetle outbreaks is estimated to increase or remain stable in the coldest regions and decline slightly in the warmest region by the end of this century. Across the study area, projections of higher winter temperatures and decreased summer precipitation (with lower confidence than for temperatures) contribute to increased climate suitability for outbreaks, while projected higher fall/spring/summer temperatures contribute to decreased suitability. Some regional variability exists; in particular, the effect of winter warming is muted in the warmest region (Cascades) where winter temperatures appear to be less limiting. However, all regions are projected to experience fewer years with very low suitability, which commonly occurred prior to the recent outbreaks and may have limited beetle populations. Given the inherent uncertainty in climate projections and ecological responses to novel climates, management plans that incorporate sites that are expected to experience a range of expected future climate conditions might increase the chances of whitebark pine persistence in a warmer future.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/597a6554e4b0a38ca273dc65", "parentId": "50465652e4b0241d49d62c9a", "proj_id": "5006c438e4b0abf7ce733f44", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=597a6554e4b0a38ca273dc65"}, "53e8c36fe4b02d190f05dd8c": {"title": "\"Improving Understanding of Threats to Whitebark Pine in the Western US\" Project Final Report", "contacts": [{"name": "Jeffrey A.

Here we combine long-term genetic monitoring data with high-resolution climate and stream temperature predictions to evaluate how recent climate warming has influenced the spatio-temporal spread of human-mediated hybridization between threatened native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) and non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), the world\u2019s most widely introduced invasive fish4. Despite widespread release of millions of rainbow trout over the past century within the Flathead River system5, a large relatively pristine watershed in western North America, historical samples revealed that hybridization was prevalent only in one (source) population. During a subsequent 30-year period of accelerated warming, hybridization spread rapidly and was strongly linked to interactions between climatic drivers\u2014precipitation and temperature\u2014and distance to the source population.

Nevertheless, few studies have measured how climatic variation influences genetic diversity within populations or how genetic diversity is distributed across space relative to future climatic stress. Here, we tested whether patterns of genetic diversity (allelic richness) were related to climatic variation and habitat features in 130 bull trout (  Salvelinus confluentus) populations from 24 watersheds (i.e., ~4\u20137th order river subbasins) across the Columbia River Basin, USA. We then determined whether bull trout genetic diversity was related to climate vulnerability at the watershed scale, which we quantified on the basis of exposure to future climatic conditions (projected scenarios for the 2040s) and existing habitat complexity. We found a strong gradient in genetic diversity in bull trout populations across the Columbia River Basin, where populations located in the most upstream headwater areas had the greatest genetic diversity. After accounting for spatial patterns with linear mixed models, allelic richness in bull trout populations was positively related to habitat patch size and complexity, and negatively related to maximum summer temperature and the frequency of winter flooding. These relationships strongly suggest that climatic variation influences evolutionary processes in this threatened species and that genetic diversity will likely decrease due to future climate change. Vulnerability at a watershed scale was negatively correlated with average genetic diversity (  r =   \u22120.77;   P &lt;   0.001); watersheds containing populations with lower average genetic diversity generally had the lowest habitat complexity, warmest stream temperatures, and greatest frequency of winter flooding.

Here, we introduce a novel modeling framework for aquatic systems that integrates spatially-explicit, individual-based, demographic and genetic (demogenetic) assessments with environmental variables. To show its potential utility, we simulated a hypothetical network of 19 migratory riverine populations (e.g., salmonids) using a riverscape connectivity and demogenetic model (CDFISH). We assessed how stream resistance to movement -- a function of water temperature, fluvial distance, and physical barriers -- might influence demogenetic connectivity and hence population vulnerability. We present demographic metrics (abundance, immigration, and change in abundance) and also genetic metrics (diversity, differentiation, and change in differentiation), and combine them into a single vulnerability index for identifying populations at risk of extirpation. We considered four realistic scenarios that illustrate the relative sensitivity of these metrics for early detection of reduced connectivity: (1) maximum resistance due to high water temperatures throughout the network, (2) minimum resistance due to low water temperatures throughout the network, (3) increased resistance at a tributary junction caused by a partial barrier, and (4) complete isolation of a tributary, leaving resident individuals only. We then apply this demogenetic framework using empirical data for a bull trout metapopulation in the upper Flathead River system, Canada and USA, to assess how current and predicted future stream warming may influence population vulnerability. Results suggest that warmer water temperatures and associated barriers to movement (e.g., low flows, de-watering) are predicted to fragment suitable habitat for migratory salmonids, resulting in the loss of genetic diversity and reduced sizes in certain vulnerable population.

The UVB algorithm calculates a first-pass estimate of UVB using a GIS cost-distance approach (distance from stream times ground slope), and results are refined using a valley-filling procedure where a valley is \u201cflooded\u201d to a set flood height above the stream channel elevation. The flood height is set as a user-defined \u201cflood factor\u201d multiplied by bankfull depth. We used a flood factor of 6 in this analysis. The flood height is spread outward from the stream until it intersects a valley wall, and is further confined by a user-defined maximum ground slope (9%) and max valley width, which we set to 2000 m.  We used an annual mean precipitation value of 150 cm for the study area, and all other variables in the algorithm were set to defaults. Further details on the algorithm can be found in Nagel et al.

Demographic compensation among life\u2010history stages has the potential to buffer populations from decline, but alternatively, compounding negative effects can lead to accelerated population decline and extinction. In montane ecosystems of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, increasing temperatures are resulting in a transition from snow\u2010dominated to rain\u2010dominated precipitation events, reducing snowpack. For ectotherms such as amphibians, warmer winters can reduce the frequency of critical minimum temperatures and increase the length of summer growing seasons, benefiting post\u2010metamorphic stages, but may also increase metabolic costs during winter months, which could decrease survival. Lower snowpack levels also result in wetlands that dry sooner or more frequently in the summer, increasing larval desiccation risk. To evaluate how these challenges and opportunities compound within a species\u2019 life history, we collected demographic data on Cascades frog (Rana cascadae) in Olympic National Park in Washington state to parameterize stage\u2010based stochastic matrix population models under current and future (A1B, 2040s, and 2080s) environmental conditions. We estimated the proportion of reproductive effort lost each year due to drying using watershed\u2010specific hydrologic models, and coupled this with an analysis that relates 15 yr of R. cascadae abundance data with a suite of climate variables. We estimated the current population growth (\u03bbs) to be 0.97 (95% CI 0.84\u20131.13), but predict that \u03bbs will decline under continued climate warming, resulting in a 62% chance of extinction by the 2080s because of compounding negative effects on early and late life history stages. By the 2080s, our models predict that larval mortality will increase by 17% as a result of increased pond drying, and adult survival will decrease by 7% as winter length and summer precipitation continue to decrease. We find that reduced larval survival drives initial declines in the 2040s, but further declines in the 2080s are compounded by decreases in adult survival.

This is especially true when monitoring hydrologic change at scales below 30 m, the resolution of one Landsat pixel. To address this, we used spectral mixture analysis (SMA) of a time series of Landsat satellite imagery to reconstruct surface-water hydrographs for 750 wetlands in Douglas County, Washington State, USA, from 1984 to 2011. SMA estimates the fractional abundance of spectra representing physically meaningful materials, known as spectral endmembers, which comprise a mixed pixel, thus providing sub-pixel estimates of surface water extent. Endmembers for water and sage steppe were selected directly from each image scene in the Landsat time series, whereas endmembers for salt and wetland vegetation were derived from a mean spectral signature of selected dates spanning the 1984\u20132011 timeframe.

Despite their importance and climate sensitivity, wetlands tend to be understudied due to a lack of tools and data relative to what is available for other ecosystem types. Here, we develop and demonstrate a new method for projecting climate-induced hydrologic changes in montane wetlands. Using observed wetland water levels and soil moisture simulated by the physically based Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model, we developed site-specific regression models relating soil moisture to observed wetland water levels to simulate the hydrologic behavior of four types of montane wetlands (ephemeral, intermediate, perennial, permanent wetlands) in the U. S. Pacific Northwest. The hybrid models captured observed wetland dynamics in many cases, though were less robust in others. We then used these models to a) hindcast historical wetland behavior in response to observed climate variability (1916\u20132010 or later) and classify wetland types, and b) project the impacts of climate change on montane wetlands using global climate model scenarios for the 2040s and 2080s (A1B emissions scenario). These future projections show that climate-induced changes to key driving variables (reduced snowpack, higher evapotranspiration, extended summer drought) will result in earlier and faster drawdown in Pacific Northwest montane wetlands, leading to systematic reductions in water levels, shortened wetland hydroperiods, and increased probability of drying.

Wetlands challenge our current scientific capacity because of their sheer number, their wide range of sizes, and their dynamic nature. As a result, wetlands are understudied compared to other ecosystem types. However, wetlands are thought to be among the most sensitive ecosystems to climate change, so the lack of dedicated scientific resources has accelerating consequences going forward. Our goal in this project was to address the deficiency in wetland resources by developing new approaches and technical tools to better understand wetlands in general and to more effectively manage and conserve wetlands under a changing climate. By focusing our efforts on a range of wetland types, our goal was to better characterize landscape-scale climate change impacts to wetlands across the Pacific Northwest region in support of ongoing assessment and adaptation efforts. Our approach was designed in collaboration with natural resource managers, and involved three methodological advances. First, using remote sensing approaches, we developed new methods for mapping wetlands and reconstructing historical wetland hydrologic dynamics. Second, we used the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, a regional-scale hydrologic model, to hindcast historical wetland dynamics and project the future impacts of climate change on wetlands. Third, we linked these approaches with ecological data to evaluate the impacts and risk of climate change to several classes of wetlands across three ecoregions of Washington state.

Beginning in the late 1800s and expanding after World War II, fish and wildlife managers intentionally introduced millions of predatory trout (primarily  Oncorhynchus  spp) into fishless mountain ponds and lakes across the western states. These new top predators, which now occupy 95% of large mountain lakes, have limited the habitat distributions of native frogs, salamanders, and wetland invertebrates to smaller, more ephemeral ponds where trout do not survive. Now a second \u201cexperiment\u201d \u2013 anthropogenic climate change \u2013 threatens to eliminate many of these ephemeral habitats and shorten wetland hydroperiods. Caught between climate-induced habitat loss and predation from introduced fish, native mountain lake fauna of the western US \u2013 especially amphibians \u2013 are at risk of extirpation.

However, the diversity of drought indices raises several issues: 1) which indices perform best and where; 2) does the incorporation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) in indices strengthen relationships, and how sensitive is the choice of PET methods to such results; 3) what additional value is added by using higher-spatial-resolution gridded climate layers; and 4) how have observed relationships changed through time. Standardized precipitation index, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), Palmer drought severity index, and water balance runoff (WBR) model output were correlated to water-year runoff for 21 unregulated drainage basins in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. SPEI and WBR with time scales encompassing the primary precipitation season maximized the explained variance in water-year runoff in most basins. Slightly stronger correlations were found using PET estimates from the Penman-Monteith method over the Thornthwaite method, particularly for time periods that incorporated the spring and summer months in basins that receive appreciable precipitation during the growing season.

Annual mean temperature increased by approximately 0.6&deg;\u20130.8&deg;C from 1901 to 2012, with corroborating indicators including a lengthened freeze-free season, increased temperature of the coldest night of the year, and increased growing-season potential evapotranspiration.

Despite increased warming rates in most seasons over the last half century, nonsignificant cooling was observed during spring from 1980 to 2012. Observations show a long-term increase in spring precipitation; however, decreased summer and autumn precipitation and increased potential evapotranspiration have resulted in larger climatic water deficits over the past four decades. A bootstrapped multiple linear regression model was used to better resolve the temporal heterogeneity of seasonal temperature and precipitation trends and to apportion trends to internal climate variability, solar variability, volcanic aerosols, and anthropogenic forcing. The El Ni&ntilde;o\u2013Southern Oscillation and the Pacific\u2013North American pattern were the primary modulators of seasonal temperature trends on multidecadal time scales: solar and volcanic forcing were nonsignificant predictors and contributed weakly to observed trends.

The results suggest that precipitation has been the primary control of runoff variation during the latest decades, but the role of temperature will outweigh that of precipitation in most regions if future climate change follows the projections of climate models instead of the historical tendencies. Besides these two key factors, increasing air humidity is projected to partially offset the additional evaporative demand caused by warming and consequently enhance runoff. Overall, the projections from 20 climate models suggest a high degree of consistency on the increasing trends in temperature, precipitation, and humidity, which will be the major climatic driving factors accounting for 43\u201350, 20\u201324, and 16\u201323\u202f% of the runoff change, respectively.

Will they be stable or unstable? Will the waters be cold and clear or warm and muddy? Will they have salmon or other species? These questions motivated our two-year study of climate warming effects on headwater streams draining the Cascade Mountains. Using a novel combination of snow, geohydrology, and sediment transport models we assessed the vulnerability of stream channels to changing peak streamflow. Our snow modeling shows that with just a 2\u00b0C warming, snowfall shifts to rainfall at all elevations, peak snowpacks occur over two months earlier, and snowpacks are reduced by over half of historical values. Our geohydrology modeling shows that greater rainfall and earlier snowmelt enhances peak winter streamflows but impacts depend on snow amount and watershed geohydrology. In spring-fed watersheds, increased winter flows are within historical bounds. In runoff-dominated watersheds, increased winter flows will exceed the historical range by up to 44% and the frequency of high flows will increase by over 100 days per year. Since streambed gravels and sand are transported during high flows, climate warming is likely to result in a dramatic increase in the amount of sediment moving through Cascade streams. Daily sediment transport rates in the surface-runoff system could potentially double. Besides affecting water quality with increased levels of suspended sediment, more frequent sediment transport events may lead to instability in the gravels where bull trout and salmon lay their eggs, making their survival less certain in the future. A key aspect of this project was engaging managers through a knowledge- to-action approach.

Data on such heterogeneity could inform mechanistic understanding of factors affecting species distributions as well as efforts to assess and manage coastal species and habitat vulnerability to sea-level rise. Using data on the vertical distribution of common plant species at 12 tidal marshes across the US Pacific coast, we examined heterogeneity in patterns of zonation to test whether distributions varied by site, species, or latitude. Interspecific zonation was evident at most sites, but the vertical niches of co-occurring common species often overlapped considerably. The median elevation of most species varied across marshes, with site-specific differences in marsh elevation profiles more important than differences in latitude that reflect regional climate gradients. Some common species consistently inhabited lower or higher elevations relative to other species, but others varied among sites. Vertical niche breadth varied more than twofold among species. These results indicate that zonation varies by both site and species at the regional scale, and highlight the potential importance of local marsh elevation profiles to plant vertical distributions.

We describe a modelling framework that is applicable to the evaluation of potential changes in urban water quality and associated hydrologic changes in response to ongoing climate and landscape alteration. The grid-based spatially distributed model, Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model-Water Quality (DHSVM-WQ), is an outgrowth of DHSVM that incorporates modules for assessing hydrology and water quality in urbanized watersheds at a high-spatial and high-temporal resolution. DHSVM-WQ simulates surface run-off quality and in-stream processes that control the transport of non-point source pollutants into urban streams. We configure DHSVM-WQ for three partially urbanized catchments in the Puget Sound region to evaluate the water quality responses to current conditions and projected changes in climate and/or land use over the next century. Here, we focus on total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) from non-point sources (run-off), as well as stream temperature. The projection of future land use is characterized by a combination of densification in existing urban or partially urban areas and expansion of the urban footprint. The climate change scenarios consist of individual and concurrent changes in temperature and precipitation. Future precipitation is projected to increase in winter and decrease in summer, while future temperature is projected to increase throughout the year. Our results show that urbanization has a much greater effect than climate change on both the magnitude and seasonal variability of streamflow, TSS and TP loads largely because of substantially increased streamflow and particularly winter flow peaks. Water temperature is more sensitive to climate warming scenarios than to urbanization and precipitation changes. Future urbanization and climate change together are predicted to significantly increase annual mean streamflow (up to 55%), water temperature (up to 1.9\u2009\u00b0C), TSS load (up to 182%) and TP load (up to 74%).

Runs with five downscaling methods reported: a) dBCSD; b) MACA; c) mBCSD; d) NARCCAP; e) sdbcNARCCAP (or bcNARCCAP).    Tasks 2 and 3 share the following characteristics:    1. The downscaled data corresponds to the CCSM3e GCM model run. All downscaling was \u201ctrained\u201d with the gridded Livneh et al., 2013 data set, downloaded in July 2012.    2.  Only 4 pixels of the domain were selected for the figures in the final report of the project and stored in this repository, even though the model was set up and run for the whole pacific northwest domain. Though we carried out runs for 2 scenarios, here we only present the future SRES A2 scenario results.    3. The version of the code used was VIC version 4.1.2.g, with several improvements which have been incorporated into VIC version 4.1.2.h. The compiled executable is included in this directory and the sourcecode can be found online at http://www.hydro.washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/VIC/.     4. The model parameters correspond to those used by Livneh et al., 2013, for the continental US portion of the Pacific Northwest.

We developed a Monte Carlo approach that accounts for uncertainty within generalized linear regression models (parameter uncertainty and residual error), uncertainty among competing models (model uncertainty), and uncertainty in future climate conditions (climate uncertainty) to produce site-specific frequency distributions of occurrence probabilities across a species\u2019 range. We illustrated the method by forecasting suitable habitat for bull trout (  Salvelinus confluentus) in the Interior Columbia River Basin, USA, under recent and projected 2040s and 2080s climate conditions. The 95% interval of total suitable habitat under recent conditions was estimated at 30.1 to 42.5 thousand km; this was predicted to decline to 0.5 to 7.9 thousand km by the 2080s. Projections for the 2080s showed that the great majority of stream segments would be unsuitable with high certainty, regardless of the climate dataset or bull trout model employed. The largest contributor to uncertainty in total suitable habitat was climate uncertainty, followed by parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty. Our approach makes it possible to calculate a full distribution of possible outcomes for a species, and permits ready graphical display of uncertainty for individual locations and of total habitat.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/521619a9e4b02034073db936", "parentId": "502a9e8fe4b0a8e4a0fdb164", "proj_id": "5006f464e4b0abf7ce733f90", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=521619a9e4b02034073db936"}, "54dfc47ce4b08de9379b3a78": {"title": "Final Report for Range-Wide Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Threatened Bull Trout", "contacts": [{"name": "Jason Dunham", "type": "Author", "email": "jdunham@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Supervisory Research Aquatic Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0002-6268-0633"}, {"name": "Northwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Northwest CASC", "fy": "2011", "summary": "Bull Trout is the most cold-adapted fish in freshwaters of the Pacific Northwest.

We used a Bayesian network (BN) approach to evaluate population vulnerability of bull trout (  Salvelinus confluentus) in the Wenatchee River basin, Washington, USA, under current and future climate and fire scenarios. The BN was based on modeled estimates of wildfire, water temperature, and physical habitat prior to, and following, simulated fires throughout the basin. We found that bull trout population vulnerability depended on the extent to which climate effects can be at least partially offset by managing factors such as habitat connectivity and fire size. Moreover, our analysis showed that local management can significantly reduce the vulnerability of bull trout to climate change given appropriate management actions.

Recent evidence indicates that structurally complex old-growth forest can be cooler than other forest types during spring and summer months, thereby offering potential to buffer populations from negative effects of warming. Old growth may also have higher food and nest-site availability for certain species, which could have disproportionate fitness benefits as species approach their thermal limits. We predicted that negative effects of climate change on 30-year population trends of old-growth-associated birds should be dampened in landscapes with high proportions of old-growth forest. We modelled population trends from Breeding Bird Survey data for 13 species as a function of temperature change and proportion old-growth forest.   We found a significant negative effect of summer warming on only two species. However, in both of these species, this relationship between warming and population decline was not only reduced but reversed, in old-growth-dominated landscapes. Across all 13 species, evidence for a buffering effect of old-growth forest increased with the degree to which species were negatively influenced by summer warming. These findings suggest that old-growth forests may buffer the negative effects of climate change for those species that are most sensitive to temperature increases.

Remote-sensing technology offers great potential for predicting species distributions at large scales, but the cost and required expertise are prohibitive for many applications. We test the usefulness of freely available raw remote-sensing reflectance data in predicting species distributions of 40 commonly occurring bird species in western Oregon.          Location       Central Coast Range, Cascade and Klamath Mountains Oregon, USA.          Methods       Information on bird observations was collected from 4598 fixed-radius point counts. Reflectance data were obtained using 30-m resolution Landsat imagery summarized at scales of 150, 500, 1000 and 2000 m. We used boosted regression tree (BRT) models to analyse relationships between distributions of birds and reflectance values and evaluated prediction performance of the models using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values.          Results       Prediction success of models using all reflectance values was high (mean AUC = 0.79 &plusmn; 0.10 SD). Further, model performance using individual reflectance bands exceeded those that used only Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The relative influence of band 4 predictors was highest, indicating the importance of variables associated with vegetation biomass and photosynthetic activity. Across spatial scales, the average influence of predictors at the 2000 m scale was greatest.          Main Conclusions       We demonstrate that unclassified remote-sensing imagery can be used to produce species distribution models with high prediction success. Our study is the first to identify general patterns in the usefulness of spectral reflectances for species distribution modelling of multiple species.

We analyzed historical abundance data of 110 terrestrial bird species sampled from 1983 to 2010 along 406 Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) across the western USA. Using boosted-regression trees, we modeled bird abundance at the beginning of this interval as a function of (1) climate variables, (2) Landsat-derived landcover data, (3) the additive and interactive effects of climate and land-cover variables. We evaluated the capacity of each model set to predict observed 27-year bird population trends. On average, 45 species significantly declined over the period observed and only 8 increased (mean trend = \u22120.84%/year). Climate change alone significantly predicted observed abundance trends for 44/108 species (mean 0.37 \u00b1 0.09 [SD]), land-cover changes alone predicted trends for 47/108 species (mean r = 0.36 \u00b1 0.09), and the synergistic effects predicted 59/108 species (mean r = 0.37 \u00b1 0.11).

Across stressors, species with trends that were predicted accurately were more likely to be in decline across the western USA.

We provide the first empirical evidence that abundance models based on land cover and climate have the capacity to predict the species most likely to be at risk from climate and land-use change.

We used long-term data on bird distributions and abundance covering five states in the western US and in the Canadian province of British Columbia to test the capacity of statistical models to predict temporal changes in bird populations over a 32-year period. Using boosted regression trees, we built presence-absence and abundance models that related the presence and abundance of 132 bird species to spatial variation in climatic conditions.

This study provides an approach that combines genetic markers and landscape analyses to delineate populations, estimate fragmentation and connectivity in sage-grouse populations, and potentially identify underlying causes that limit connectivity and isolate populations. State and federal agencies are focusing current management actions for greater sage-grouse in core areas containing the highest densities of breeding birds. The core area approach permits limited resources to be applied in regions that will have the greatest potential to benefit the largest proportion of sage-grouse. As a trade-off, energy and other development then can proceed on public lands in areas outside of the core distributions, thus impacting only a small percentage of the sage-grouse in that area. This relatively simple concept of designating areas for sage-grouse conservation but permitting development in surrounding regions has the unwanted potential to fragment sagebrush habitat and increase isolation of individual sage-grouse populations. Information on gene flow and rates of genetic exchange derived from this study will be used to test the efficacy of this conservation model. The range-wide distribution of greater sage-grouse may consist primarily of a few large core populations surrounded by numerous small populations. The viability of many of these small populations may be sustained by dispersing individuals from neighboring populations. Development that causes habitat loss or creates barriers to dispersal between core areas has the potential to restrict movements important to maintain genetic diversity, augment small populations, or recolonize extirpated populations. Thus, an analysis of movement among sage-grouse populations is needed to assess levels of connectivity among core areas, and to identify and delineate features that may act as barriers to movement. Although other methods have been used regionally (radio-tracking, banding) to assess sage-grouse movement, the most efficient and informative approach uses molecular genetic techniques. Genetic methods are less costly, allow for investigations over broader spatial extents, and measure the actual breeding consequences of animal movement. In addition to defining populations and measuring connectivity, genetic approaches also address many other relevant questions including the conservation of genetic diversity, the impacts of inbreeding, and the association among landscape and geographic characteristics, habitats, and genetics.

Increasingly, current management is focused on core or priority areas containing the highest densities of breeding birds with little regard to understanding connectivity within and among areas. The most fundamental objective of species conservation is to first identify and subsequently maintain a set of viable and connected populations. Therefore, if management emphasis on core areas is to be successful for long-term conservation, it is important to know (1) the spatial delineation of breeding populations across the range-wide distribution of sage-grouse, (2) how primary populations located in high quality habitat are interconnected across regions of lower population densities and less suitable habitat, and (3) the spatial scale and relative importance of landscape features that influence gene flow.    The working model for spatial organization of the range-wide distribution of sage-grouse likely consists primarily of numerous small populations in the periphery surrounding large core populations. In this study, we used non-invasive genetic data obtained from feathers collected at leks (breeding locations) to test this model and to understand the processes that underlie the spatial pattern of populations. Genetic data provide unique information on individual movements or dispersals and subsequent mating, as expressed through gene flow. Barriers to dispersal can fragment large populations, restrict exchange among small populations, and limit the ability of populations to respond to environmental stressors or changes in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) land cover. Therefore, understanding how individuals disperse within and among breeding populations is important for maintaining genetic diversity, to sustain populations that are experiencing declining trends, or to recolonize extirpated populations when suitable habitat remains.    We will first use information on genetic relatedness derived from individual-, lek-, and population-based analyses to better delineate the range-wide network of breeding populations. We will then combine genetic data with landscape models of cost-surfaces to identify characteristics of barriers, including geographic distance, topographic features, and anthropogenic land uses that influence dispersal and genetic exchange. These results are important for incorporating landscape and genetic connectivity into conservation planning to delineate core or priority populations, and to reduce population fragmentation, isolation, and subsequent risk of extirpation.

Diagnostic plots demonstrated that in about half of the measurements sets, Kfs could be estimated by modeling infiltration as a two-term function of sorptivity and Kfs. In the remaining plots, additional unknown factors that influenced infiltration prevented estimation of Kfs, possibly due to air entrapment, soil layering, or ring insertion effects in the remaining experiments.

Predictions correspond to any pixel on the channel network consistent with the medium resolution National Hydrography Dataset channel network stream grid. Total annual precipitation and percent forest cover were consistently the most important predictor variables among global and most subregional models, which had error rates between 17 and 22%. Probabilities were converted to wet and dry streamflow permanence classes with an associated confidence. Wet and dry classifications were used to derive descriptors that characterize the statistical and spatial distribution of streamflow permanence in three focal basins. Predicted dry channel segments account for 52\u201392% of the stream network across the three focal basins; streamflow permanence decreased during climatically drier years.

The classifications of \u201cstreamflow permanence\u201d were primarily established in the middle 20th century and are often outdated and inaccurate today if they were not adjusted for changes in land use, wildfires, or climate. Understanding where streams are perennial is important for a variety of reasons. For example, perennial streams receive special regulatory protections under a variety of statutes, and provide important habitat for fish, wildlife, and other species. To predict the likelihood that streams are perennial, we compiled nearly 25,000 observations of wet/dry conditions in streams across the Pacific Northwest from various state and federal agency databases. Field collection of those data alone would cost many millions of dollars. Processing of these data and the spatial environmental data to predict the likelihood that streams are perennial required several innovative steps with data processing and statistical analyses. The end products from this effort are peer-reviewed and publicly available regional datasets, models, and maps of where perennial streams are across the Pacific Northwest and how they respond to year-to-year variation in climate conditions, such as annual snow and rainfall. By engaging managers throughout the life of the project and presenting model findings in numerous forums, we are confident our products will be directly applied by managers and the general public to address water availability in the context of drought and other climate-related changes in the region.

We calculated Tasseled Cap Greenness, a metric of plant biomass, using remotely sensed data available in the Landsat archive to assess how recent climate variation has affected biomass production and plant phenology across three maritime tidal marshes in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. First, we used clipped vegetation plots at one of our sites to confirm that tasseled cap greenness provided a useful measure of aboveground biomass (r2\u202f=\u202f0.72). We then used multiple measures of biomass each growing season over 20\u201325 years per study site and developed models to test how peak biomass and the date of peak biomass varied with 94 climate and sea-level metrics using generalized linear models and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) model selection. Peak biomass was positively related to total annual precipitation, while the best predictor for date of peak biomass was average growing season temperature, with the peak 7.2 days earlier per degree C.

For example, because climate change may alter the frequency, duration, or severity of droughts, small habitats that naturally retain water (drought refugia) may become increasingly important to many natural wildlife communities.

Springs that are expected to maintain their ecohydrologic function in a warmer, drier climate may be priorities for conservation and restoration. Identifying such springs is difficult because many springs lack hydrologic records of adequate temporal extent and resolution to assess their resilience to water cycle changes. This study demonstrates proof\u2010of\u2010concept for the assessment of certain spring types (i.e., helocrene, hypocrene, and hillslope springs) in terms of hydrologic and ecological resilience to climatic water stress using freely available remote\u2010sensing and climate data. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1985 through 2011 to delineate surface\u2010moisture zones (SMZs) associated with 39 clusters of 172 springs in a montane sage\u2010steppe landscape in southeastern Oregon, USA.

Because all resilience indicators were highly inter\u2010correlated, we derived an overall metric of SMZ resilience using principal components analysis that accounted for 66% of total variance. This overall resilience score was positively correlated with SMZ elevation, slope, mean annual precipitation, and with the number of associated springs.

We mapped potential climatic refugia in the future across North America, defined as locations with increasingly rare climatic conditions. We identified these locations by tracking projected changes in the size and distribution of climate analogs over time. We used biologically derived thresholds to define analogs and tested the impacts of dispersal limitation with 4 distances to limit analog searches. We identified at most 12% of North America as potential climatic refugia. Refugia extent varied depending on the analog threshold, dispersal distance, and climate projection. However, in all cases refugia were concentrated at high elevations and in topographically complex regions. Refugia identified using different climate projections were largely nested, suggesting that identified refugia were relatively robust to climate\u2010projection selection. Existing conservation areas cover approximately 10% of North America and yet protected up to 25% of identified refugia, indicating that protected areas disproportionately include refugia. Refugia located at lower latitudes (\u226440\u00b0N) and slightly lower elevations (approximately 2500 m) were more likely to be unprotected. Based on our results, a 23% expansion of the protected\u2010area network would be sufficient to protect the refugia present under all 3 climate projections we explored. We believe these refugia are high conservation priorities due to their potential to harbor rare species in the future. However, these locations are simultaneously highly vulnerable to climate change over the long term. These refugia contracted substantially between the 2050s and the 2080s, which supports the idea that the pace of climate change will strongly determine the availability and effectiveness of refugia for protecting today's biodiversity.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b8e9692e4b0702d0e7ebc1b", "parentId": "57daf654e4b090824ffc3290", "proj_id": "57daf24fe4b090824ffc3246", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5b8e9692e4b0702d0e7ebc1b"}, "5b8e9990e4b0702d0e7ebc27": {"title": "Springs as refugia in a changing climate?

Springs have been suggested as possible climate-change refugia, however, springs that depend on recent precipitation or snowmelt for recharge may be vulnerable to warming and drought intensification. Effective conservation of spring-dependent ecosystems\u2014and the biodiversity they support\u2014requires empirical approaches to assess resilience of springs to water cycle changes. Unfortunately, hydrologic data is unavailable for most springs, and those hydrologic records that do exist typically have inadequate temporal extent and resolution to adequately characterize resilience. To help fill these data gaps, remote sensing can be used to characterize seasonal and inter-annual changes in vegetation condition and moisture availability in spring-dependent ecosystems. In 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey initiated a study to employ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1985-2011 Landsat imagery to (1) develop methods to delineate surface-moisture zones (SMZs) in the vicinity of springs, and (2) characterize the relative resilience or vulnerability of SMZs to inter-annual changes in water availability. For 32 spring clusters in a sage-steppe landscape in southeastern Oregon, USA, 7 NDVI-based indicators of resilience were developed, synthesized, and examined in relation to topographic and hydrologic characteristics.  Results/Conclusions  Preliminary analysis shows that SMZs were generally located immediately downgradient of springs and/or along riparian areas of spring-fed streams. Seven NDVI-based indicators of SMZ resilience to inter-annual changes in water availability produced similar results in situating spring clusters along a resilience-vulnerability gradient: (1) mean, and (2) standard deviation of July NDVI; (3) mean difference in July NDVI and (4) difference in coefficient of variation for July NDVI between each SMZ and its surrounding watershed; (5) strength of the relationship between SMZ July NDVI and 90-day antecedent precipitation, (6) strength of the NDVI relationship with previous winter\u2019s snowpack, and (7) range of NDVI values from an exceptionally wet year followed by 4 dry years. Because all 7 resilience indicators were highly inter-correlated (all P &lt; 0.01), Principal Components Analysis was used to derive an overall metric of SMZ resilience, which accounted for 74% of total variance. This overall resilience metric was positively associated with mean SMZ elevation and mean slope, and was not associated with SMZ size or number of springs in each cluster.

This paper synthesizes understanding of the potential effects of changing climate and fire regimes on Pacific Northwest forests, including effects on disturbance and stress interactions, forest structure and composition, and post-fire ecological processes. We frame this information in a risk assessment context, and conclude with management implications and future research needs. Large and severe fires in the Pacific Northwest are associated with warm and dry conditions, and such conditions will likely occur with increasing frequency in a warming climate. According to projections based on historical records, current trends, and simulation modeling, protracted warmer and drier conditions will drive lower fuel moisture and longer fire seasons in the future, likely increasing the frequency and extent of fires compared to the twentieth century. Interactions between fire and other disturbances, such as drought and insect outbreaks, are likely to be the primary drivers of ecosystem change in a warming climate. Reburns are also likely to occur more frequently with warming and drought, with potential effects on tree regeneration and species composition. Hotter, drier sites may be particularly at risk for regeneration failures. Resource managers will likely be unable to affect the total area burned by fire, as this trend is driven strongly by climate. However, fuel treatments, when implemented in a spatially strategic manner, can help to decrease fire intensity and severity and improve forest resilience to fire, insects, and drought. Where fuel treatments are less effective (wetter, high-elevation, and coastal forests), managers may consider implementing fuel breaks around high-value resources. When and where post-fire planting is an option, planting different genetic stock than has been used in the past may increase seedling survival. Planting seedlings on cooler, wetter microsites may also help to increase survival. In the driest topographic locations, managers may need to consider where they will try to forestall change and where they will allow conversions to vegetation other than what is currently dominant.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e3d807ee4b0edb47be1ff38", "parentId": "5956a1fae4b0d1f9f050d920", "proj_id": "5956a1b5e4b0d1f9f050d917", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5e3d807ee4b0edb47be1ff38"}, "5e3d8a71e4b0edb47be26ded": {"title": "Fact Sheet - Changing Fire, Changing Forests: The Effects of Climate Change on Wildfire Patterns and Forests in the Pacific Northwest", "contacts": [{"name": "Jessica Halofsky", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "David Peterson", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Brian J.

Land elevation is the primary geophysical variable that determines exposure to inundation in coastal settings. Accordingly, coastal elevation data (with accuracy information) are critical for assessments of inundation exposure. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of using high-accuracy elevation data and rigorously accounting for uncertainty in inundation assessments. A quantitative analysis of inundation exposure was conducted for Majuro Atoll, including accounting for the cumulative vertical uncertainty from the input digital elevation model (DEM) and datum transformation. The project employed a recently produced and validated DEM derived from structure-from-motion processing of very-high-resolution aerial imagery. Areas subject to marine inundation (direct hydrologic connection to the ocean) and low-lying lands (disconnected hydrologically from the ocean) were mapped and characterized for three inundation levels using deterministic and probabilistic methods. At the highest water level modeled (3.75 ft, or 1.143 m), more than 34% of the atoll study area is likely to be exposed to inundation (68% chance or greater), while more than 20% of the atoll is extremely likely to be exposed (95% chance or greater). The study demonstrates the substantial value of a high-accuracy DEM for assessing inundation exposure of low-relief islands and the enhanced information from accounting for vertical uncertainty.

To quantify the impact of sea level rise on the tendency for flooding events to cluster in future years, we developed a hierarchical statistical model describing the number of days per year for which sea level exceeds a prescribed threshold in Honolulu as a function of annual mean sea level and the amplitude of the highest tides. Based on this model, we generate probabilistic projections of exceedance days per year for the 21st century, which show pronounced inflections in the frequency of exceedance days due to the interaction between sea level rise and long\u2010period (18.6 year) modulation of tidal amplitude.

The resulting higher insolation and evapotranspiration can exacerbate the effects of reduced rainfall. These altered meteorological conditions lead to less soil moisture. Depending on the persistence and severity of the conditions, drier soil can cause plant stress, affecting both agricultural and natural systems. Hydrological effects of drought include reductions in streamfow, groundwater recharge, and groundwater discharge to springs, streams, and near-shore environments.

We developed a set of fishing effort and habitat layers at high resolution and employed machine learning techniques to create regional\u2010scale seascape models and predictive maps of biomass and body length of targeted reef fishes for the main Hawaiian Islands. Spatial patterns of fishing effort were shown to be highly variable and seascape models indicated a low threshold beyond which targeted fish assemblages were severely impacted. Topographic complexity, exposure, depth, and wave power were identified as key habitat variables that influenced targeted fish distributions and defined productive habitats for reef fisheries. High targeted reef fish biomass and body length were found in areas not easily accessed by humans, while model predictions when fishing effort was set to zero showed these high values to be more widely dispersed among suitable habitats. By comparing current targeted fish distributions with those predicted when fishing effort was removed, areas with high recovery potential on each island were revealed, with average biomass recovery of 517% and mean body length increases of 59% on Oahu, the most heavily fished island.

Effective ridge-to-reef management requires improved understanding of land-sea linkages and decision-support tools to simultaneously evaluate the effects of terrestrial and marine drivers on coral reefs, mediated by anthropogenic activities. Although a few applications have linked the effects of land cover to coral reefs, these are too coarse in resolution to inform watershed-scale management for Pacific Islands. To address this gap, we developed a novel linked land-sea modeling framework based on local data, which coupled groundwater and coral reef models at fine spatial resolution, to determine the effects of terrestrial drivers (groundwater and nutrients), mediated by human activities (land cover/use), and marine drivers (waves, geography, and habitat) on coral reefs. We applied this framework in two \u2018ridge-to-reef\u2019 systems (H\u0101\u2018ena and Ka\u2018\u016bp\u016blehu) subject to different natural disturbance regimes, located in the Hawaiian Archipelago. Our results indicated that coral reefs in Ka\u2018\u016bp\u016blehu are coral-dominated with many grazers and scrapers due to low rainfall and wave power. While coral reefs in H\u0101\u2018ena are dominated by crustose coralline algae with many grazers and less scrapers due to high rainfall and wave power. In general, Ka\u2018\u016bp\u016blehu is more vulnerable to land-based nutrients and coral bleaching than H\u0101\u2018ena due to high coral cover and limited dilution and mixing from low rainfall and wave power. However, the shallow and wave sheltered back-reef areas of H\u0101\u2018ena, which support high coral cover and act as nursery habitat for fishes, are also vulnerable to land-based nutrients and coral bleaching. Anthropogenic sources of nutrients located upstream from these vulnerable areas are relevant locations for nutrient mitigation, such as cesspool upgrades. In this study, we located coral reefs vulnerable to land-based nutrients and linked them to priority areas to manage sources of human-derived nutrients, thereby demonstrating how this framework can inform place-based ridge-to-reef management.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5ada4ca1e4b0e2c2dd297a74", "parentId": "522e1f89e4b065b29d2812d9", "proj_id": "52165effe4b0b45d6ba393e8", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5ada4ca1e4b0e2c2dd297a74"}, "58a61dd1e4b025c464273561": {"title": "Project Snapshot: Valuing Climate Change Impacts on Coral Reef Ecosystem Services", "contacts": [{"name": "Kirsten Oleson", "type": "Principal Investigator", "email": "koleson@hawaii.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Pacific Islands CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2013", "summary": "This Project Snapshot provides an overview of the project \"Valuing Climate Change Impacts on Coral Reef Ecosystem Services\".", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58a61dd1e4b025c464273561", "parentId": "522e1f89e4b065b29d2812d9", "proj_id": "52165effe4b0b45d6ba393e8", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=58a61dd1e4b025c464273561"}, "58827216e4b0dc04318b78c3": {"title": "Final Project Report for \"Valuing Climate Change Impacts on Coral Reef Ecosystem Services\"", "contacts": [{"name": "Kirsten Oleson", "type": "Principal Investigator", "email": "koleson@hawaii.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Pacific Islands CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2013", "summary": "Coral reefs provide numerous ecosystem goods and services critical to human well-being (e.g., protection from storms and floods, food, income, recreation, and cultural practices), but those ecosystems are under serious threat due to growing human pressures, including overfishing, land-based pollution, and global climate change.

Use of such assessments has been limited due to a lack of clear guidance on the assessment process. This study builds on the latest scientific advances in RBM to provide that guidance from a resilience assessment undertaken in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We assessed spatial variation in ecological resilience potential at 78 forereef sites near the populated islands of the CNMI: Saipan, Tinian/Aguijan, and Rota. The assessments are based on measuring indicators of resilience processes and are combined with information on anthropogenic stress and larval connectivity. We find great spatial variation in relative resilience potential with many high resilience sites near Saipan (5 of 7) and low resilience sites near Rota (7 of 9). Criteria were developed to identify priority sites for six types of management actions (e.g., conservation, land-based sources of pollution reduction, and fishery management and enforcement) and 51 of the 78 sites met at least one of the sets of criteria. The connectivity simulations developed indicate that Tinian and Aguijan are each roughly 10 \u00d7 the larvae source that Rota is and twice as frequent a destination. These results may explain the lower relative resilience potential of Rota reefs and indicates that actions in Saipan and Tinian/Aguijan will be important to maintaining supply of larvae.

Along with increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and warming temperatures, rainfall, cloud cover, storm frequency, and other aspects of climate will also change. These shifts are likely to have effects on plants, such as changing the amount of water they use or how fast they grow. In this project, we investigated the connections between environmental conditions (such as temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, humidity, wind speed, soil moisture) and plant water use and growth rates of two forest ecosystems in Hawai\u2018i. Based on those connections, we sought to project how a specific set of possible future climate changes will affect water use and growth of these forests. The forests chosen for study represent relatively undisturbed native forest and a forest that has been invaded by the non-native tree strawberry guava. As a result of this study, we have found that more water is used at the non-native forest site, and growth characteristics of the two sites are different. Projections of changes that will be caused by future climate change show that both forests will use more water and will grow more slowly. It appears that both of these effects will be greater for the non-native site, i.e., the water use will increase more for the non-native forest and the growth will be reduced more there. Our findings are important because future increases in forest water use caused by climate change could reduce the availability of groundwater resources and streamflow.

Results show that the commonly used VWS measure between 200 and 850 hPa is less representative of the attenuating deep-layer shear effect than that between 300 and 1000 hPa. Moreover, the authors find that the low-level shear between 850 (or 700) and 1000 hPa is more negatively correlated with TC intensity change than any deep-layer shear during the active typhoon season, whereas deep-layer shear turns out to be more influential than low-level shear during the remaining less active seasons. Further analysis covering all seasons exhibits that a TC has a better chance to intensify than to decay when the deep-layer shear is lower than 7\u20139 m s \u22121 and the low-level shear is below 2.5 m s \u22121. The probability for TCs to intensify and undergo rapid intensification (RI) increases with decreasing VWS and increasing sea surface temperature (SST). TCs moving at slow translational speeds (less than 3 m s \u22121) intensify under relatively weaker VWS than TCs moving at intermediate translational speeds (3\u20138 m s \u22121).

The pseudo-global-warming method is employed, and the boundary conditions are based on a multimodel mean of projections made with global coupled models run with a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Results show that surface air temperature over land increases ~2\u00b0\u20134\u00b0C with the greatest warming at the highest topographic heights. A modest tendency for the warming to be larger on the leeward sides of the major islands is also apparent. Climatological rainfall is projected to change up to ~25% at many locations. The currently wet windward sides of the major islands will have more clouds and receive more rainfall, while the currently dry leeward sides will generally have even less clouds and rainfall. The average trade wind inversion\u2013base height and the mean marine boundary layer cloud heights are projected to exhibit only small changes. However, the frequency of days with clearly defined trade wind inversions is predicted to increase substantially (~83% to ~91%). The extreme rainfall events are projected to increase significantly. An analysis of the model\u2019s moisture budget in the lower troposphere shows that the increased mean rainfall on the windward sides of the islands is largely attributable to increased boundary layer moisture in the warmer climate.

Sources of erosion include unimproved roads, fallow and active agricultural fields, disturbed forests, local development, and streambanks. In this project, USGS used mapping, field experiments and monitoring, and analysis of recent (July 19\u201320, 2014) and historic rainfall to estimate sources of land-based pollution for watersheds in West Maui, Hawaii. USGS constructed an overall sediment budget for the watersheds, describing the proportion of sediment coming from each source. Findings indicate that streambank erosion of legacy fill terraces likely contributes most of the annual fine (&lt; sand) sediment to the nearshore. Terraces are the legacy of agricultural land management practices where soil and rock waste was pushed from the fields into stream channels. Surveys show these terraces occupy ~40% of the bank length along former agricultural land, and erode at median rates of 5-14 mm/year. A reconnaissance sediment budget for bank erosion of historic fill terraces indicates that just over 90 dumptruck loads of fine sediment are entering the nearshore environment each year from West Maui\u2019s watersheds. Annual sediment loads from this source may be up to 10-50 times the pre-human load, and 40-300% of annualized loads from large decadal storms. In short, a case can be made that the amounts of fine sediment arriving at the nearshore every year, from even small storms, are unprecedented.  We used findings from this field assessment to inform a decision-support model.

The results suggest that projected sea temperature increases will cause coral bleaching to occur annually in Guam and CNMI by the early 2040s, if current greenhouse gas emissions growth continues. Coral reefs are expected to change dramatically once severe bleaching occurs annually, resulting in loss of biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services. Reefs in Micronesia would have at least a decade more time to adapt or acclimate to climate change if the emissions reductions pledges made under the Paris Agreement become reality. Importantly, the projections reveal that coral reef futures, with respect to exposure to the temperatures that cause coral bleaching, vary greatly on local scales (10s of km). Therefore, the projections can be used to inform conservation and management planning, aiding managers in identifying and targeting actions to where they will most reduce vulnerability to climate change. The projections we developed include all coral reef areas and have been presented within a published scientific article, and the data and results have been made available via interactive tools online. The projections were summarized and presented to conservationists and natural resource managers in Guam and CNMI, raising awareness of what climate change will mean for ecosystem goods and services provision. Climate impact summaries we produced for Guam and CNMI were used as outreach and education tools and discussed with dozens of representatives of community groups, conservation and management agencies.

To reduce overfitting, recent work has used spatial basis functions such as polynomials, B splines, and principal components. Here, we explore an alternative to such basis functions by using regularization to reduce the dimension of the ST model space. In our regularized-ST method, traditional ST is an end member of a continuous spectrum of models. We use an evidence information criterion (EIC = \u22122 times the log of the prior predictive distribution) to select the optimal value of the regularization parameter, instead of the usual L-curve method, because the EIC can also be used to evaluate basis function models yet does not require counting model parameters. To test the method, we apply it to historical shoreline data from Kailua, Hawaii, comparing the results with those from B splines (basis functions) and traditional ST. As expected, the regularized-ST and B-spline models both give shoreline change rates that vary more smoothly alongshore than the rates from ST. The regularized-ST model, along with the B-spline model, also shows significantly better predictive capability over the traditional ST model from a fivefold cross-validation.

The resulting erosion hazard zones are overlain on aerial photos and other GIS layers to provide a tool for identifying assets exposed to future coastal erosion.

There are, currently, no practical methods for estimating the spatial extent of erosion hazard, despite the fact that increased sea level rise (SLR) over the current century is likely to contribute toward more land being exposed to future erosion. This study creates a new model which provides estimates of exposure to erosion on a local geographic scale. This new method is a valuable tool for the coastal community because of its ease of implementation and because it uses historical shoreline trends, information that is widely available.  This study applies the new model to all sandy shorelines of the Hawaiian Island of Kauai. Application to an entire island serves to: 1) ensure that the model can be successfully applied to diverse geologic and wave settings; and 2) provide erosion hazard projections for improved coastal management both for Kauai County and as part of the Hawaii legislatively-mandated Act 83, which requires the creation of the Interagency Climate Adaptation Committee (ICAC) tasked with creating a climate adaptation report on the impacts of SLR. Modeled erosion hazard areas are graphically presented in map form to identify areas that are vulnerable to erosion and which can be used to improve the decision-making process in coastal management. The probability of future exposure to erosion is shown as geographic information system (GIS) layers. These layers are incorporated into an online tool that displays erosion hazard layers, along with other SLR-related hazards.

Results for Kauai indicate that all four regions of the island (North, East, South, West) will have more areas experiencing coastal retreat, and the rates of retreat will become more intense over the current century.

Panel regression is used to overcome limitations of traditional regression methods, and obtain reliable model coefficients, in particular to understand the elasticity of streamflow to rainfall. Using annual rainfall and selected basin characteristics at 86 gaged streams in the Hawaiian Islands, regional regression models for three stream classes were developed to estimate the annual low-flow duration discharges. Three panel-regression structures (random effects, fixed effects, and pooled) were compared to traditional regression methods, in which space is substituted for time. Results indicated that panel regression generally was able to reproduce the temporal behavior of streamflow and reduce the standard errors of model coefficients compared to traditional regression, even for models in which the unobserved heterogeneity between streams is significant and the variance inflation factor for rainfall is much greater than 10. This is because both spatial and temporal variability were better characterized in panel regression. In a case study, regional rainfall elasticities estimated from panel regressions were applied to ungaged basins on Maui, using available rainfall projections to estimate plausible changes in surface-water availability and usable stream habitat for native species. The presented panel-regression framework is shown to offer benefits over existing traditional hydrologic regression methods for developing robust regional relations to investigate streamflow response in a changing climate.

Above that level, trees become scattered. Higher up, no trees are found. The level where the forest ends, called the forest line or timberline, is higher in tropical areas than in colder regions, suggesting that cold climate conditions prevent forests from growing at higher elevations. On tropical island mountains, such as those in the Hawaiian Islands, the forest line is found at a lower elevation than we would expect based on the temperature.  This leads us to suspect that some factor other than temperature, such as low rainfall, might be controlling the level of forest lines on these tropical islands. In this project, we sought to address this question by examining the characteristics of past droughts in a forest line study area on Haleakal\u0101, Maui as well as, how the vegetation responded to those droughts. We directly observed the microclimate and plant responses in the study area during a period when we expected an El Ni\u00f1o drought to occur.  In all droughts since 2000, except the one culminating in 2010, vegetation responded positively.

The objective of this project was to combine recent climate-modeling efforts for the state of Hawai\u2018i with existing models of plant-species distribution in order to forecast suitable habitat ranges under future climate conditions derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 3 (CMIP3) global circulation model that was dynamically downscaled for the Hawaiian Islands by using the Hawai\u2018i Regional Climate Model (HRCM). The HRCM uses the A1B emission scenario (a median future climate projection) from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). On the basis of this model, maps showing projected plant-species ranges were generated for four years as snapshots in time (2000, 2040, 2070, 2090) and for three different trajectories of climate change (gradual, linear, rapid) between the present and future.  We mapped probabilistic surfaces of suitable habitat for 39 plant species (both native and alien [nonnative]) identified as being of interest to HAVO resource managers. We displayed these surfaces in terms of change relative to present conditions, whether the range of a given plant species was expected to contract, expand, or remain the same in the future. Within HAVO, approximately two-thirds (18 of 29) of the modeled native plant species were projected to contract in range, whereas one-third (11 of 29) were projected to increase. Most of the HAVO SEAs were projected to lose most of the native plant species modeled. Within HAVO, all alien plant species except Lantana camara were projected to contract in range within the park; this trend was observed in most SEAs, including those at low, middle, and high elevations. Congruence was good in the \u201ccurrent\u201d (2000) distribution of plant-species richness and SEA configurations; however, the congruence between species-richness hotspots and SEAs diminished by the projected \u201cend-of-century\u201d (2090) distribution. Over time, the projected species-richness hotspots increasingly occurred outside of the currently configured SEA boundaries.

Our research assesses how global climate change will affect future malaria risk and native bird populations. We used an epidemiological model to evaluate future bird\u2013mosquito\u2013malaria dynamics in response to alternative climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Climate changes during the second half of the century accelerate malaria transmission and cause a dramatic decline in bird abundance. Different temperature and precipitation patterns produce divergent trajectories where native birds persist with low malaria infection under a warmer and dryer projection (RCP4.5), but suffer high malaria infection and severe reductions under hot and dry (RCP8.5) or warm and wet (A1B) futures. We conclude that future global climate change will cause significant decreases in the abundance and diversity of remaining Hawaiian bird communities.

Introduction of mosquitoes and vector-borne avian malaria are important factors in the historic decline and extinction of many endemic Hawaiian honeycreepers which are particularly susceptible to avian malaria. We used a model of forest birds, mosquitoes, and avian malaria to evaluate future impacts of avian malaria on these Hawaiian birds as a result of climate change. As climate warms during the 21st Century temperatures will favor increased mosquito populations and much higher transmission of malaria to endangered honeycreepers existing in high-elevation forests. We conclude that without significant intervention many native Hawaiian honeycreepers will suffer major population declines and/or extinction due to this increasing risk from avian malaria. Proposed strategies to mitigate the problem include mosquito population suppression using sterile males or incompatible males, release of mosquitoes which are genetically modified to prevent malaria transmission to birds (e.g., refractory mosquitoes), competition from other introduced mosquitoes, evolved malaria-tolerance in native honeycreepers, feral pig control to reduce mosquito larval habitats, and predator control to improve bird demographics. Because predicted transmission rates of malaria will be higher than currently observed, several conservation strategies including predator removal, competing vectors, and feral pig control were insufficient to maintain these important bird populations at current levels. In contrast, mosquito control strategies offer potential long-term benefits to high-elevation Hawaiian honeycreepers. The predicted higher rate of future disease transmission means that combined strategies will likely be needed to preserve endemic birds at mid elevation. The predicted climate changes are likely to have enormous impacts in high-elevation forests where current low rates of transmission create a refuge for highly-susceptible birds, mitigating malaria transmission should be a primary avian conservation goal.

Avian malaria is strongly influenced by climate; therefore, predicted future changes are expected to expand transmission into higher elevations and intensify and lengthen existing transmission periods at lower elevations, leading to further population declines and potential extinction of highly susceptible honeycreepers in mid- and high-elevation forests. Based on future climate changes and resulting malaria risk, we evaluated the viability of alternative conservation strategies to preserve endemic Hawaiian birds at mid and high elevations through the 21st century. We linked an epidemiological model with three alternative climatic projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project to predict future malaria risk and bird population dynamics for the coming century. Based on climate change predictions, proposed strategies included mosquito population suppression using modified males, release of genetically modified refractory mosquitoes, competition from other introduced mosquitoes that are not competent vectors, evolved malaria-tolerance in native honeycreepers, feral pig control to reduce mosquito larval habitats, and predator control to improve bird demographics.

Results show that the simulated frequency and intensity of TCs are very sensitive to the choice of the CP scheme. The sensitivity can be explained well by the difference in the low-level circulation in a height and sorted moisture space. By transporting moist static energy from dry to moist region, the low-level circulation is important to convective self-aggregation which is believed to be related to genesis of TC-like vortices (TCLVs) and TCs in idealized settings. The radiative and evaporative cooling associated with low-level clouds and shallow convection in dry regions is found to play a crucial role in driving the moisture-sorted low-level circulation. With shallow convection turned off in a CP scheme, relatively strong precipitation occurs frequently in dry regions. In this case, the diabatic cooling can still drive the low-level circulation but its strength is reduced and thus TCLV/TC genesis is suppressed. The inclusion of the cumulus momentum transport (CMT) in a CP scheme can considerably suppress genesis of TCLVs/TCs, while changes in the moisture-sorted low-level circulation and horizontal distribution of precipitation are trivial, indicating that the CMT modulates the TCLVs/TCs activities in the model by mechanisms other than the horizontal transport of moist static energy.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c18f6f9e4b006c4f857421e", "parentId": "50462d52e4b0241d49d62bea", "proj_id": "50118ddce4b0d78fd4e59ba3", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5c18f6f9e4b006c4f857421e"}, "595a877ae4b0d1f9f0528453": {"title": "Monitoring and projecting snow on Hawaii Island", "contacts": [{"name": "Chunxi Zhang", "type": "Author", "email": "chunxi@hawaii.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Kevin Hamilton", "type": "Author", "email": "kph@hawaii.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Yuqing  Wang", "type": "Author", "email": "yuqing@hawaii.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Pacific Islands CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "Abstract (from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016EF000478/full): The highest mountain peaks on Hawaii Island are snow covered for part of almost every year.

Future projections under the representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP45) and 8.5 (RCP85) scenarios are investigated.

Exceptions, such as the case of the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, can provide important insights into the complexity of biological responses to changing climate conditions. We present a time series of decadal population censuses, combined with a pair of early population projections, which together span the past 80 years of demographic history for this alpine plant.  Results The time series suggests a strong population recovery from the 1930s through the 1980s, likely owing at least in part to management actions taken on its behalf. In contrast, the population is estimated to have suffered a decline of approximately 60 % since the early 1990s. Fine-scale estimates of rainfall within silversword habitat are strongly correlated with these decadal-scale population changes over the past 50 years, with rainfall estimated to be substantially lower on average during the two most recent inter-census periods (after 1991). The reversal in the silversword population trajectory, and declines in rainfall in silversword habitat, coincide with an abrupt increase in the frequency of occurrence of the trade wind inversion (TWI) in Hawai\u02bbi around 1990.  Conclusions The shift in TWI incidence, which is linked to stronger subsidence in the Hadley circulation, has led to drier conditions in high elevation ecosystems in Hawai\u02bbi and appears to be eliciting ecological responses. Other regions influenced by the TWI could be similarly affected. The silversword case study reveals additional unexpected outcomes, such as the likely initial retraction from wetter, rather than drier, portions of the range in response to drying conditions. This pattern may stem in part from variation in drought tolerance across the range, highlighting the importance of detailed ecological and climatic information for making accurate predictions about climate change responses.

External threats such as invasive species and landscape characteristics such as isolation may impinge on both pollination and seed predation dynamics, which in turn can strongly affect reproduction. I assessed how patterns in floral visitation, seed predation, invasive ant presence, and plant isolation influenced one another and ultimately affected viable seed production in Haleakal\u0101 silverswords (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum) of Hawai\u2019i. Floral visitation was dominated by endemic Hylaeus bees, and patterns of visitation were influenced by floral display size and number of plants clustered together, but not by floral herbivory or nearest flowering neighbor distance. There was also some indication that Argentine ant presence impacted floral visitation, but contradictory evidence and limitations of the study design make this result uncertain. Degree of seed predation was associated only with plant isolation, with the two main herbivores partitioning resources such that one preferentially attacked isolated plants while the other attacked clumped plants; total seed predation was greater in more isolated plants. Net viable seed production was highly variable among individuals (0\u201355% seed set), and was affected mainly by nearest neighbor distance, apparently owing to low cross-pollination among plants separated by even short distances (&gt;10\u201320 m). This isolation effect dominated net seed set, with no apparent influence from floral visitation rates, percent seed predation, or invasive ant presence. The measured steep decline in seed set with isolation distance may not be typical of the entire silversword range, and may indicate that pollinators in addition to Hylaeus bees could be important for greater gene flow.

We conducted a detailed study of potential mechanisms underlying an elevational gradient in mortality that has characterized recent population declines of a threatened alpine plant, the Haleakal\u0101 silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum). We used a pair of greenhouse experiments staged at high and low elevations to test the influences of plasticity (to contrasting soil water availability and atmospheric conditions) and heredity (different seed source elevations) on the development of functional traits associated with drought resistance and on performance in a terminal drought. We then out\u2010planted a subset of plants into three common\u2010garden plots near the bottom, middle, and top of the silversword elevational range, and tracked growth and survival over 3.5 yr. A range of morphological traits (root and leaf mass fractions, specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, and root length per shoot mass) exhibited either heritable variation or plasticity or both. Among physiological traits measured, only water use efficiency exhibited a plastic treatment response. Survival of out\u2010plants was influenced during the first year by a home site advantage, and by the water treatment imposed in the greenhouses, with high water plants dying more often than low water plants. These effects subsequently dissipated, being replaced over the final 1.5 yr by a strengthening out\u2010plant site effect: survival was positively associated with site elevation, matching the pattern of mortality observed in the wild population. The balance of information suggests this pattern stems from lower elevation plants being less drought resistant than higher elevation plants, owing principally to plasticity, and thus suffering greater mortality during recent dry seasons. The pattern may be enhanced by stronger deviations from typical climatic conditions at lower elevations. Our findings suggest that future management should focus on climatically suitable habitat rather than advantageous genetic ecotypes.

The Haleakal\u0101 silversword is restricted to a single volcano summit in Hawai\u2018i, but is a highly charismatic giant rosette plant that is viewed by 1-2 million visitors annually. We link detailed local climate data to a lengthy demographic record, and combine both with a population-wide assessment of recent plant mortality and recruitment, to show that after decades of strong recovery following successful management, this iconic species has entered a period of substantial climate-associated decline. Mortality has been highest at the lower end of the distributional range, where most silverswords occur, and the strong association of annual population growth rates with patterns of precipitation suggests an increasing frequency of lethal water stress.

Mountain-top species are thought to be especially vulnerable because they have limited potential to make such shifts. The Haleakala silversword, also known as ahinahina, occurs near the top of Haleakala volcano on the island of Maui, Hawaii, and is an ideal species with which to investigate plant responses to changing climate conditions. Long-term monitoring data allowed us to determine that the population has undergone a decline of approximately 60% in recent decades, and that this has corresponded to drier conditions that have developed on the mountain. A population model constructed with these data led to predictions of a high risk of extinction, over the next century, for most of the population if recent demographic trends continue. The likelihood that these trends will continue depends in large part on future rainfall patterns on the mountain, which at this stage are uncertain. Given this uncertainty, it seems prudent to plan for warmer and drier climate scenarios. Our investigations into the factors that influence silversword seedling drought tolerance suggest that some genetic differences among sub-populations may exist, but that more variation arises from the conditions that seedlings experience during development. Differences in weather and climate conditions across the plant\u2019s range also appear to contribute to patterns of seedling survival after outplanting. These findings have led to subsequent work in collaboration with land managers at Haleakala National Park, in which survival rates will be monitored in outplanting plots across wider environmental gradients. These include wetter areas of the park where silverswords grew in the past, and where they may be better able to withstand warmer and drier conditions in the future.

In this work, a distance-weighted interpolation method used to map daily rainfall and temperature in Hawaii is described and assessed. New high-resolution (250 m) maps were developed for daily rainfall and daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) near-surface air temperature for the period 1990\u20132014. Maps were produced using climatologically aided interpolation, in which station anomalies were interpolated using an optimized inverse distance weighting approach and then combined with long-term means to produce daily gridded estimates. Leave-one-out cross validation was performed to assess the quality of the final daily grids. The median absolute prediction error for rainfall was 0.1 mm with an average overprediction (+0.6 mm) on days when total rainfall was less than 1 mm. On days with total rainfall greater than 1 mm, median absolute prediction errors were 2 mm and rainfall was typically underpredicted above the 10-mm threshold. For daily temperature, median absolute prediction errors were 3.1\u00b0 and 2.8\u00b0C for Tmax and Tmin, respectively.

National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data from wet season months (November to April) 1958\u20132010 are composited for heavy rain days at 12 rainfall stations in the Hawaiian Islands. The occurrence of heavy rain events (days with amounts above the 90th percentile estimated from all wet season rain days 1958\u20132010) was found to be strongly correlated with upper level cyclonic circulation anomalies centered northwest of Hawai\u2018i and south-to-north transport of water vapor in the middle troposphere. The statistical downscaling model (SD) developed in this study was able to reproduce the observed interannual variations in the number of heavy rain events based on cross-validation resampling during the more recent interval 1978\u20132010. However, multidecadal changes associated with the mid-1970s\u2019 climate shift were not well reproduced by the SD using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data, likely due to inhomogenities in the presatellite period of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. Application of the SD to two model scenarios from the CMIP3 database indicates a reduction of heavy rain events in the mid- to late 21st century. Based on these models, the likelihood of a widespread increase in synoptic heavy rain events in Hawai\u2018i as a result of anthropogenic climate change is low over the remainder of the century.

The spatial information content of our statistical downscaling method is improved over previous efforts through the inclusion of spatially extensive, high-quality monthly rainfall data set and the use of improved large-scale climate predictor information. Predictor variables include moisture transport in the middle atmosphere (700 hPa), vertical temperature gradients, and geopotential height fields of the 1000 and 500 hPa layers. The results allow for the first time to derive a spatially interpolated map with future rainfall change estimates for the main Hawaiian Islands. The statistical downscaling was applied to project wet (November\u2013April) and dry (May\u2013October) season rainfall anomalies for the middle and late 21st century. Overall, the statistical downscaling gives more reliable results for the wet season than for the dry season. The wet-season results indicate a pronounced dipole structure between windward facing mountain slopes and the leeward side of most of the islands. The climatically wet regions on the windward slopes of the mountain regions are expected to become wetter or remain stable in their seasonal precipitation amounts. On the climatically dry leeward sides of Kaua\u2018i, O\u2018ahu, Maui, and Hawai\u2018i Island, future precipitation exhibits the strongest drying trends. The projected future rainfall anomaly pattern is associated with a circulation anomaly that resembles a shift in the position or strength of the subtropical high and the average location of extratropical troughs.

As the global climate warms, it is important to understand observed rainfall variations to provide context for future changes. This is especially important for isolated oceanic islands where freshwater resources are limited, and understanding the potential impacts of climate change on the supply of freshwater is critical. Utilizing a high-resolution gridded data set of monthly and annual rainfall for Hawai\u2018i from January 1920 to December 2012, seasonal and annual trends were calculated for every 250-m pixel across the state and mapped to produce spatially continuous trend maps. To assess the stability of these trends, a running trend analysis was performed on 34 selected stations. From 1920 to 2012, over 90% of the state experienced drying trends, with Hawai\u2018i Island, and in particular the western part of the island, experiencing the largest significant long-term declines in annual and dry season rainfall. The running trend analysis highlighted the multi-decadal variability present in these trends, and revealed that the only region in the state with persistent annual and dry season trends through the study period is the western part of Hawai\u2018i Island; for most other regions, the drying trends were not significant until the most recent part of the record was included.

To estimate native and invasive species abundance in baseline climate conditions, a map was generated that considered abundance as percent cover and used high coefficient of variation values as a mask. The primary sources for post-processing the uncertainty masks are the Hawaiian Islands plant species abundance modeled means and standard deviation values (Wong et al., in preparation). These maps cover the entire landscape (including urban and agricultural areas), and therefore they can be applied in a variety of ways. Maps can be utilized to evaluate baseline climate conditions for each species and to forecast changes to community structure through expected shifts in species abundance. Maps can be combined in order to predict community dominance, for example, by identifying the most abundant native species at a given location. This can be applied to: 1) spatial and temporal assessments of habitat quality and community structure comparisons; 2) defining specific ecological restoration objectives; and 3) identifying potential for key invasive species to threaten a site (even where they are presently not found). Future projected abundances can enhance conservation planning both by anticipating where native species may increase or decrease in abundance and by identifying areas where invasive species may extend their range. Combining this with assessments of relative response rates can aid managers in prioritizing native species to promote and invasive species to preemptively control at a given site. Purpose: These data were compiled to provide context from other data products (e.g., correlative species abundance model maps, standard deviation value maps, habitat quality maps, and species relative response characteristics) such that areas with high uncertainty were identified and removed from species abundance model maps developed by Wong et al. (in preparation). These post-processed maps contribute to an initial set of supporting tools for managers and decision makers. However, given the inconsistency of their statistical performance between evaluation metrics, some of these exploratory abundance maps should be used with caution and with reference to high levels of uncertainty. As is the case with other macro-scale correlative models, they should be applied to management at a conceptual, landscape scale rather than for detailed management at local sites.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a", "parentId": "5046314fe4b0241d49d62c06", "proj_id": "501190e1e4b0d78fd4e59ba8", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=55bbdbade4b033ef52100e2a"}, "55f9ce0de4b05d6c4e501628": {"title": "Climate\u00a0Change\u00a0Atlas\u00a0\u2010\u00a0Dominant\u00a0vegetation\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Hawaiian\u00a0Islands", "contacts": [{"name": "USGS - Pacific Islands Climate Science Center", "type": "Data Owner", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "James D Jacobi", "type": "Co-Investigator", "email": "jjacobi@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Botanist (Research)", "orcId": "0000-0003-2313-7862"}, {"name": "USGS - Pacific Islands Climate Science Center", "type": "Data Owner", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "Taken from the DMP:    &quot;Georeferencing of plots and determination of site conditions using GIS.

Ten native and five invasive species of trees, shrubs and ferns were selected based on their potential ecological importance in communities, as well as how much field data was available to analyze for this study.    For baseline climate condition variables, we used surface temperature and rainfall estimates (30 year baseline period, 1978\u20132007) developed by Giambelluca et al. (2013) with grid cell resolution of 250m.

Plant species abundance models were developed using four baseline predictors with matching future projected climate variables: 1) simplified pioneer substrate (developed from geology maps by Price et al. (2012)) as a proxy for primary succession; 2) mean annual temperature (bio1); 3) wet season rainfall (bio18); and 4) dry season rainfall (bio19). Environmental variables were resampled to a consistent projection (WGS1984) with 250m grid cell resolution.    We examined data distribution and data gaps, and correlations between variables were assessed using a Pearson correlation coefficient. To estimate relative importance of predictors, we used species-specific response curves and variable importance plots. Individual model fit was assessed using residuals against fitted values plots, null and residual deviance values, and model comparisons using relative Akaike information criterion (AIC). We examined predictive performance of modeling approaches by first using 10 fold cross-validation then area under the curve (AUC) with an independent evaluation set.    Final models were built with a continuous second degree polynomial GLM model with second degree polynomial substrate variable removed, and no interactions. We used a 70/30 (train/test) random split using an evaluation data set that was independent of the training data, with 20 replicates. Multiple test statistics were used for validating model responses and a strong assessment of model performance.

Satellite imagery has become a cost-effective means for mapping near-shore bathymetry because ships cannot collect soundings safely while operating close to the shore. Also, green laser light detection and ranging (lidar) acquisitions are expensive in remote locations. Previous research has demonstrated that spectral band ratio-based techniques, commonly called the natural logarithm approach, may lead to more precise measurements and modeling of bathymetry because of the phenomenon that different substrates at the same depth have approximately equal ratio values. The goal of this research was to apply the band ratio technique to Landsat 8 at-sensor radiance imagery and WorldView-3 atmospherically corrected imagery in the coastal waters surrounding the Majuro Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands, to derive near-shore bathymetry that could be incorporated into a seamless topobathymetric digital elevation model of Majuro. Attenuation of light within the water column was characterized by measuring at-sensor radiance and reflectance at different depths and calculating an attenuation coefficient. Bathymetric lidar data, collected by the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office in 2006, were used to calibrate the SDB results. The bathymetric lidar yielded a strong linear relation with water depths. The Landsat 8-derived SDB estimates derived from the blue/green band ratio exhibited a water attenuation extinction depth of 6 meters with a coefficient of determination R2=0.9324. Estimates derived from the coastal/red band ratio had an R2=0.9597. At the same extinction depth, SDB estimates derived from WorldView-3 imagery exhibited an R2=0.9574. Because highly dynamic coastal shorelines can be affected by erosion, wetland loss, hurricanes, sea-level rise, urban development, and population growth, consistent bathymetric data are needed to better understand sensitive coastal land/water interfaces in areas subject to coastal disasters.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5af4885de4b0da30c1b44cfb", "parentId": "57aa2441e4b05e859be09124", "proj_id": "57aa1913e4b05e859be08faf", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5af4885de4b0da30c1b44cfb"}, "5a4e9527e4b0d05ee8c66423": {"title": "Project Snapshot: Collecting Elevation Data to Understand Climate Change Effects in the Marshall Islands", "contacts": [{"name": "Jeffrey J Danielson", "type": "Principal Investigator", "email": "daniels@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": "0000-0003-0907-034X"}, {"name": "Pacific Islands CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2016", "summary": "This Project Snapshot provides a brief overview summary of the project \"Collecting Elevation Data to Understand Climate Change Effects in the Marshall Islands\".", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a4e9527e4b0d05ee8c66423", "parentId": "57aa2441e4b05e859be09124", "proj_id": "57aa1913e4b05e859be08faf", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5a4e9527e4b0d05ee8c66423"}, "5a206c97e4b09fc93ddbaf06": {"title": "Final Report for Collecting Elevation Data to Understand Climate Change Effects in the Marshall Islands", "contacts": [{"name": "Jeffrey J Danielson", "type": "Principal Investigator", "email": "daniels@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": "0000-0003-0907-034X"}, {"name": "Pacific Islands CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2016", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a206c97e4b09fc93ddbaf06", "parentId": "57aa2441e4b05e859be09124", "proj_id": "57aa1913e4b05e859be08faf", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5a206c97e4b09fc93ddbaf06"}, "5b1b1e12e4b092d965252a9f": {"title": "Majuro UAV data", "contacts": [{"name": "Fletcher", "type": "Point of Contact", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Hawaii Coastal Geology Group", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "", "jobTitle": "Team Leader", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Chip Fletcher", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "", "jobTitle": "Team Leader", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2016", "summary": "The UAV imagery was collected by the Hawaii Coastal Geology Group of the University of Hawai'i, Manoa in August of 2017 for USGS.

Persistent drought is further affecting agricultural production and access to drinking water, and heat stress is increasingly common. The number of Marshallese people residing in the USA has increased rapidly from 6650 in 2000 to an estimated 30,000 in 2018. While we know that climate change is already affecting the Marshall Islands and that there are significant migration flows, we do not know to what extent people already migrate because of climate change. This paper addresses this gap and presents findings from interdisciplinary fieldwork in the Marshall Islands and destination areas in the USA. The research team conducted a survey (N\u2009=\u2009278), focus group discussions, expert interviews and a geo-spatial analysis of flood extent and migration rates to study the relationship between climatic events, ecosystem services and migration. The results show that respondents primarily cite education, health care, work and family visits as migration drivers, and only few mention climate impacts or environmental change. However, respondents do identify impacts of climate change on their livelihoods, health and safety, and the study finds significant correlations between climate impacts, trends in ecosystem services and migration propensities at household level. Furthermore, 62% of Marshallese respondents in the USA indicated that climate change affects their decision to return to Marshall Islands in the future.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e95e19f82ce172707f25316", "parentId": "576d745fe4b07657d1a37682", "proj_id": "575af95be4b04f417c275287", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5e95e19f82ce172707f25316"}, "5e46c054e4b0ff554f66538c": {"title": "Marshallese Migration: The Role of Climate Change and Ecosystem Services - Summary for Policymakers", "contacts": [{"name": "Kees van der Geest", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Maxine Burkett", "type": "Author", "email": "burkettm@hawaii.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Juno Fitzpatrick", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Mark Stege", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Brittany Lauren Wheeler", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Pacific Islands CASC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Pacific CASC", "fy": "2016", "summary": "This study aims to clarify the extent to which Marshallese people are already migrating because of climate change, and the role affected ecosystem services play in their migration decisions.

This research analyzes the relationship between two readily accessible drought indices\u2014the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index (PHDI)\u2014and the damage incurred by such droughts in terms of monetary loss, over the 1975\u20132010 time period on monthly basis, for five states in the south-central USA. Because drought damage in the Spatial Hazards Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUS\u2122) is reported at the county level, statistical downscaling techniques were used to estimate the county-level PDSI and PHDI. Correlation analysis using the downscaled indices suggests that although relatively few county\u2013months contain drought damage reports, drought indices can be useful predictors of drought damage at the monthly temporal scale extended to 12 months and at the county-level spatial scale. The varying time lags between occurrence of drought and reporting of damage, perhaps due to varying resilience to drought intensity and duration by crop types across space, along with differing irrigation schedules and adaptation measures of the community to drought over space and time, may contribute to weakened correlations.

While spatial downscaling of drought indicators from the climate divisional level to the county level has been conducted successfully in previous work, little research to date has attempted to \u201cupscale\u201d remotely sensed biophysical indicators to match the downscaled drought indices. This upscaling is important because drought damage and indices are often reported at a coarser scale than the biophysical indicators provide. This research upscales National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor-acquired Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data to produce a county-level biophysical drought index, for a five-state region of the South Central United States. The county-level NDVI is then correlated with the downscaled drought indices for assessing the degree to which the biophysical data match well-documented drought indicators. Results suggest that the Palmer Drought Severity Index and Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index are effective indicators of biophysical drought in much of the arid western part of the study area and in larger swaths of the study area in summer. In nearly all cases except for autumn months, correlations are weakest in the ecotones, with significant negative correlations in the humid eastern part of the study area.

Resilience assessment reveals distinct spatial variation in the levels of resilience to droughts across the region, with higher-resilience counties located mostly in Oklahoma, western Arkansas, and near large metropolitan areas. A total of 15 socioeconomic variables were found to be statistically associated with the level of resilience. Not surprisingly, these variables suggest that higher resilience is associated with higher socioeconomic condition. Results from the household surveys indicate that perception of drought and adoption of water conservation measures among residents and farmers is far from universal, and therefore, opportunities exist for more rigorous public education and community engagement.

Although several drought indices are available; which captures somewhat different aspects of drought conditions (Heim 2000), the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI; Palmer 1965) and Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI; Karl 1986) are commonly used, highly regarded, and readily available metrics. The PDSI, a weekly index of long-term moisture conditions, is produced by NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center and is calibrated to \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 conditions for its own subset of a state known as a climate division, with 0.0 representing average soil moisture conditions at that climate division for that time of year. Positive values represent above-normal moisture conditions for that location and negative values suggest below-normal soil moisture. Because the water balance calculations for PDSI include lags to take into account deep soil moisture conditions, PDSI is often considered in many applications a reasonable and versatile index of medium-term moisture. For evaluating longer-term hydrological conditions, the PHDI may prove more useful, because it's even longer-lagged response to changes in moisture conditions may better reflect the changes in groundwater availability and reservoir supplies that would be characteristic of drought impacts on communities\u2019 long-term water supply and demand (Guttman 1991). These two indices remain the most widely used and cited measures of drought. The versatility and availability of the PDSI and PHDI on a near-real-time basis make these two indices most desirable for use by environmental planners.

In this paper, we present projections of future fire probability for the southcentral USA using downscaled climate projections and the Physical Chemistry Fire Frequency Model (PC2FM). Future fire probability is projected to both increase and decrease across the study region of Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. Among all end-of-century projections, change in fire probabilities (CFPs) range from \u2212 51 to + 240%. Greatest absolute increases in fire probability are shown for areas within the range of approximately 75 to 160 cm mean annual precipitation (MAP), regardless of climate model. Although fire is likely to become more frequent across the southcentral USA, spatial patterns may remain similar unless significant increases in precipitation occur, whereby more extensive areas with increased fire probability are predicted. Perhaps one of the most important results is illumination of climate changes where fire probability response (+, \u2212) may deviate (i.e., tipping points). Fire regimes of southcentral US ecosystems occur in a geographic transition zone from reactant- to reaction-limited conditions, potentially making them uniquely responsive to different scenarios of temperature and precipitation changes.

The extreme drought of 2011 and the subsequent Flash Drought that occurred in summer, 2012, developed in part due to soil temperature dynamics across the landscape of the Southern High Plains. For both agroecosystems and natural landscapes within the South-Central Region, soil temperature has a major role in determining the success of annual cropping systems, the ability of perennial plants to either establish or maintain themselves and the ability of the soil bacteria and fungi to carry out important decomposition and nutrient cycling, which are crucial for ecosystem services. Not only does soil temperature dynamics influence plant growth and contribute to drought development, soil temperatures levels and the amount of variability in soil temperatures across a 24 hr period can also have a role in creating and promoting conditions that increase the capabilities of dried vegetation to maintain a fire. This project utilized the soil temperature data collected by the West Texas Mesonet (WTM) system for the period 2000 to 2014 to evaluate landscape level soil temperature dynamics across the Southern High Plains. For our analyses, we used thirty-three WTM locations that had continuous data from 2000 to 2014. We used several analytical approaches to look at how seasonal and yearly weather patterns influences soil temperatures and temperature variability across the landscape. From the Mesonet data we were able to generate three types of graphic representations of the soil temperature dynamics: 1) soil temperature profiles for a wet year (2004), an average year (2006) and a dry year (2011), three-dimensional representation soil temperature profiles from 12:00 AM through 11:59PM for the period 2000-2014 and daily temperature profiles for the period 2000-2014. Based upon these analyses two major determinants of soil temperature dynamics across the region were observed: 1) rainfall amounts and frequency was a major determinant of soil temperature patterns and amount of daily temperature variability observed, and 2) the responses of soils to precipitation/temperature interactions and subsequent seasonal patterns is highly dependent on soil type (amount of sand, silt and clay). Based upon these analyses how the landscape enters and subsequently responds to drought and contributes to drought is very location specific and is dependent upon soil type and vegetation cover. Moreover, how soils store heat and differ in their seasonal temperature dynamics at various locations on the SHP in response to yearly differences in weather contribute to the high variability in fire weather outcomes.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d600e6fe4b01d82ce9853f9", "parentId": "5318db43e4b0ae6e9d5a51cb", "proj_id": "529d13d7e4b00602d02de1cb", "purpose": "There have been numerous fire episodes during the past decade, yet ground-surface conditions that promote fire development are not well known.

Soil moisture, an important modulator of soil thermal regime, is expected to change as regional climate models predict rainfall patterns to increase in magnitude, but with longer intervals between rain events. The time is now to fine-tune the fire weather forecast predictions using soil temperature, soil moisture and weather conditions for a variety of managed and unmanaged systems in West Texas and Oklahoma. We plan to use long-term data (> 8 years) to provide us with a more solid understanding of drought development conditions (hence, fire weather risk, or additionally, for drought risk) under different scenarios of precipitation size and soil temperature.

Across this region, climate change is expected to cause more severe droughts, more intense heavy rainfall events, and subsequently more flooding episodes. These potential changes in climate will adversely affect habitats, ecosystems, and landscapes as well as the fish and wildlife they support. Better understanding and simulation of regional precipitation can help natural resource managers mitigate and adapt to these adverse impacts. In this project, we aim to achieve a better precipitation downscaling in the Great Plains with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model and use the high quality dynamic downscaling results (with a 4km horizontal resolution) to investigate the precipitation variability near the Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment in Texas, an area prone to heavy rain and devastating flood events. To this end, WRF simulations with different physics schemes and nudging strategies are first conducted for a representative warm season. Results show that simply choosing different physics schemes is not enough to alleviate the dry bias over the southern Great Plains, which is related to an anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the central and western parts of continental Page 2 of 54 U.S. in the simulations. Spectral nudging emerges as an effective solution for alleviating the precipitation bias. As a result, a better precipitation downscaling is achieved. With the carefully designed configurations, WRF downscaling is conducted for 1980-2015. The downscaling captures well the spatial distribution of monthly climatology precipitation and the monthly/yearly variability, showing improvement over at least two previously published precipitation downscaling studies. With the improved precipitation downscaling, a better hydrological simulation over the trans-state Oologah watershed is also achieved. In addition, analyzing the high-resolution (4 km) downscaling outputs leads to a better understanding regarding the precipitation variability in Texas.

The natural flow regime of most rivers has been perturbed by development during the 20th century and in some cases, before stream gaging began. The temporal resolution of natural flows estimated using traditional methods is typically not sufficient to evaluate cues that drive native ecosystem function. Additionally, these traditional methods are watershed specific and require large amounts of data to produce accurate results. We present a mass balance method that estimates natural flows at daily time step resolution for the northern branch of the Rio Grande, upstream from the Rio Conchos, that relies only on easily obtained streamflow data. Using an analytical change point method, we identified periods of the measured flow regime during the 20th century for comparison with the estimated natural flows. Our results highlight the significant deviation from natural conditions that occurred during the 20th century. The total annual flow of the northern branch is 95% lower than it would be in the absence of human use. The current 2 year flood has decreased by more than 60%, is shorter in duration, and peaks later in the year. When compared to unregulated flows estimated using traditional mass balance accounting methods, our approach provides similar results.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5adcb561e4b0e2c2dd2b74c4", "parentId": "5ca6355de4b0c3b0064c2585", "proj_id": "5ca62befe4b0c3b0064c24f1", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5adcb561e4b0e2c2dd2b74c4"}, "5ca638ace4b0c3b0064c25bd": {"title": "Final Report - Assessing the State of Ecosystem Knowledge of the Upper Rio Grande", "contacts": [], "casc": "South Central CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5ca638ace4b0c3b0064c25bd", "parentId": "5ca6355de4b0c3b0064c2585", "proj_id": "5ca62befe4b0c3b0064c24f1", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5ca638ace4b0c3b0064c25bd"}, "5c5b4e7ae4b070828902b5e0": {"title": "Standardized Soil Moisture Measurements from Sparse Networks in South Central United States from 2008 to 2017", "contacts": [{"name": "Steven M Quiring", "type": "Point of Contact", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Steven M.

A key indicator of drought severity is the amount of water stored in the soil, often referred to as soil moisture, yet soil moisture measurements are generally underused for drought monitoring.  This was once unavoidable because of a lack of soil moisture data, but the situation changed with the advent of large-scale monitoring networks that began in the 1990\u2019s.  Still, several key challenges limit the use of in situ soil moisture data for drought monitoring, and inhibit its translation into actionable information for producers and natural resource managers: (1) few studies have evaluated the potential role of existing large scale soil moisture networks for drought monitoring (2), there are no standards for measurement depths and sensing technologies, and (3) harmonized data are not readily available across monitoring networks.  Our study directly addressed these challenges through two specific aim 1.Develop readily understandable, scientifically sound, soil moisture-based drought indices for the South Central region. 2.Create a harmonized soil moisture dataset for the South Central region. Specific aim #1 was accomplished by evaluating and refining soil-moisture based indices using soil moisture data from the Oklahoma Mesonet and West Texas Mesonet. In separate studies, we identified the most promising indices based on relationships with wildfire and with crop yield.  Specific aim #2 was accomplished using data from the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor Testbed (MOISST).  Here we developed best practices to harmonize soil moisture data across soil depths and soil moisture monitoring networks.  This allowed us to merge soil moisture data from 2005-2017 gathered from networks across the South Central region [Oklahoma Mesonet, West Texas Mesonet, NOAA Climate Reference Network (CRN), and NRCS Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN)] into a publicly available, regional, soil moisture product to support drought monitoring and future climate and drought research.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c5b3982e4b070828902b232", "parentId": "551ed2dde4b027f0aee3b9b9", "proj_id": "551ebff1e4b027f0aee3b93f", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5c5b3982e4b070828902b232"}, "5d094ca8e4b0e3d3115dbf51": {"title": "Development and Evaluation of Soil Moisture-Based Indices for Agricultural Drought Monitoring", "contacts": [{"name": "Erik Krueger", "type": "Author", "email": "erik.krueger@okstate.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Tyson Ochsner", "type": "Author", "email": "tyson.ochsner@okstate.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Steven Quiring", "type": "Author", "email": "squiring@geog.tamu.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "South Central CASC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "South Central CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "Abstract (from Science Direct): Agricultural drought is characterized by low soil moisture levels that negatively affect agricultural production, but in situ soil moisture measurements are largely absent from indices commonly used to describe agricultural drought.

Our objective was to use in situ soil moisture data from monitoring networks in Oklahoma and West Texas to identify a soil moisture-based agricultural drought index that is (i) strongly related to crop-yield anomaly across networks, (ii) comparable across time and space, and (iii) readily understandable. Candidate indices included soil matric potential (MP), soil water storage (SWS), and fraction of available water capacity (FAW), with indices assessed in their raw form and after climatological (i.e., anomalies) or statistical standardization. At the county level, indices related similarly to crop-yield anomaly, with soil moisture-yield anomaly correlation coefficients averaging 0.63, 0.76, and 0.76 for winter wheat, hay, and cotton, respectively. However, standardization was essential to maximize temporal and spatial comparability, and at the regional level, standardized indices were more highly correlated with crop-yield anomaly than non-standardized indices. Our findings show that existing in situ soil moisture datasets can underpin regional drought-monitoring systems.

However, the relative merits of measured soil moisture and KBDI as indicators of wildfire danger are unknown. Therefore, our objectives were to (i) identify relationships between drought indices (KBDI or fraction of available water capacity, FAW) and wildfire size for 34,939 growing and dormant-season wildfires, (ii) compare relationships between each drought index and wildfire probability for 501 large (\u2265 405 ha) growing-season and dormant-season wildfires, and (iii) quantify relationships between KBDI and FAW for each season in Oklahoma, the United States. Neither KBDI nor FAW accurately represented dormant-season wildfire danger, with wildfires \u2265 121 ha occurring across nearly the entire range of each index. During the growing season, however, we found that a smaller percentage of wildfires \u2265 121 ha occurred under extreme levels of KBDI than under equivalent levels of FAW (66% vs. 81%), and a logistic regression model based on FAW correctly classified more growing-season days with large wildfires than the KBDI model (84% vs. 79%). Furthermore, while FAW represented soil moisture in near real-time, KBDI responded slower to soil drying and recharge, so FAW provided about 10 d earlier warning of extreme wildfire potential for the 10 largest growing-season wildfires in our study. We therefore recommend replacing KBDI with FAW in growing-season wildfire danger assessments in Oklahoma and regions with similar climate (temperate, subhumid to semiarid) and vegetation types (primarily herbaceous).", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59bacaede4b091459a563cf2", "parentId": "551ed2dde4b027f0aee3b9b9", "proj_id": "551ebff1e4b027f0aee3b93f", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=59bacaede4b091459a563cf2"}, "58a35741e4b0c82512869c44": {"title": "Observed and CMIP5 modeled influence of large-scale circulation on summer precipitation and drought in the South-Central United States", "contacts": [{"name": "Springer Berlin Heidelberg", "type": "Publisher", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Jung-Hee Ryu", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Katharine Hayhoe", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "South Central CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "South Central CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "Abstract (from http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-017-3534-z): Annual precipitation in the largely agricultural South-Central United States is characterized by a primary wet season in May and June, a mid-summer dry period in July and August, and a second precipitation peak in September and October. Of the 22 CMIP5 global climate models with sufficient output available, 16 are able to reproduce this bimodal distribution (we refer to these as \u201cBM\u201d models), while 6 have trouble simulating the mid-summer dry period, instead producing an extended wet season (\u201cEW\u201d models). In BM models, the timing and amplitude of the mid-summer westward extension of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) are realistic, while the magnitude of the Great Plains Lower Level Jet (GPLLJ) tends to be overestimated, particularly in July. In EW models, temporal variations and geophysical locations of the NASH and GPLLJ appear reasonable compared to reanalysis but their magnitudes are too weak to suppress mid-summer precipitation. During warm-season droughts, however, both groups of models reproduce the observed tendency towards a stronger NASH that remains over the region through September, and an intensification and northward extension of the GPLLJ. Similarly, future simulations from both model groups under a\u2009+1 to +3\u2009\u00b0C transient increase in global mean temperature show decreases in summer precipitation concurrent with an enhanced NASH and an intensified GPLLJ, though models differ regarding the months in which these decreases are projected to occur: early summer in the BM models, and late summer in the EW models.

All share a critical need for water, which is becoming an increasingly scarce resource across the region as aquifers are overdrawn and populations grow. Understanding what brings rain to this region, and how the timing and amount of precipitation may be affected by climate change, is essential for effective water planning and management. However, currently available information on long-term precipitation trends for the South Central region is often perceived to be irrelevant to community planners and water managers, due to multiple factors including mismatches between the time horizons used in planning versus projections, high levels of uncertainty associated with precipitation projections for the region, and the challenges of presenting scientific information in accessible ways. This project tackled the question of whether it is possible to increase the relevance of long-term precipitation projections to real-world decision-makers in the South Central region. To that end, we expanded our understanding of the natural atmospheric processes that bring moisture to the region and were able to determine that global climate models are able to reproduce the large-scale atmospheric patterns that control the onset and duration of growing-season drought; and that these patterns are likely to become stronger and longer-lasting in the future. We also developed surveys that we distributed to water managers in Texas and Louisiana. The questionnaire included sample data, figures, and maps, and asked participants in-depth questions regarding the time horizons, specific climate indicators, and methods of presentation they found to be most relevant and useful to their work. Finally, we used this information to develop future projections for individual weather stations and a regular grid covering the South Central region, and to summarize these projections using the indicators and methods of presentation prioritized by survey respondents.

Urban barriers can constrain migration and result in wetland loss (coastal squeeze). For future-focused conservation planning purposes, there is a pressing need to quantify and compare the potential for wetland landward movement and coastal squeeze. For 41 estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico (i.e., the USA gulf coast), we quantified and compared the area available for the landward migration of tidal saline wetlands and the area where urban development is expected to prevent migration (coastal squeeze), under three alternative future sea-level rise scenarios (0.5-, 1.0-, and 1.5-m by 2100).", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5989fd82e4b09fa1cb0cc903", "parentId": "580a8f88e4b0f497e7906ca3", "proj_id": "580a8e71e4b0f497e7906c7a", "purpose": "This effort builds on work by Enwright and others (2015, 2016) which modeled future tidal saline wetland landward migration at the region scale (i.e., all five Gulf coast states).

Detailed information on the extent and distribution of emergent marsh vegetation types throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico coast has been historically unavailable. In response, the U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Ducks Unlimited, Inc., and the Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, produced a classification of emergent marsh vegetation types from Corpus Christi Bay, Texas, to Perdido Bay, Alabama.  This study incorporates about 9,800 ground reference locations collected via helicopter surveys in coastal wetland areas. Decision-tree analyses were used to classify emergent marsh vegetation types by using ground reference data from helicopter vegetation surveys and independent variables such as multitemporal satellite-based multispectral imagery from 2009 to 2011, bare-earth digital elevation models based on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), alternative contemporary land cover classifications, and other spatially explicit variables. Image objects were created from 2010 National Agriculture Imagery Program color-infrared aerial photography. The final classification is a 10-meter raster dataset that was produced by using a majority filter to classify image objects according to the marsh vegetation type covering the majority of each image object.

In response, the U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Ducks Unlimited, Inc., and the Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, produced a classification of emergent marsh vegetation types from Corpus Christi Bay, Texas, to Perdido Bay, Alabama.  This study incorporates about 9,800 ground reference locations collected via helicopter surveys in coastal wetland areas. Decision-tree analyses were used to classify emergent marsh vegetation types by using ground reference data from helicopter vegetation surveys and independent variables such as multitemporal satellite-based multispectral imagery from 2009 to 2011, bare-earth digital elevation models based on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), alternative contemporary land cover classifications, and other spatially explicit variables. Image objects were created from 2010 National Agriculture Imagery Program color-infrared aerial photography. The final classification is a 10-meter raster dataset that was produced by using a majority filter to classify image objects according to the marsh vegetation type covering the majority of each image object.

Connectivity can be defined as the extent to which the landscape facilitates or impedes the movement of organisms among patches of habitat. The goal of this project was to evaluate terrestrial connectivity across the South Central United States. We addressed this goal using a variety of approaches, including evaluating connectivity of major habitats (grasslands and forests), predicting future changes in landscape connectivity for grassland species under future land-use change scenarios, assessing terrestrial vertebrate diversity in relation to habitat loss and fragmentation, and analyzing the combined effects of climate and habitat fragmentation on the distributions of grassland-obligate bird species. We found that connectivity has declined for species with low to moderate dispersal abilities, and that pattern is expected to continue under future scenarios of land-use change. For grassland birds, the contribution of climate, landscape variables, and their combined effects varied among species, but their combined effects can exceed the independent effects of the two drivers for some species. Thus, the importance of connectivity is expected to increase with the negative implications of climate change for wildlife populations and communities. These results can be used to inform management decisions and identify future research needs related to terrestrial connectivity within this region.

In monoculture, milfoil growth was reduced at high salinity (20) versus low salinity (0), while biomass allocation differed significantly with greater allocation to shoots under high light, compared to low light. Widgeongrass was minimally affected by salinity, with reduced stem densities at high salinity compared to low salinity. In mixture, both species under-yielded compared to monoculture with milfoil reduced with high salinity and light, and low salinity and light; widgeongrass under-yielded with low salinity and high light, and mid salinity (10) and low light. These differences in species\u2019 responses suggest that salinity and light contribute to the distribution of milfoil and widgeongrass, with higher salinities and light favoring widgeongrass growth, and lower light possibly decreasing both species\u2019 growth, and ultimately, distribution. With continued changes occurring and predicted from both coastal restoration and climate change, understanding drivers of habitat forming species remains critical to inform future landscapes.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d31f434e4b01d82ce86ea5b", "parentId": "578cee4fe4b0c1aacabb4af7", "proj_id": "5012df8ce4b05140039e03c7", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5d31f434e4b01d82ce86ea5b"}, "5887c0e1e4b02e34393da413": {"title": "Submerged aquatic vegetation and environmental data along a salinity gradient in Barataria Bay, Louisiana (2015)", "contacts": [{"name": "U.S. Geological Survey", "type": "Point of Contact", "email": "mlapeyre@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Eva Hillmann", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Kristin DeMarco", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Megan La Peyre", "type": "Originator", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Megan La Peyre", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "mlapeyre@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "U.S. Geological Survey ScienceBase", "type": "Distributor", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Land Resources", "type": "USGS Mission Area", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Climate Adaptation Science Centers", "type": "SDC Data Owner", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "South Central CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "This data set includes bi-monthly data on submerged aquatic vegetation species composition, percent cover, above and below ground biomass and environmental data at coastal sites across the fresh to saline gradient in Barataria Bay, LA.

When fish detection error that is due to highly variable instream environments needs to be addressed, sand\u2010bed streams of the Great Plains represent a unique challenge. We quantified seining detection probability for diminutive Great Plains fishes across a range of sampling conditions in two sand\u2010bed rivers in Oklahoma. Imperfect detection resulted in underestimates of species occurrence using na\u00efve estimates, particularly for less common fishes. Seining detection probability also varied among fishes and across sampling conditions. We observed a quadratic relationship between water depth and detection probability, in which the exact nature of the relationship was species\u2010specific and dependent on water clarity. Similarly, the direction of the relationship between water clarity and detection probability was species\u2010specific and dependent on differences in water depth. The relationship between water temperature and detection probability was also species dependent, where both the magnitude and direction of the relationship varied among fishes. We showed how ignoring detection error confounded an underlying relationship between species occurrence and water depth. Despite imperfect and heterogeneous detection, our results support that determining species absence can be accomplished with two to six spatially replicated seine hauls per 200\u2010m reach under average sampling conditions; however, required effort would be higher under certain conditions. Detection probability was low for the Arkansas River Shiner Notropis girardi, which is federally listed as threatened, and more than 10 seine hauls per 200\u2010m reach would be required to assess presence across sampling conditions.

The use of convection-permitting resolutions avoids cumulus parameterization, which is known to be a large source of uncertainty. A regional climate model (RCM) based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model is configured with a 4\u2009km grid spacing and applied to the U.S. Great Plains, a region characterized by many forms of weather and climate extremes. The 4\u2009km RCM is evaluated by running it in a hindcast mode over the central U.S. region for a 10\u2009year period, forced at the boundary by the 32\u2009km North America Regional Reanalysis. The model is also run at a 25\u2009km grid spacing, but with cumulus parameterization turned on for comparison. The 4\u2009km run more successfully reproduces certain observed features of the Great Plains May-through-August precipitation. In particular, the magnitude of extreme precipitation and the diurnal cycle of precipitation over the Great Plains are better simulated. The 4\u2009km run more realistically simulates the low-level jet and related atmospheric circulations that transport and redistribute moisture from Gulf of Mexico. The convection-permitting RCM may therefore produce better dynamical downscaling of future climate when nested within global model climate projections, especially for extreme precipitation magnitudes. The 4\u2009km and 25\u2009km simulations do share similar precipitation biases, including low biases over the central Great Plains and high biases over the Rockies.

In many semi-arid environments, woody plants face both fire and drought as recurring disturbances. Past work has demonstrated that oaks inhabiting sky-island forests of the northern Sierra Madre Oriental have differing microhabitat preferences and heavy stem dieback occured during the historic 2011 drought indicating potential xylem failure. These oak species, representing two sections within the genus, are all post-fire resprouters: they can resprout from underground storage organs when fire kills above ground tissue. Resprouts provide an opportunity to examine how functional traits may change as plastic responses to changing environmental conditions. Post-fire resprouts have increased root:shoot ratios relative to adults and therefore have access to more water relative to leaf demand. We expected that if resprouts exhibit plasticity in xylem function, they should favor water transport efficiency over safety: they should have higher maximum xylem conductivity, but greater susceptibility to drought-induced cavitation. We examined four oak species common in the Davis Mountains in west Texas and compared adult physiology with that of resprouts following wildfire. We found that species differed in degree of desiccation avoidance (isohydry) consistent with microhabitat preferences and that the species that were most desiccation tolerant as adults had resprouts significantly more susceptible to xylem cavitation.

It is likely that this region will face a hotter climate in the future. A particular concern is that many of these tree species (oaks, pines, and junipers) are restricted to higher elevations and that a warming climate will reduce the available habitat causing populations to decline. Although all trees are restricted to mountains in this region, different species prefer different local habitats (for example, one might prefer south slopes, others valley bottoms). This suggests that more than simply elevation determines tree habitat. We took detailed measurements of temperature and soil moisture across three mountain ranges in West Texas, identified key topographical factors driving such microclimate variation, and modeled future fine scale climate as a function of topography across multiple future scenarios. We combined these climate data with measurement of plant traits related to drought tolerance to predict where suitable habitat for important southwestern trees might occur under future climates. We found that local topography had strong effects on air temperature and soil moisture such that the cooler, wetter locations were not always at the highest elevations. In fact, these ranges showed strong nighttime cold air drainage patterns: locally low elevations were often dramatically cooler than the highest elevations. This result suggests that these mountain ranges may continue to offer suitable habitat for some species even under a warming climate.

Analysis techniques, such as cross-validation, allow assessments of how well ESD methods meet these goals during observational periods. However, the extent to which an ESD method\u2019s skill might differ when applied to future climate projections cannot be assessed readily in the same manner. Here we present a \u201cperfect model\u201d experimental design that quantifies aspects of ESD method performance for both historical and late 21st century time periods. The experimental design tests a key stationarity assumption inherent to ESD methods \u2013 namely, that ESD performance when applied to future projections is similar to that during the observational training period. Case study results employing a single ESD method (an Asynchronous Regional Regression Model variant) and climate variable (daily maximum temperature) demonstrate that violations of the stationarity assumption can vary geographically, seasonally, and with the amount of projected climate change. For the ESD method tested, the greatest challenges in downscaling daily maximum temperature projections are revealed to occur along coasts, in summer, and under conditions of greater projected warming.

Using as input the output from large-scale dynamical climate models and observation-based data products, SD aims to provide a finer grain of detail and to mitigate systematic biases.

However, one of the key assumptions of SD is that the relationships used to train the method during a historical period are unchanged in the future, in the face of climate change. The validity of this assumption is typically quite difficult to assess in the normal course of analysis, as observations of future climate are lacking. We approach this problem using a \u201cperfect model\u201d experimental design in which high-resolution dynamical climate model output is used as a surrogate for both past and future observations.  We find that while SD in general adds considerable value, in certain well-defined circumstances it can produce highly erroneous results.

These issues are compounded by precipitation structures that are relatively shallow and experience growth at low levels due to orographic enhancement. To improve surface precipitation estimation, researchers at the University of Oklahoma have demonstrated the benefits of integrating the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) products into the ground-based NEXRAD rainfall estimation system using a vertical profile of reflectivity (VPR) identification and enhancement (VPR-IE) approach. However, the temporal resolution of TRMM limits the application of VPR-IE method operationally. To implement the VPR-IE concept into the National Mosaic and Multi-Sensor QPE (NMQ) system in real time, climatological VPRs from 11 years of TRMM PR observations have been characterized for different stratiform/convective rain types, seasons, and surface rain intensities. Then, these representative profiles are used to adjust ground radar\u2013based precipitation estimates in the NMQ system based on different precipitation structures. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the newly developed climatological VPR-IE (CVPR-IE) method on winter events (January, February, and December) in 2011.

Model simulations were conducted at 35 nested gauging stations. Compared with simulated results using a priori parameters, single-site calibration can improve VIC model performance at specific calibration sites; however, improvement is still limited in upstream locations. The newly developed MSCC approach overcomes this limitation. Simulations using MSCC not only utilize all of the available streamflow observations but also better represent spatial heterogeneities in the model parameters.

Scientists, water managers and other stakeholders are interested in knowing what is in store for the future of the Red River Basin. Researchers at the University of Oklahoma and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations developed projections of future hydrology for the Red River Basin under possible future climate conditions. A methodology was developed for using current state of the art Global Climate Models (GCM) and applying them on a scale suitable for hydrologic models, ultimately making the information useful to water managers and interested stakeholders. We conclude that there are considerable differences between the various models generated and that many other sources of uncertainty exist when using that information for water management decisions. However, the following general conclusions can be made: (1) Precipitation: Most models predict slightly less precipitation in the western portions of the basin and more in the east in the future. This is particularly true for the MPI-ESM-LR GCM, however it is not the case for all simulations and making a generalized statement about future precipitation would be inadvisable. Increased evaporation somewhat negates this effect when analyzing future flows; (2) Temperature: It will be warmer in the future, with the magnitude of the temperature increase largely dictated by the amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere in the future. In fact, under the worst case scenarios, average temperatures could increase by as much as 6 o C (11 o F). Daily minimum temperatures are expected to increase more than daily maximum; (3) Hydrology: While some of the models predict similar or more streamflow in the future, especially in the eastern portions of the Red River Basin, this is not a universal conclusion. In fact some of the models under higher emission scenarios predict significantly less flow in the western reaches in the future. There is a strong possibility that future droughts will be longer and deeper across the entire basin, while floods may be more intense.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5704ff6ae4b0d4e2b7567b18", "parentId": "5225474ae4b0e4746d62b02f", "proj_id": "521cf67ce4b01458f7858040", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5704ff6ae4b0d4e2b7567b18"}, "53bea4a0e4b0527d5d4117e0": {"title": "Performance assessment of the successive Version 6 and Version 7 TMPA products over the climate-transitional zone in the southern Great Plains, USA", "contacts": [{"name": "Lei Qiao", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Yang Hong", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Sheng Chen", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Chris B.

Two basins, the Verdigris River Basin (VRB) in the east and the Upper Washita Basin (UWB) in the west, with distinctive precipitation but similar vegetation and elevation, were selected to evaluate the TMPA products using rain gauge-blended products with WSR-88D NEXRAD Stage IV. This study sheds important insights into the detailed spatiotemporal precipitation errors, and also reveals algorithm performance during extreme events over the two low-relief basins within a high precipitation gradient zone. Based on nine years of measurements (2002 - 2010), this study shows that: (1) 3B42V7 corrects the widespread rainfall underestimation from research product 3B42V6, especially for the drier UWB with relative bias (RB) improvement from - 23.24% to 2.24%. (2) 3B42RTV7 reduces the widespread, notable overestimation from the real-time product 3B42RTV6, with minor overestimation in the wet VRB and underestimation in the dry UWB. (3) For both versions of TMPA products, larger root mean square error (RMSE) but higher correlation coefficients (CCs) tend to appear for the wet VRB, while lower RMSE and CC mostly occur in the dry UWB. 3B42RTV7 shows a drawback that the CC declines significantly, especially in the dry region where it drops below 0.5. (4) Seasonally, autumn rainfall estimations in both versions and basins have the least bias. The 3B42RTV6 overestimation and 3B42V6 underestimation of spring and summer rainfall, which dominate the annual total bias, are significantly reduced for both basins in the V7 products. Winter precipitation estimation improvement is also noticeable with significant RB and RMSE reductions. However, considerable overestimation in summer rainfall still exists for the wet basin. (5) Although V7 has the overall best performance, it still shows deficiency in detecting extreme rainfall events in low-relief regions, tending to underestimate peak rainfall intensity and to misrepresent timing and locations.

Here we produced a long-term (1982\u20132013) remote sensing based land ET record and investigated multidecadal changes in global ET and underlying causes. The ET record shows a significant upward global trend of 0.88 mm yr\u22122 (  P &lt; 0.001) over the 32-year period, mainly driven by vegetation greening (0.018% per year;   P &lt; 0.001) and rising atmosphere moisture demand (0.75 mm yr\u22122;   P = 0.016). Our results indicate that reduced ET growth between 1998 and 2008 was an episodic phenomenon, with subsequent recovery of the ET growth rate after 2008. Terrestrial precipitation also shows a positive trend of 0.66 mm yr\u22122 (  P = 0.08) over the same period consistent with expected water cycle intensification, but this trend is lower than coincident increases in evaporative demand and ET, implying a possibility of cumulative water supply constraint to ET.

Hydrologic models can be used to provide estimates of streamflow in the absence of streamflow information. These models depend upon available streamflow data for calibration, and can be very inaccurate without the use of those data. This research developed a method to group watersheds that are gaged with watersheds that are not gaged so that accurate estimates of water availability can be provided regionally. To accomplish this, various models, techniques, and data were used to group watersheds across the southeastern United States. This means that watersheds were not necessarily grouped by proximity to one another, but instead were grouped based on their response to climate and their landscape setting.

The portal was then constructed on top of the WFS to take user-specified data request (such as geographic location, period of record, and variable of interest), retrieve the specified data from the Hydrology Futures database, and generate graphs and summary reports back to the user.

In coastal wetlands of eastern and central North America, freeze\u2010sensitive woody plants (mangroves) are expected to expand northward into regions currently dominated by freeze\u2010tolerant herbaceous salt marsh plants. To advance understanding of mangrove range expansion, there is a need to refine temperature thresholds for mangrove freeze damage, mortality, and recovery.  We integrated data from 38 sites spread across the mangrove range edge in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of North America, including data from a regional collaborative network \u2014 the Mangrove Migration Network. In 2018, an extreme freeze event affected 60% of these sites, with minimum temperatures ranging from 0 to \u20107\u00b0C.  We used temperature and vegetation data from before and after the freeze to quantify temperature thresholds for leaf damage, mortality, and biomass recovery of the black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) \u2014 the most freeze\u2010tolerant mangrove species in North America.  For A. germinans individuals near their northern range limit, our results indicate that temperature thresholds for leaf damage are close to \u20104\u00b0C, but temperature thresholds for mortality are closer to \u20107\u00b0C. Thresholds are expected to be warmer for more southern A. germinans individuals and for the other two common mangrove species in the region (Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle). Regenerative buds allowed A. germinans to resprout and recover quickly from aboveground freeze damage. Hence, biomass recovery levels during the first post\u2010freeze growing season were 90, 78, 62, and 45% for temperatures of \u20104, \u20105, \u20106, and \u20107\u00b0C, respectively. Due to a combination of vigorous resprouting and new recruitment from propagules, we expect full recovery at most sites within 1\u20103 years, assuming no further freeze events.  Synthesis  To improve predictions of tropical range expansion in response to climate change, there is a need to better understand tropical species\u2019 responses to winter temperature extremes. Collectively, our results refine temperature thresholds for A. germinans freeze damage, mortality, and recovery, which can improve predictions of mangrove range expansion and coastal wetland ecological transformations in a warming climate.

Projections of climate, urbanization, vegetation, and surface-depression storage capacity were used as inputs to the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System to simulate projected impacts on hydrologic response. Surface runoff substantially increased when land cover change was applied. However, once the surface depression storage was added to mitigate the land cover change and increases of surface runoff (due to urbanization), the groundwater flow component then increased. For hydrologic studies that include projections of land cover change (urbanization in particular), any analysis of runoff beyond the change in total runoff should include effects of stormwater management practices as these features affect flow timing and magnitude and may be useful in mitigating land cover change impacts on streamflow. Potential changes in water availability and how biota may respond to changes in flow regime in response to climate and land cover change may prove challenging for managers attempting to balance the needs of future development and the environment. However, these models are still useful for assessing the relative impacts of climate and land cover change and for evaluating tradeoffs when managing to mitigate different stressors.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/562f81ede4b093cee780a2ea", "parentId": "54c68a19e4b043905e019ae4", "proj_id": "54c2c14fe4b043905e01854e", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=562f81ede4b093cee780a2ea"}, "54f4a4cde4b02419550d0065": {"title": "Users manual for Stream Temp Model - SNTEMP", "contacts": [{"name": "Steven L Markstrom", "type": "Author", "email": "markstro@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Hydrologist", "orcId": "0000-0001-7630-9547"}, {"name": "Southeast CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Southeast CASC", "fy": "2011", "summary": "A software program, called P2S, has been developed which couples the daily stream temperature simulation capabilities of the U.S. Geological Survey Stream Network Temperature model with the watershed hydrology simulation capabilities of the U.S. Geological Survey Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System.

Systematic measurements of calcification over space and time are necessary to detect change resulting from environmental stressors. We established a network of calcification monitoring stations at four managed reefs along the outer Florida Keys Reef Tract (FKRT) from Miami to the Dry Tortugas. Eighty colonies (in two sequential sets of 40) of the reef-building coral,  Siderastrea siderea, were transplanted to fixed apparatus that allowed repetitive detachment for buoyant weighing every 6 months. Algal-recruitment tiles were also deployed during each weighing interval to measure net calcification of the crustose coralline algal (CCA) community. Coral-calcification rates were an order of magnitude greater than those of CCA. Rates of coral calcification were seasonal (summer calcification was 53 % greater than winter), and corals in the Dry Tortugas calcified 48 % faster than those at the other three sites. Linear extension rates were also highest in the Dry Tortugas, whereas percent area of the coral skeletons excavated by bioeroding fauna was lowest. The spatial patterns in net coral calcification revealed here correlate well with Holocene reef thickness along the FKRT and, in part, support the \u201cinimical waters hypothesis\u201d proposed by Ginsburg, Hudson, and Shinn almost 50 yrs ago to explain reef development in this region. Due to the homogeneity in coral-calcification rates among the three main Keys sites, we recommend refinement of this hypothesis and suggest that water-quality variables (e.g., carbonate mineral saturation state, dissolved and particulate organic matter, light attenuation) be monitored alongside calcification in future studies.

On the basis of such studies, ecological forecasting models predict that, in the absence of dispersal and resource barriers, many species will exhibit large shifts in abundance and geographic range in response to warming. However, species are composed of individual populations, which may be subject to different selection pressures and therefore may be differentially responsive to environmental change. Asystematic responses across populations and species to warming will alter ecological communities differently across space. Common garden experiments can provide a more mechanistic understanding of the causes of compositional and spatial variation in responses to warming. Such experiments are useful for determining if geographically separated populations and co-occurring species respond differently to warming, and they provide the opportunity to compare effects of warming on fitness (survivorship and reproduction). We exposed colonies of two common ant species in the eastern United States,   Aphaenogaster rudis and   Temnothorax curvispinosus, collected along a latitudinal gradient from Massachusetts to North Carolina, to growth chamber treatments that simulated current and projected temperatures in central Massachusetts and central North Carolina within the next century. Regardless of source location, colonies of   A. rudis, a keystone seed disperser, experienced high mortality and low brood production in the warmest temperature treatment. Colonies of  T. curvispinosus from cooler locations experienced increased mortality in the warmest rearing temperatures, but colonies from the warmest locales did not.

Three primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain why multiple herbivorous arthropods are more abundant and damaging in cities, and support has been found for each. First, less complex vegetation may reduce biological control of pests. Second, plant stress can increase plant quality for pests. And third, urban warming can directly increase pest fitness and abundance. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and the effects of temperature and plant stress are particularly related. Thus, we test the hypothesis that urban warming and drought stress combine to increase the fitness and abundance of the scale insect, Melanaspis tenebricosa, an urban tree pest that is more abundant in urban than rural areas of the southeastern U.S. We did this by manipulating drought stress across an existing mosaic of urban warming. We found support for the additive effect of temperature and drought stress such that female embryo production and body size increased with temperature and was greater on drought-stressed than watered trees. This study provides further evidence that drivers of pest insect outbreaks act in concert, rather than independently, and calls for more research that manipulates multiple abiotic factors related to urbanization and climate change to predict their effects on ecological interactions.

We examine a 38-year shift (1974\u20132012) in an elevation ecotone between two closely related ant species,  Aphaenogaster picea and  A. rudis. Even though  A. picea and  A. rudis are closely related with North American distributions that sometimes overlap, they also exhibit local- and regional-scale differences in temperature requirements so that  A. rudis is more southerly and inhabits lower elevations whereas  A. picea is more northerly and inhabits high elevations. We find considerable movement by the warm-habitat species upward in elevation between 1974 and 2012 with  A. rudis, replacing the cold-habitat species,  A. picea, along the southern edge of the Appalachian Mountain chain in north Georgia, USA. Concomitant with the distribution shifts, regional mean and maximum temperatures remain steady (1974\u20132012), but minimum temperatures increase. We collect individuals from the study sites and subject them to thermal tolerance testing in a controlled setting and find that maximum and minimum temperature acclimatization occurs along the elevation gradient in both species, but  A. rudis consistently becomes physiologically incapacitated at minimum and maximum temperatures 2 &deg;C higher than  A. picea. These results indicate that rising minimum temperatures allow  A. rudis to move upward in elevation and displace  A. picea.

We investigated the degree to which changes in the abundance of ants under warming reflect reductions in the thermal niche space for their foraging. In an eastern deciduous forest system in the United States with approximately 40 ant species, we found that for some species, the loss of thermal niche space for foraging was related to decreases in abundance with increasing experimental climatic warming. However, many ant species exhibited no loss of thermal niche space. For one well-studied species,  Temnothorax curvispinosus, we examined both survival of workers and growth of colonies (a correlate of reproductive output) as functions of temperature in the laboratory, and found that the range of thermal tolerances for colony growth was much narrower than for survival of workers. We evaluated these functions in the context of experimental climatic warming and found that the difference in the responses of these two attributes to temperature generates differences in the means and especially the variances of expected fitness under warming. The expected mean growth of colonies was optimized at intermediate levels of warming (2\u20134&deg;C above ambient); yet, the expected variance monotonically increased with warming. In contrast, the expected mean and variance of the survival of workers decreased when warming exceeded 4&deg;C above ambient. Together, these results for  T. curvispinosus emphasize the importance of measuring reproduction (colony growth) in the context of climatic change: indeed, our examination of the loss of thermal niche space with the larger species pool could be missing much of the warming impact due to these analyses being based on survival rather than reproduction.

Using microsatellite markers, we characterized colony breeding structure and levels of inbreeding in populations over large parts of the range of the subterranean termites  Reticulitermes flavipes in the USA and  R. grassei in Europe.

Inbreeding in  R. flavipes was most strongly associated with climatic variables (mean annual temperature and seasonality), whereas nonclimatic variables, including the availability of wood substrate and soil composition, were important predictors of inbreeding in R. grassei.

When plants experience more herbivory in these situations it is called associational susceptibility and is most common when herbivores spill from their preferred plant host onto neighboring plants. Cankerworms are common pests of urban trees that have been shown in forests to disperse from preferred to less preferred hosts. I found that two common characteristics of urban habitats, low vegetational diversity and exotic plants, affect cankerworm herbivory of non-host understory plants. In an urban landscape I measured cankerworm herbivory on native dogwood trees growing in the open and below cankerworm host and non-host trees. Herbivory of native dogwoods was ten times greater below cankerworm hosts than on trees below non-hosts or in the open. At an arboretum I measured herbivory of native and exotic plants growing below cankerworm hosts in simple landscape plantings and in natural forests. Associational susceptibility of native dogwoods and Rhododendron spp. disappeared when they were growing in complex natural forests even though cankerworm hosts were more abundant. Cankerworms consistently preferred native plant species more than exotic congeners in laboratory experiments. As such, exotic plants experienced very little herbivory regardless of habitat. Herbivorous pests are often more abundant on urban plants than plants in natural habitats. My research shows that, although some plants experience more herbivory when growing near cankerworm hosts, increasing urban habitat complexity could reduce pest damage overall.

We found that tropical ants have lower warming tolerances, a metric of susceptibility to climate warming, than temperate ants despite greater increases in temperature at higher latitudes. Using climatic, ecological and phylogenetic data, we refine our predictions of which ants (across all regions) were most susceptible to climate warming. We found that ants occupying warmer and more mesic forested habitats at lower elevations are the most physiologically susceptible to deleterious effects of climate warming. Phylogenetic history was also a strong indicator of physiological susceptibility.

We used urban warming as a proxy for global warming in as much as many cities have already warmed as much, due to heat island effects, as they are expected to warm due to climate change by 2050 or even 2100.

The SPB has a considerable effect on forest dynamics in the Southeastern United States, especially in loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda) stands that are managed for timber production. Regional outbreaks of SPB occur in bursts resulting in elimination of entire stands and major economic loss. These outbreaks are often interspersed with decades of inactivity, making long-term modeling of SPB dynamics challenging. Forest management techniques, including thinning, have proven effective and are often recommended as a way to prevent SPB attack, yet the robustness of current management practices to long-term SPB dynamics has not been examined. We used data from previously documented SPB infestations and forest inventory data to model four scenarios of SPB dynamics and pine forest management. We incorporated two levels of beetle pressure: a background low level, and a higher level in which SPB had the potential to spread among pine stands. For each level of beetle pressure, we modeled two scenarios of forest management: one assuming forests would be managed continuously via thinning, and one with a reduction in thinning. For our study area in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama, we found that beetle pressure and forest management both influenced the landscape effects of SPB. Under increased SPB pressure, even with continuous management, the area of pine forests affected across the region was six times greater than under baseline SPB levels. However, under high SPB pressure, continuous management decreased the area affected by nearly half compared with reduced management. By incorporating a range of forest and SPB dynamics over long time scales, our results extend previous modeling studies, and inform forest managers and policy-makers about the potential future effects of SPB. Our model can also be used to investigate the effects of additional scenarios on SPB dynamics, such as alternative management or climate change.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/54dd1793e4b08de9379b2f8b", "parentId": "54c689cee4b043905e019ad5", "proj_id": "54c2c128e4b043905e01854b", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=54dd1793e4b08de9379b2f8b"}, "54dd1194e4b08de9379b2f30": {"title": "Modeling climate change, urbanization, and fire effects on Pinus palustris ecosystems of the southeastern U.S.", "contacts": [{"name": "Jennifer K.

In fire-dependent ecosystems, predicting this response requires a focus on how these drivers will impact fire regimes. Here, we use scenarios of climate change, urbanization and management to simulate the future dynamics of the critically endangered and fire-dependent longleaf pine ( Pinus palustris) ecosystem. We investigated how climate change and urbanization will affect the ecosystem, and whether the two conservation goals of a 135% increase in total longleaf area and a doubling of fire-maintained open-canopy habitat can be achieved in the face of these drivers. Our results show that while climatic warming had little effect on the wildfire regime, and thus on longleaf pine dynamics, urban growth led to an 8% reduction in annual wildfire area.

Urban sprawl strongly impacts the urban ecosystems it creates and the natural and agro-ecosystems that it displaces and fragments. Here, we project urban sprawl changes for the next 50 years for the fast-growing Southeast U.S. Previous studies have focused on modeling population density, but the urban extent is arguably as important as population density per se in terms of its ecological and conservation impacts. We develop simulations using the SLEUTH urban growth model that complement population-driven models but focus on spatial pattern and extent. To better capture the reach of low-density suburban development, we extend the capabilities of SLEUTH by incorporating street-network information. Our simulations point to a future in which the extent of urbanization in the Southeast is projected to increase by 101% to 192%.

A BN is used to define relationships between driving forces, geologic constraints, and coastal response for the U.S. Atlantic coast that include observations of local rates of relative sea level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal slope, and shoreline change rate. The BN is used to make probabilistic predictions of shoreline retreat in response to different future sea level rise rates.

Where more specific information is included, the probability of shoreline change increases in a number of cases, indicating more confident predictions. A hindcast evaluation of the BN indicates that the network correctly predicts 71% of the cases. Evaluation of the results using Brier skill and log likelihood ratio scores indicates that the network provides shoreline change predictions that are better than the prior probability.

We illustrate this approach using a 482 km2 catchment in the southeastern US supporting 50 or more stream fish species. A spatially distributed, deterministic and physically based hydrologic model is used to simulate daily streamflow for sub-basins composing the catchment. We use geographic data to characterize stream segments with respect to channel size, confinement, position and connectedness within the stream network. Simulated streamflow dynamics are then applied to model fish metapopulation dynamics in stream segments, using hypothesized effects of streamflow magnitude and variability on population processes, conditioned by channel characteristics. The resulting time series simulate spatially explicit, annual changes in species occurrences or assemblage metrics (e.g. species richness) across the catchment as outcomes of management scenarios. Sensitivity analyses using alternative, plausible links between streamflow components and metapopulation processes, or allowing for alternative modes of fish dispersal, demonstrate large effects of ecological uncertainty on model outcomes and highlight needed research and monitoring.

To appraise the efficacy of this approach, we evaluated relative support for hypothesized effects of seasonal streamflow components, stream channel characteristics, and fish species traits on local extinction, colonization, and recruitment (meta-demographic rates) of stream fishes. We used 4 years of seasonal fish collection data from 23 streams to fit multistate, multiseason occupancy models for 42 fish species in the lower Flint River Basin, Georgia.

Small-bodied species with generalized life-history characteristics were more resilient to flow variability than large-bodied species with specialized life-history characteristics.

There exists several possible formulations of the reserve design problem, depending on the objectives and the constraints. In this article, we considered the dynamic problem of designing a reserve that contains a desired area of several key habitats. The dynamic case implies that the reserve cannot be designed in one time step, due to budget constraints, and that habitats can be lost before they are reserved, due for example to climate change or human development. We proposed two heuristics strategies that can be used to select sites to reserve each year for large reserve design problem. The first heuristic is a combination of the Marxan and site-ordering algorithms and the second heuristic is an augmented version of the common naive myopic heuristic.

To buffer against global change, an established adaptation strategy is designing protected areas to increase representation and complementarity of biodiversity features. Uncertainty regarding the scale and magnitude of landscape change complicates reserve planning and exposes decision makers to risk of failing to meet conservation goals. Conservation planning tends to treat risk as an absolute measure, ignoring the context of the management problem and risk preferences of stakeholders. Application to conservation of risk management theory emphasizes diversification of portfolio of assets, with the goal of reducing the impact of system volatility on investment return. We use principles of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which quantifies risk as the variance and correlation among assets, to formalize diversification as an explicit strategy for managing risk in climate\u2010driven reserve design. We extend MPT to specify a framework that evaluates multiple conservation objectives, allows decision makers to balance management benefits and risk when preferences are contested or unknown, and includes additional decision options such as parcel divestment when evaluating candidate reserve designs. We apply an efficient search algorithm that optimizes portfolio design for large conservation problems and a game theoretic approach to evaluate portfolio tradeoffs that satisfy decision makers with divergent benefit and risk tolerances, or when a single decision maker cannot resolve their own preferences. Evaluating several risk profiles for a case study in South Carolina, our results suggest that a reserve design may be somewhat robust to differences in risk attitude but that budgets will likely be important determinants of conservation planning strategies, particularly when divestment is considered a viable alternative. We identify a possible fiscal threshold where adequate resources allow protecting a sufficiently diverse portfolio of habitats such that the risk of failing to achieve conservation objectives is considerably lower.

We show that our approach (implementable with commercial solvers such as CPLEX) can effectively solve the proposed BQCQP for much larger problems than previous approaches published in the ecological literature. Optimal solutions for problems with less than 400 parcels can be computed within a minute. Near optimal solutions (within at most 0.2% gap from an optimal solution) for high-dimensional problems involving up to 800 parcels can be computed within 8 h on a standard computer. We have presented a new approach to solve SCP optimization problems while considering uncertainty and risk tolerance of decision makers.

Climate warming is expected to increase arthropod damage in forests, in part, by transforming innocuous herbivores into severe pests: awakening sleeper species. Urban areas are warmer than natural areas due to the urban heat island effect and so the trees and pests in cities already experience temperatures predicted to occur in 50\u2013100 years. We posit that arthropod species that become pests of urban trees are those that benefit from warming and thus should be monitored as potential sleeper species in forests. We illustrate this with two case studies of scale insects that are important pests of urban trees in parts of the US. Melanaspis tenebricosa and Parthenolecanium quercifex are geographically native to the US but take on invasive characteristics such as higher survival and reproduction and become disconnected from natural enemies on urban trees due to the urban heat island effect. This allows them to reach high densities and damage their host trees. Parthenolecanium quercifex density increases up to 12 times on urban willow oaks with just 2 \u00b0C of warming due to higher survival and adaptation to warmer temperatures. The urban heat island effect also creates a phenological mismatch between P. quercifex and its parasitoid complex, and so egg production is higher. Melanaspis tenebricosa density can increase 300 times on urban red maples with 2.5 \u00b0C of warming. This too is due to direct effects of warmer temperatures on survival and fecundity but M. tenebricosa also benefits from the drought stress incurred by warmer urban trees. These effects combine to increase M. tenebricosa density in forests as well as on urban trees at latitudes higher than its native range. We illustrate how cities provide a unique opportunity to study the complex effects of warming on insect herbivores.

We used plasticine caterpillar models to assess risk of predation by birds and insects, collected leaf-feeding arthropods, and measured herbivory in willow oak trees (Quercus phellos) in two seasons to determine how predation influenced herbivory across urban forest fragments, street trees planted near forest fragments, and downtown street trees. Predation attempts by birds and abundance of chewing folivores were greater on trees growing in urban forest fragments than downtown street trees. Bird predation attempts and herbivory levels were inconsistent for near-forest trees. Predation attempts by arthropods did not statistically vary among the three urban tree habitats. Contrary to expectations based on theory, chewing folivore abundance and herbivory were generally highest on trees growing in urban forests, the most complex habitat we studied, and the habitat where risk of bird predation was greatest. We suggest that urban forest fragments provide better habitat than other urban landscapes for both urban birds and chewing folivores by having greater habitat complexity.

In some cities, like those at cooler latitudes, trees may benefit from warmer urban temperatures, but trees in many cities are beset with problems like drought stress and increased herbivory. What drives patterns of urban tree health across urbanization and latitudinal temperature gradients? In natural systems, latitude\u2013herbivory relationships are well\u2010studied, and recent temperate studies have shown that herbivory generally increases with decreasing latitudes (warmer temperatures). However, the applicability of this latitude\u2013herbivory theory in already\u2010warmed urban systems is unknown. In this study, we investigated how the interaction of urbanization, latitudinal warming and scale insect abundance affected urban tree health. We predicted that trees in warmer, lower latitude cities would be in poorer health at lower levels of urbanization than trees at cooler, higher latitudes due to the interaction of urbanization, latitudinal temperature and herbivory. To evaluate our predictions, we surveyed the abundance of scale insect herbivores on a single, common tree species Acer rubrum in eight US cities spanning 10\u00b0 of latitude. We estimated urbanization at two extents, a local one that accounted for the direct effects on an individual tree, and a larger one that captured the surrounding urban landscape. We found that urban tree health did not vary with latitudinal temperature but was best predicted by local urbanization and herbivore abundance. We did not observe increased herbivore abundance in warmer, lower latitudes cities, but instead herbivore abundance peaked in the mid latitudes of our study.

However, exotic plants may be less palatable to many native insects and reduce herbivore biomass that may fuel higher trophic levels. Furthermore, a loss of herbivores in exotic ornamental landscapes may reduce top-down control by natural enemies. In this study, we compare herbivory in native and exotic congener ornamental landscapes. We also explore if caterpillar abundance, natural enemy abundance, diversity, community composition, spider biomass, and egg predation differ between the two landscape types. We predicted that herbivory, as well as natural enemy abundance and predation would be greater in native landscapes. Although we found that leaf area lost to herbivory was greater in native plots in one of the collection years, this relationship was weak. Natural enemy diversity differed between landscape types, but depended on plant genus. The relationship between plant origin and natural enemy diversity was also weak. Caterpillar abundance, natural enemy community composition, spider biomass, and predation services did not differ between treatments. Overall, our results suggest that ornamental landscapes planted in native plants may not differ from landscapes planted in exotic congeners in the pest management and conservation services they provide, particularly with regard to invertebrate natural enemies.

Organisms living in cities are exposed to variable levels of chronic environmental stress. However, whether chronic stress ameliorates or exacerbates the negative effects of hurricanes remains an open question. Here, we consider two hypotheses about the simultaneous consequences of acute disturbances from hurricanes and chronic stress from urbanization for the structure of urban arthropod communities. The tipping point hypothesis posits that organisms living in high stress habitats are less resilient than those in low stress habitats because they are living near the limits of their environmental tolerances; while the disturbance tolerance hypothesis posits that high stress habitats host organisms pre-adapted for coping with disturbance, making them more resilient to the effects of storms. We used a before-aftercontrol- impact design in the street medians and city parks of Manhattan (New York City, New York, USA) to compare arthropod communities before and after Super Storm Sandy in sites that were flooded and unflooded during the storm. Our evidence supported the disturbance tolerance hypothesis. Significant compositional differences between street medians and city parks before the storm disappeared after the storm; similarly, unflooded city parks had significantly different arthropod composition while flooded sites were indistinguishable. These differences were driven by reduced occurrences and abundances of arthropods in city parks. Finally, those arthropod groups that were most tolerant to urban stress were also the most tolerant to flooding. Our results suggest that the species that survive in high stress environments are likely to be the ones that thrive in response to acute disturbance. As storms become increasingly common and extreme, this juxtaposition in responses to storm-associated disturbance may lead to diversity loss in cities, potentially leading entire urban landscapes to mirror the reduced diversity of street medians.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a8c7158e4b00f54eb45fe9f", "parentId": "55fb1b80e4b05d6c4e501c10", "proj_id": "55fb1b38e4b05d6c4e501c08", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5a8c7158e4b00f54eb45fe9f"}, "5c82a06de4b0938824489503": {"title": "Exotic urban trees conserve similar natural enemy communities to native congeners but have fewer pests", "contacts": [{"name": "Steven Frank", "type": "Author", "email": "sdfrank@ncsu.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Kristi M.

For example, in 2012 neither predator nor parasitoid abundance differed among native and exotic Acer congeners but in 2016 a native species, A. saccharum, had the least of both groups. A native, Q. phellos, had significantly more predators and parasitoids in 2012 than its native and exotic congeners but no differences in 2016.

However, the effects of urbanization, particularly high temperatures, can benefit chronic insect pests and threaten ecosystem services offered by urban trees. Urban forest fragments are an often-overlooked component of the greater urban forest which may help to mitigate the damaging effects of urbanization. Melanaspis tenebricosa (gloomy scale) is a common pest of Acer rubrum(red maple) that becomes more abundant because of the urban heat island effect. We conducted observational and manipulative field experiments to test the hypothesis that trees in urban forest fragments would be cooler than those in surrounding ornamental landscapes and would thus have fewer M. tenebricosa, particularly in a hot mid-latitude city. Trees in forest fragments were 1.3\u00b0 cooler and had three orders of magnitude fewer M. tenebricosa than trees in ornamental landscapes in Raleigh, NC USA. However, there was no difference in M. tenebricosa density between forest and landscape trees in Newark, DE and Philadelphia, PA USA which are 3.95 degrees of latitude higher, and nearer to the northern range extent. Trees in landscapes and forest fragments did not differ in predawn water potential, a measure of water stress, but likely differed in soil composition and moisture. We used potted trees to control for these differences and found that M. tenebricosadensity still increased three times more in landscapes than forests suggesting temperature and not tree stress is the dominant factor. Taken together our results indicate two things. First, that trees growing in urban forest fragments are buffered from a chronic urban tree pest due to lower temperatures. Second, that temperature-driven differences in M. tenebricosa density which we saw in Raleigh could predict future density of the pest in higher latitude cities as the climate warms.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5c925451e4b093882456be43", "parentId": "55fb1b80e4b05d6c4e501c10", "proj_id": "55fb1b38e4b05d6c4e501c08", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5c925451e4b093882456be43"}, "59cbd8c9e4b017cf314245c4": {"title": "Temperature observations from portable data loggers and remote environmental weather stations in North Carolina (2015)", "contacts": [{"name": "Adam Terando", "type": "Author", "email": "aterando@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Elsa K.

This report provides an overview of a pilot effort to integrate vulnerability (exposure and sensitivity), significance, and use potential metrics in a decision framework\u2014the Optimal Preservation (OptiPres) Model\u2014to inform climate adaptation planning of a subset of buildings in historic districts (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) at Cape Lookout National Seashore.

The outputs from the different budget scenarios, though not prescriptive, provide visualizations of and insights to the sequence and type of optimal actions and the changes to individual building resource values and accumulated resource values. Study findings suggest the OptiPres Model has planning utility related to fiscal efficiency by identifying a budget threshold necessary to maintain the historical significance and use potential of historical buildings while reducing vulnerability (collectively, the accumulated resource value). Specifically, findings identify that a minimum of the industry standard ($222,000 annually for the 17 buildings) is needed to maintain the current accumulated resource value. Additionally, results suggest that additional appropriations provided on regular intervals when annual appropriations are at the industry standard are nearly as efficient as annual appropriations at twice the rate of industry standards and increase the amount of accumulated resource values to nearly the same level. However, periodic increases in funding may increase the risks posed to buildings from the probability of a natural hazard (that is, damage or loss from a hurricane).

Despite a high level of scholarly interest in climate change impacts on natural and socio-economic systems, a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of climate change on cultural heritage and resources across various continents and disciplines is noticeably absent from the literature. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review methodology to identify and characterize the state of knowledge and how the cultural heritage and resources at risk from climate change are being explored globally. Results from 124 reviewed publications show that scholarly interest in the topic is increasing, employs a wide range of research methods, and represents diverse natural and social science disciplines. Despite such increasing and diverse interest in climate change and cultural heritage and resources, the geographic scope of research is limited (predominantly European focused).

Cultural resources, such as historic buildings, in coastal areas are vulnerable to climate impacts including inundation, deterioration, and destruction from sea-level rise and storm-related flooding and erosion. However, research that assesses the trade-offs between actions for protecting vulnerable and valuable cultural resources under budgetary constraints is limited. This study focused on developing a decision support model for managing historic buildings at Cape Lookout National Seashore. We designed the Optimal Preservation Decision Support (OptiPres) model to: (a) identify optimal, annual adaptation actions for historic buildings across a 30-year planning horizon, (b) quantify trade-offs between different actions and the timing of adaptation actions under constrained budgets, and (c) estimate the effectiveness of budget allocations on the resource value of historic buildings. Our analysis of the model suggests that: (1) funding allocation thresholds may exist for national parks to maintain the historical significance and use potential of historic buildings under climate change, (2) the quantitative assessment of trade-offs among alternative adaptation actions provides generalizable guidance for decision makers about the dynamics of their managed system, and (3) the OptiPres model can identify cost-efficient approaches to allocate funding to maintain the historical value of buildings vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Therefore, the OptiPres model, while not designed as a prescriptive decision tool, allows managers to understand the consequences of proposed adaptation actions.

We gathered 83 publicly accessible natural resource management plans from the southeastern United States that included management of LLP ecosystems between 1999 and 2016. We used document analysis to identify how plans addressed climate change threats on LLP, considered climate change in identification of LLP ecosystems, and linked climate change to planned conservation actions for LLP ecosystems.

Additionally, state wildlife action plans and forest action plans tended to score higher than other types of plans, such as plans from the Department of Defense, U.S. Forest Service, and NGOs. Considering climate vulnerability in planning efforts of LLP ecosystems is an opportunity because LLP represents a hopeful context for conserving vulnerable wildlife species as ecosystems adapt and evolve. Limited consideration of climate change as a criterion for identifying or evaluating LLP ecosystems by agencies may result from climate discourse focusing on ecosystems most vulnerable, versus resilient to, climate change.

Employing a collaborative, forward-looking conservation approach represents a key step towards addressing these challenges and was the impetus for the establishment of the Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS).

The federally-funded State Wildlife Grant (SWG) Program, and required State Wildlife Action Plans (SWAPs), are important resources that help states identify and protect declining species and their habitats. SWAPs also provide a framework and opportunity to foster the proactive strategies necessary to achieve the vision established under SECAS, and to help ensure that ongoing and future conservation efforts across the region will be as effective as possible. To help set the stage for this continuing work, the Vital Futures Project \u2014 a collaboration among the National Wildlife Federation, North Carolina State University, and University of South Carolina \u2014 assessed how states have addressed current and projected climate change in their recently updated Wildlife Action Plans.

The final product provides projections of future climate at a 2km horizontal resolution based on three global climate models and two regional climate models for a scenario with high greenhouse gas emissions. Results from the projections suggest that for Puerto Rico, annual temperature would increase between 1\u00b0C and 1.3\u00b0C by mid-century with larger temperature increases located in the interior portion of the island. Precipitation totals decrease for much of the island with island average decline between 12% and 19%, with some potentially large localized decreases exceeding 30%.

Five island-wide and multidecadal averages of daily precipitation and temperature were estimated by way of a climatology-informed interpolation of the site-specific downscaled climate model output. Annual cooling degree-days (CDD) were calculated as a proxy index for air-conditioning energy demand, and two measures of annual no-rainfall days were used as drought indices. Holdridge life zone classification was used to map the possible ecological effects of climate change. Precipitation is predicted to decline in both model ensembles, but the decrease was more severe in the \u201cregionally consistent\u201d models.

These managers want to determine project success in accordance with stated project objectives, and also address critical uncertainties that would inform future decisions on design templates and island performance.  They are looking for a process that can help develop adaptive management actions and tools to guide adaptive decision-making within the context of project construction, maintenance, and future prioritization of conservation actions. SDM is a collaborative process that includes stakeholders and scientists to define management objectives, alternative actions, external drivers, predictive models, and quantitative methods for optimization and tradeoff analysis to identify optimal decisions and key uncertainties to be addressed through further gathering of information (Conroy and Peterson 2012 and Gregory et al., 2012). Under the MsCIP program, SDM was applied to the Barrier Island Restoration on Ship Island to provide a formal, transparent and replicable process for analyzing decisions about repairing storm-related damages that may arise during island construction to help support their existing AM program. \nThe original objective of the project was to use SDM for developing a shared conservation framework and vision of comprehensive barrier island restoration planning, implementation, and assessment in the face of climate change within the northern Gulf of Mexico, using the MsCIP Barrier Island Restoration at Ship Island as a case study.  A decision tool tied to various future barrier island system conditions associated with estimating sand loss volumes and costs of repair was designed for the MsCIP to ensure management decisions optimize the sustainability of the constructed barrier island project while also accounting for stakeholder input and uncertainty about future system change (i.e. potential storm related damages).  This process established a framework to make defensible, transparent, efficient and coordinated decisions to optimize barrier island restoration at Ship Island in the Gulf of Mexico. The developed framework provided a template that could be expanded and carried forward providing opportunities to refine to specific adaptive management needs for other projects and programs in the future.\nDuring the development of the proposal the original intent was to use the MsCIP as a case study for development of a prototype decision making tool for barrier island restoration and conservation in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  Once developed, other regional program managers would be engaged to refine and adapt the draft decision framework to broaden its applicability beyond Mississippi to barrier island restoration and conservation throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico. It was not known however when scoping the project the level of detail that would be necessary to provide a ready to use decision model.  After development of the first prototype it was determined by the stakeholder team that it would be more beneficial to the resource community and the MsCIP to add additional detail to the decision tool to create a very detailed ready to use product that could guide decisions related to barrier island construction rather than engage regional program managers in a general framework.\n", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=565e07b3e4b071e7ea5435d0"}, "57d6db77e4b090824ff87b67": {"title": "Use of structured decision-making to explicitly incorporate environmental process understanding in management of coastal restoration projects: Case study on barrier islands of the northern Gulf of Mexico", "contacts": [{"name": "Patricia (Soupy) A Dalyander", "type": "Author", "email": "sdalyander@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Oceanographer", "orcId": "0000-0001-9583-0872"}, {"name": "Michelle B Meyers", "type": "Author", "email": "mmeyers@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Brady Mattsson", "type": "Author", "email": "bmattsson@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Gregory D Steyer", "type": "Author", "email": "steyerg@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0001-7231-0110"}, {"name": "Elizabeth Godsey", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Justin McDonald", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Mark Byrnes", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Mark Ford", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Southeast CASC", "fy": "2013", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/57d6db77e4b090824ff87b67", "parentId": "5224e64fe4b0e4746d62af85", "proj_id": "5224d2f8e4b0e4746d62af29", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=57d6db77e4b090824ff87b67"}, "568c2ca4e4b0e7594ee77882": {"title": "Webinar Presentation - Open Pine Management: Decision Making Factors", "contacts": [{"name": "Jenni G.

To better understand the planning practice associated with this system, we assessed the quality of 35 management plans from federal, state, and nongovernmental agencies. We found that newer plans scored higher than older plans, suggesting agencies may be learning to develop better plans over time and indicating older plans should be prioritized for revision. Plans from federal and state agencies scored higher than plans from nongovernmental agencies, reflecting differences in agency missions and resources. The fact base scored high across most plans, whereas actions and implementation scored lower. Although agencies tended to perform best on fact base, our results suggest having a strong fact base has little influence on other components. To improve actions and implementation, planners should consider incorporating more stakeholder participation to help them develop better actions and implementation indirectly through improved problem and objective statements. We also investigated how decisions were being made and what barriers \u2013 if any \u2013 faced decision makers. To gain this insight, we conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with key decision makers and stakeholders and our findings emphasized the challenge of collaboration between individuals, governmental and non-governmental organizations. We found discrepancies between groups on everything from objectives and goals, to how decisions are made, the barriers groups are facing, information that is used to make those decisions and where information comes from as well as differences in decision making timing and frequency. Agency managers had firm objectives while landowners/private land managers had flexible objectives that changed based on new goals, knowledge and information. In the same vein, agency managers said it was hard to change their management plans but landowners/private land managers said that their management plans were constantly changing to meet their shifting objectives. Agency managers reported that they had access to all of the information they needed to make \u201cgood\u201d decisions while landowners/private managers said that they wanted and needed more information, specifically better economic and growth data. And although agency managers said climate change was a factor when making decisions, landowners/private land managers said that climate change was not a decision making factor. To bridge the gap between the two groups and increase information sharing, a library of regulatory requirements, scientific data, personal experiences and fiscal information may be a way to align management objectives and goals.

Spartina alterniflora Loisel (Poaceae) is a foundation species that builds and maintains salt marshes. Despite this species' importance, much of its basic reproductive biology is not well understood, including flowering phenology, seed production, and the effects of flowering on growth and biomass allocation. We sought to better understand these life history traits and use that knowledge to consider how this species may be affected by climate change.     Methods: We examined temporal and spatial patterns in flowering and seed production in S. alterniflora at a latitudinal scale (along the U.S. Atlantic coast), regional scale (within New England), and local scale (among subhabitats within marshes) and determined the impact of flowering on growth allocation using field and greenhouse studies.     Key results: Flowering stem density did not vary along a latitudinal gradient, while at the local scale plants in the less submerged panne subhabitats produced fewer flowers and seeds than those in more frequently submerged subhabitats.

Coastal refuges are already experiencing threats from sea-level rise and other change processes that are largely beyond their ability to influence, while at the same time facing tighter budgets and reduced staff. We engaged in workshops with NWR managers along the U.S. Atlantic coast to understand the problems they face from global-change processes and began a multidisciplinary collaboration to use decision science to help address them. We are applying a values-focused approach to base management decisions on the resource objectives of land managers, as well as those of stakeholders who may benefit from the goods and services produced by a refuge. Two insights that emerged from our workshops were a conspicuous mismatch between the scale at which management can influence outcomes and the scale of environmental processes, and the need to consider objectives related to ecosystem goods and services that traditionally have not been explicitly considered by refuges (e.g., protection from storm surge). The broadening of objectives complicates the decision-making process, but also provides opportunities for collaboration with stakeholders who may have agendas different from those of the refuge, as well as an opportunity for addressing problems across scales. From a practical perspective, we recognized the need to (1) efficiently allocate limited staff time and budgets for short-term management of existing programs and resources under the current refuge design and (2) develop long-term priorities for acquiring or protecting new land/habitat to supplement or replace the existing refuge footprint and thus sustain refuge values as the system evolves over time. Structuring the decision-making problem in this manner facilitated a better understanding of the issues of scale and suggested that a long-term solution will require a significant reassessment of objectives to better reflect the comprehensive values of refuges to society.

Spartina alterniflora Loisel (smooth cordgrass) is the dominant salt marsh-building plant along the US Atlantic coast. It maintains salt marsh elevation relative to sea level by the accumulation of aboveground biomass, which promotes sediment deposition and belowground biomass, which accretes as peat. Peat accumulation is particularly important in elevation maintenance at high latitudes where sediment supply tends to be limited. Latitudinal variation in S. alterniflora growth was quantified in eight salt marshes from Massachusetts to South Carolina. The hypothesis that allocation to aboveground and belowground biomass is phenotypically plastic was tested with transplant experiments among a subset of salt marshes along this gradient. Reciprocal transplants revealed that northern S. alterniflora decreased allocation to belowground biomass when grown in the south. Some northern plants also died when moved south, suggesting that northern S. alterniflora may be stressed by future warming. Southern plants that were moved north showed phenotypic plasticity in biomass allocation, but no mortality. Belowground biomass also decomposed more quickly in southern marshes. Our results suggest that warming will lead northern S. alterniflora to decrease belowground allocation and that belowground biomass will decompose more quickly, thus decreasing peat accumulation.

Unfortunately, herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant on urban than rural trees, reducing tree growth, survival, and ecosystem services. Previous research where vegetation complexity was reduced has attributed elevated urban pest abundance to decreased regulation by natural enemies. However, reducing vegetation complexity, particularly the density of overstory trees, also makes cities hotter than natural habitats. We ask how urban habitat characteristics influence an abiotic factor, temperature, and a biotic factor, natural enemy abundance, in regulating the abundance of an urban forest pest, the gloomy scale, (Melanaspis tenebricosa). We used a map of surface temperature to select red maple trees (Acer rubrum) at warmer and cooler sites in Raleigh, NC. We quantified habitat complexity by measuring impervious surface cover, local vegetation structural complexity, and landscape scale vegetation cover around each tree. Using path analysis, we determined that impervious surface (the most important habitat variable) increased scale insect abundance by increasing tree canopy temperature, rather than by reducing natural enemy abundance or percent parasitism. As a mechanism for this response, we found that increasing temperature significantly increases scale insect fecundity and contributes to greater population increase. Specifically, adult female M. tenebricosa egg sets increased by approximately fourteen eggs for every 1&deg; C increase in temperature. Climate change models predict that the global climate will increase by 2-3&deg; C in the next 50-100 years, which we found would increase scale insect abundance by three orders of magnitude. This result supports predictions that urban and natural forests will face greater herbivory in the future, and suggests that a primary cause could be direct, positive effects of warming on herbivore fitness rather than altered trophic interactions.

Herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant in urban than in rural areas, and urban outbreaks have been attributed to reduced control by predators and parasitoids and to increased susceptibility of stressed urban plants. These hypotheses, however, leave many outbreaks unexplained and fail to predict variation in pest abundance within cities. Here we show that the abundance of a common insect pest is positively related to temperature even when controlling for other habitat characteristics. The scale insect   Parthenolecanium quercifex was 13 times more abundant on willow oak trees in the hottest parts of Raleigh, NC, in the southeastern United States, than in cooler areas, though parasitism rates were similar. We further separated the effects of heat from those of natural enemies and plant quality in a greenhouse reciprocal transplant experiment.   P. quercifex collected from hot urban trees became more abundant in hot greenhouses than in cool greenhouses, whereas the abundance of   P. quercifex collected from cooler urban trees remained low in hot and cool greenhouses.   Parthenolecanium quercifexliving in urban hot spots succeed with warming, and they do so because some demes have either acclimatized or adapted to high temperatures.

Here, we examine how temperature affects the abundance of a scale insect,  Melanaspis tenebricosa (Comstock) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), on one of the most commonly planted street trees in the eastern U.S. Next, we examine how both pest abundance and temperature are associated with water stress, growth, and condition of 26 urban street trees.

Our results support previous studies linking warmer urban habitats to greater pest abundance and extend this association to show its effect on street tree condition.

Here we ask how urbanization affects the immune response and pathogen load of feral and managed colonies of honey bees (  Apis mellifera Linnaeus), the predominant economically important pollinator worldwide. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we measured expression of 4 immune genes and relative abundance of 10 honey bee pathogens. We also measured worker survival in a laboratory bioassay. We found that pathogen pressure on honey bees increased with urbanization and management, and the probability of worker survival declined 3-fold along our urbanization gradient. The effect of management on pathogens appears to be mediated by immunity, with feral bees expressing immune genes at nearly twice the levels of managed bees following an immune challenge.

We examined a novel ecosystem service relevant to urban public health and esthetics: the consumption of littered food waste by arthropods. Theory and data from natural systems suggest that the magnitude and resilience of this service should increase with biological diversity. We measured food removal by presenting known quantities of cookies, potato chips, and hot dogs in street medians (24 sites) and parks (21 sites) in New York City, USA. At the same sites, we assessed ground-arthropod diversity and abiotic conditions, including history of flooding during Hurricane Sandy 7 months prior to the study. Arthropod diversity was greater in parks (on average 11 hexapod families and 4.7 ant species per site), than in medians (nine hexapod families and 2.7 ant species per site). However, counter to our diversity-based prediction, arthropods in medians removed 2-3 times more food per day than did those in parks. We detected no effect of flooding (at 19 sites) on this service. Instead, greater food removal was associated with the presence of the introduced pavement ant (Tetramorium sp. E) and with hotter, drier conditions that may have increased arthropod metabolism. When vertebrates also had access to food, more was removed, indicating that arthropods and vertebrates compete for littered food. We estimate that arthropods alone could remove 4-6.5 kg of food per year in a single street median, reducing its availability to less desirable fauna such as rats. Our results suggest that species identity and habitat may be more relevant than diversity for predicting urban ecosystem services. Even small green spaces such as street medians provide ecosystem services that may complement those of larger habitat patches across the urban landscape.

We measured the effect of experimental warming of 0.6\u20135.0 &deg;C on the phenology of a diverse suite of 11 plant species in the deciduous forest understory (Duke Forest, North Carolina, USA) in a relatively warm year (2011) and a colder year (2013). Our primary goal was to dissect how temperature affects timing of spring budburst, flowering, and autumn leaf coloring for functional groups with different growth habits, phenological niches, and xylem anatomy. Warming advanced budburst of six deciduous woody species by 5\u201315 days and delayed leaf coloring by 18\u201321 days, resulting in an extension of the growing season by as much as 20\u201329 days. Spring temperature accumulation was strongly correlated with budburst date, but temperature alone cannot explain the diverse budburst responses observed among plant functional types. Ring-porous trees showed a consistent temperature response pattern across years, suggesting these species are sensitive to photoperiod. Conversely, diffuse-porous species responded differently between years, suggesting winter chilling may be more important in regulating budburst. Budburst of the ring-porous   Quercus alba responded nonlinearly to warming, suggesting evolutionary constraints may limit changes in phenology, and therefore productivity, in the future. Warming caused a divergence in flowering times among species in the forest community, resulting in a longer flowering season by 10-16 days. Temperature was a good predictor of flowering for only four of the seven species studied here. Observations of interannual temperature variability overpredicted flowering responses in spring-blooming species, relative to our warming experiment, and did not consistently predict even the direction of flowering shifts.

Here, we ask whether these documented latitudinal patterns can be generalized to predict arthropod responses to warming across mid- and high temperate latitudes, for taxa whose thermal physiology has not been measured. To address this question, we used a novel natural experiment consisting of a series of urban warming gradients at different latitudes. Specifically, we sampled arthropods from a single common street tree species across temperature gradients in four US cities, located from 35.8 to 42.4\u00b0 latitude. We captured 6746 arthropods in 34 families from 111 sites that varied in summer average temperature by 1.7\u20133.4 \u00b0C within each city. Arthropod responses to warming within each city were characterized as Poisson regression coefficients describing change in abundance per \u00b0C for each family. Family responses in the two midlatitude cities were heterogeneous, including significantly negative and positive effects, while those in high-latitude cities varied no more than expected by chance within each city. We expected high-latitude taxa to increase in abundance with warming, and they did so in one of the two high-latitude cities; in the other, Queens (New York City), most taxa declined with warming, perhaps due to habitat loss that was correlated with warming in this city. With the exception of Queens, patterns of family responses to warming were consistent with predictions based on known latitudinal patterns in arthropod physiology relative to regional climate.

In this experiment we manipulated temperature in field-based, open-top chambers for three years to examine the relationship between biotic interactions and climatic warming on the population dynamics of seedlings of Quercus alba. We investigated the effect of warming on rates of insect herbivory on Q. alba seedlings. Additionally, we assessed the relative effects of increasing temperature, insect herbivory, and conspecific density on seedling survival. We found two unexpected results.

We found that some\u2014but not all\u2014ant species living in Manhattan's most urbanized habitats had \u03b413C signatures associated with processed human foods.

The gopher tortoise  is a \u201ckeystone\u201d species, meaning that its disappearance from the landscape would negatively impact  many other species that make use of its underground burrows.  Out of concern over its decline and its  important role in the ecosystem, the gopher tortoise is being considered for listing under the federal  Endangered Species Act across its range.  However, because gopher tortoises occur on many private  lands, federal listing could have widespread impacts on the economy of the region and the livelihood of  its citizens.  The State of Georgia is interested in conserving lands to safeguard tortoise populations  within its borders and ultimately make federal listing unnecessary.  We undertook research to better  understand life history patterns and habitat affiliations of the tortoise and to evaluate alternative  strategies for creating networks of conservation reserves.  In one effort, we recaptured wild tortoises  first marked in research conducted over 20 years ago, and we used these data to refine our knowledge  about long\u2010term survival and movement patterns.

We developed an approach to estimate persistence using only occurrence records of the target species and citizen science occurrence data of non-target species to account for search effort and imperfect detection. We applied the approach to a highly cryptic and data-limited species, the southern hognose snake (Heterodon simus), as part of its USFWS Species Status Assessment, and estimated current (in 2018) and future persistence under plausible scenarios of varying levels of urbanization, sea level rise, and management.

This report inventories and then directly examines and compares a subset of hydrologic models used to estimate streamflow at a number of gauged basins across the SEUS and PR. This effort was designed to evaluate, quantify, and compare the magnitude of error and to investigate the potential causes of error associated with predicted streamflows from seven hydrologic models of varying complexity and calibration strategy. This was accomplished by computing and then comparing classical hydrologic model fit statistics (e.g., mean bias, coefficient of determination [R2], root mean squared error [RMSE], Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency [NSE]) and understanding the bias in the prediction in these and a subset of ecologically relevant flow metrics (ERFMs). Additionally, streamflow predictions from a larger regional-scale hydrologic model were compared to those of several fine-scale hydrologic models under a range of hypothetical climate change scenarios to determine the range of predicted streamflow responses to fixed climate perturbations. A pilot study was conducted using predicted streamflow and boosted regression trees to develop a set of predictive flow-ecology response models to assess the potential change in fish species richness in the North Carolina Piedmont under several scenarios of water availability change. This report is intended to provide a general assessment of all the tools and techniques available to support hydrologic modeling for flow-ecology science in the SEUS and PR.

Changes in climate, land use and water use practices may alter water availability. Understanding the potential effect of these changes on aquatic ecosystems is critical for long-term water management to maintain a balance between water for human consumption and ecosystem needs. \tFish species data and streamflow estimates from a rainfall-runoff and flow routing model were used to develop boosted regression tree models to predict the relationship between streamflow and fish species richness (FSR) under plausible scenarios of (1) water withdrawal, (2) climate change and (3) increases in impervious surfaces in the Piedmont ecoregion of North Carolina, U.S.A. Maximum monthly flow, the fraction of total flow originating from impervious surface runoff, coefficient of monthly streamflow variability, and the specific river basin accounted for 50% of the variability in FSR. This model was used to predict FSR values for all twelve-digit Hydrological Unit Code catchments (HUC-12s) in the North Carolina Piedmont under current flow conditions and under water withdrawal, climate change and impervious surface scenarios. \tFlow\u2013ecology modeling results indicate that predicted FSR declined significantly with increased water withdrawals. However, the magnitude of decline varied geographically. A \u201chot-spot\u201d analysis was conducted based on predicted changes in FSR under each scenario to understand which HUC-12s were most likely to be affected by changes in water withdrawals, climate and impervious surfaces. Under the 20% withdrawal increase scenario, 413 of 886 (47%) HUC-12s in the study area were predicted to lose one or more species. HUC-12s in the Broad, Catawba, Yadkin and Cape Fear river basins were most susceptible to species loss. \tThese findings may help decision making efforts by identifying catchments most vulnerable to changing water availability. Additionally, FSR-discharge modeling results can assist resource agencies, water managers and stakeholders in assessing the effect of water withdrawals in catchments to better support the protection and long-term conservation of species.

One problem for wildlife as their ranges shift is that their path is often impeded by habitat fragmentation. Because of this, the most common recommended strategy to protect wildlife as climate changes is to connect their habitats, providing them safe passage. There are great challenges to implementing this strategy in the southeastern US, however, because most intervening lands between habitat patches are held in private ownership. In partnership with South Atlantic LCC members, we assessed current and projected connectivity for three species that inhabit bottomland hardwoods throughout the southeastern US: black bear ( Ursus americanus), Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bat ( Corynorhinus rafinesquii), and timber rattlesnake ( Crotalus horridus).  For each species, we measured connectivity using three different modeling approaches that incorporated three types of resistance layers. We found that there was not a high degree of overlap between connectivity models for each species, suggesting a limited capacity for \u201cumbrella\u201d estimates of connectivity. Incorporating climate change showed that on average under future climate conditions, linkages decreased in suitability compared to current conditions. These results suggest that, for these three species at least, connectivity modeling should focus on species-specific traits. Managers should be aware that outcomes of connectivity modeling may be specific to the type of model used, and potentially consider multiple species planning for connectivity in a region.

However, before the impact of projected climate changes on crop production can be addressed, a necessary first step is the assessment of the inherent uncertainty and limitations of the forcing data used in these crop models. In this paper, we evaluate the simulated crop production using separate crop models for maize (summer crop) and wheat (winter crop) over six different locations in the Southeastern United States forced with multiple sources of actual and simulated weather data. The paper compares the crop production simulated by a crop model for maize and wheat during a historical period, using daily weather data from three sources: station observations, dynamically downscaled global reanalysis, and dynamically downscaled historical climate model simulations from two global circulation models (GCMs). The same regional climate model is used to downscale the global reanalysis and both global circulation models\u2019 historical simulation. The average simulated yield derived from bias-corrected downscaled reanalysis or bias-corrected downscaled GCMs were, in most cases, not statistically different from observations. Statistical differences of the average yields, generated from observed or downscaled GCM weather, were found in some locations under rainfed and irrigated scenarios, and more frequently in winter (wheat) than in summer (maize). The inter-annual variance of simulated crop yield using GCM downscaled data was frequently overestimated, especially in summer. An analysis of the bias-corrected climate data showed that despite the agreement between the modeled and the observed means of temperatures, solar radiation, and precipitation, their intra-seasonal variances were often significantly different from observations. Therefore, due to this high intra-seasonal variability, a cautious approach is required when using climate model data for historical yield analysis and future climate change impact assessments.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/552c1210e4b0b22a157f4f68", "parentId": "505b5dc8e4b08c986b30c260", "proj_id": "5016ca07e4b06fb5ce8b736f", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=552c1210e4b0b22a157f4f68"}, "560c2e66e4b058f706e54107": {"title": "Final Memo for Synthesis of climate model downscaling products for the southeastern United States", "contacts": [{"name": "Ryan Boyles", "type": "Author", "email": "ryan_boyles@ncsu.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Southeast Climate Science Center", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Southeast CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "Climate change is likely to have many effects on natural ecosystems in the Southeast U.S. While there is information available to conservation managers and ecologists from the global climate models (GCMs), this information is at too coarse a resolution for use in vulnerability assessments and decision making.

In parts of the southeastern United States, climate change is expected to result in the poleward range expansion of black mangroves (  Avicennia germinans) at the expense of some salt marsh vegetation. The morphology of  A. germinans at its northern range limit is more shrub-like than in tropical climes in part due to the aboveground structural damage and vigorous multi-stem regrowth triggered by extreme winter temperatures. In this study, we developed aboveground allometric equations for freeze-affected black mangroves which can be used to quantify: (1) total aboveground biomass; (2) leaf biomass; (3) stem plus branch biomass; and (4) leaf area. Plant volume (i.e., a combination of crown area and plant height) was selected as the optimal predictor of the four response variables. We expect that our simple measurements and equations can be adapted for use in other mangrove ecosystems located in abiotic settings that result in mangrove individuals with dwarf or shrub-like morphologies including oligotrophic and arid environments. Many important ecological functions and services are affected by changes in coastal wetland plant community structure and productivity including carbon storage, nutrient cycling, coastal protection, recreation, fish and avian habitat, and ecosystem response to sea level rise and extreme climatic events.

Here, we consider the influence of climatic drivers on the distribution of foundation plant species within coastal wetlands of the conterminous USA. Using region-level syntheses, we identified 24 dominant foundation plant species within 12 biogeographic regions, and we categorized species and biogeographic regions into four groups: graminoids, mangroves, succulents, and unvegetated. Literature searches were used to characterize the level of research directed at each of the 24 species. Most coastal wetlands research has been focused on a subset of foundation species, with about 45% of publications directed at just one grass species\u2014Spartina alterniflora. An additional 14 and 8% have been directed, respectively, at two mangrove species\u2014Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans. At the national scale, winter temperature extremes govern the distribution of mangrove forests relative to salt marsh graminoids, and arid conditions can produce hypersaline conditions that increase the dominance of succulent plants, algal mats, and unvegetated tidal flats (i.e., salt flats, salt pans) relative to graminoid and mangrove plants. Collectively, our analyses illustrate the diversity of foundation plant species in the conterminous USA and begin to elucidate the influence of climatic drivers on their distribution. However, our results also highlight critical knowledge gaps and identify emerging research needs for assessing climate change impacts.

Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools.  4.At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development.  5.Synthesis: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant-soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant-soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/56f16c2ae4b0f59b85de0b2f", "parentId": "505b584fe4b08c986b30c22f", "proj_id": "5016c89be4b06fb5ce8b736a", "purpose": "",

Our study specifically addressed the following questions: (1) How do ecological processes and ecosystem properties differ between salt marshes and mangrove forests; (2) As mangrove forests develop, how do their ecosystem properties change and how do these properties compare to salt marshes; (3) How do plant-soil interactions across mangrove forest structural gradients differ among three distinct locations that span the northern Gulf of Mexico; and (4) What are the implications of mangrove forest encroachment and development into salt marsh in terms of soil development, carbon and nitrogen storage, and soil strength?", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=545bfe0fe4b009f8aec9b6fe"}, "5b16da85e4b092d9651fcae4": {"title": "Winter climate change and coastal wetland foundation species in the southeastern United States", "contacts": [{"name": "Nicholas M Enwright", "type": "Point of Contact", "email": "enwrightn@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Geographer", "orcId": "0000-0002-7887-3261"}, {"name": "Michael J Osland", "type": "Originator", "email": "mosland@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Research Ecologist", "orcId": "0000-0001-9902-8692"}, {"name": "Nicholas M Enwright", "type": "Originator", "email": "enwrightn@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Geographer", "orcId": "0000-0002-7887-3261"}, {"name": "Ryan Day", "type": "Originator", "email": "rday@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": "0000-0002-5959-7054"}, {"name": "Thomas W Doyle", "type": "Originator", "email": "doylet@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "ECOLOGIST (RESEARCH)", "orcId": "0000-0001-5754-0671"}, {"name": "Nicholas M Enwright", "type": "Metadata Contact", "email": "enwrightn@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Geographer", "orcId": "0000-0002-7887-3261"}, {"name": "U.S. Geological Survey", "type": "Publisher", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "U.S. Geological Survey - ScienceBase", "type": "Distributor", "email": "sciencebase@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Wetland and Aquatic Research Center", "type": "SDC Data Owner", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Ecosystems", "type": "USGS Mission Area", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Southeast CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "In this study, we investigated the potential effect of winter climate change upon salt marsh and mangrove forest foundation species in the southeastern United States.

We synthesized data and literature related to three components of vulnerability: climate sensitivity, climate change exposure, and adaptive capacity. We also summarized all information into a qualitative vulnerability rating for each ecosystem. Based on the available information, we identified critical management actions for reducing the vulnerability of each ecosystem. Next, for two of the twelve ecosystems, we used NatureServe\u2019s Habitat Climate Change Vulnerability Index (HCCVI) framework as an alternative approach for assessing vulnerability. Using the HCCVI, we developed a numeric vulnerability rating for the two ecosystems. Of the twelve ecosystems we assessed in the first approach, five were rated as having high vulnerability, six had moderate vulnerability, and one had low vulnerability. For the two ecosystems we assessed with both approaches, vulnerability ratings generally agreed. Important conservation strategies we identified to reduce vulnerability and improve adaptive capacity for the ecosystems included maintaining connectivity, restoring or maintaining disturbance processes, and minimizing the effects of urbanization. This synthesis of this information for key ecosystems across the entire Southeast and Caribbean will enable regional decision-makers to prioritize current efforts and plan future research and monitoring for conservation of these important ecosystems.

During the development of natural resource policy, RPs have been variously treated as either \u2018targets\u2019 or \u2018triggers\u2019. Under a SDM/AM paradigm, target RPs correspond approximately to value-based objectives, which may in turn be either of fundamental interest to stakeholders or intermediaries to other central objectives.

Casting RPs as triggers or targets within a SDM framework is helpful towards clarifying why (or whether) a particular metric is appropriate. Further, the benefits of a SDM/AM process include elucidation of underlying untested assumptions that may reveal alternative metrics for use as RPs. Likewise, a structured decision-analytic framework may also reveal that failure to achieve management goals is not because the metrics are wrong, but because the decision-making process in which they are embedded is insufficiently robust to uncertainty, is not efficiently directed at producing a resource objective, or is incapable of adaptation to new knowledge.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/51d2f8e1e4b0ca1848338b81", "parentId": "505b60cfe4b08c986b30c417", "proj_id": "5016ce88e4b06fb5ce8b737c", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=51d2f8e1e4b0ca1848338b81"}, "579f9c44e4b0589fa1cd558e": {"title": "Turning Uncertainty Into Useful Information For Conservation Decisions", "contacts": [{"name": "Brian J Irwin", "type": "Co-Investigator", "email": "bjirwin@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "AUL-F, Research Fish Biologist", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Brian Crawford", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Tara Gancos Crawford", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Clinton Moore", "type": "Cooperator/Partner", "email": "cmoore@usgs.gov", "jobTitle": "Assistant Unit Leader-Wildife", "orcId": "0000-0002-6053-2880"}], "casc": "Southeast CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "UNCERTAINTY IS ALWAYS PRESENT in conservation and other socio-ecological decisions, which can make choices uncomfortable and challenging.

The objective of this study is to examine how precipitation change-associated vegetation dynamics may regulate catchment water balance in a semiarid to arid mountain ecosystem. To achieve this objective, R-RHESSys, which is short for rasterised regional hydro-ecological simulation system, a distributed hydro-ecological model, was applied to the Cleve Creek watershed in the eastern Nevada, USA. Simulation results from two scenarios based on altered precipitations were compared, respectively, to those from a baseline scenario based on observed precipitations. Our results suggest that R-RHESSys can accurately simulate catchment water balance and vegetation dynamics in the study area. In addition, we found that (i) precipitation-associated shifts in leaf canopy can help reduce flood potentials during wet years or sustain baseflow during dry years through changing evapotranspiration (ET); (ii) precipitation-associated decrease in leaf canopy and consequent decrease in ET do not always increase streamflow and vice versa. The regulation of precipitation-associated vegetation dynamics on streamflow is subject to initial soil water condition; (iii) vegetation-associated shifts in plant transpiration play an important role in regulating soil water content and streamflow generation in the semiarid and arid mountain watershed; and (iv) the regulation of precipitation-associated shift in leaf canopy on ET is more pronounced in the ridges of watershed than in valleys. In contrast, its regulation on subsurface flow generation is more remarkable in valleys than in the ridges of watershed.

This study examined the streamflow response to snow regime shifts associated with climate variability in the US Great Basin. To this end, the coupled hydro-ecological simulation system (CHESS), a process-based and distributed model, was applied to four mountain watersheds in the US Great Basin. Historical weather records for the period of 1961\u20131990 were used to spin-up model simulations so that the soil water and vegetation reached the equilibrium state under long-term climate conditions; the period of 1991\u20132015 was selected as the study period. The model evaluation suggested that CHESS was able to simulate major hydrological processes in the four mountain watersheds. In addition, it was found that annual streamflow was more strongly correlated with snowfall than with rainfall during 1991\u20132015 and increased by 0.62\u20130.76\u202fmm as snowfall increased by 1\u202fmm in the study regions. Recent regional warming advanced the timing of the peak flow and shifts in the snow regime also affected the intra-annual pattern of the soil moisture content. Seasonally, spring rainfall and snowmelt were dominant factors in generating spring streamflow and summer baseflow. The mechanisms for flow generation were more complex and more variable in the four watersheds in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. On an annual basis, shifts in snowmelt resulting from climate variability accounted for more than 60% of the variability in the annual streamflow, surpassing the contribution of rainfall in the four watersheds. Overall, our results suggest that shifts in the snow regime due to climate variability have important implications for the intra-annual distribution and availability of water resources in semiarid and arid regions of the US Great Basin.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d5707a5e4b01d82ce8ebb5c", "parentId": "5224e723e4b0e4746d62afa1", "proj_id": "51e44c75e4b08262df3d63d9", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5d5707a5e4b01d82ce8ebb5c"}, "588f7960e4b072a7ac08c2e0": {"title": "Developing Evaluation Indicators to Improve the Process of Coproducing Usable Climate Science", "contacts": [{"name": "Tamara Wall", "type": "Author", "email": "tamara.wall@dri.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Alison Meadow", "type": "Author", "email": "meadow@email.arizona.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Alexandra Horganic", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2013", "summary": "Abstract (from http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/WCAS-D-16-0008.1): Resource managers and decision-makers are increasingly tasked with integrating climate change science into their decisions about resource management and policy development.

The radial growth of high-elevation trees in this semi-arid region captures this temperature and precipitation variability and provides long time series to contextualize instrumental-era variability in synoptic-scale climate patterns. Such variability in climate patterns can trigger extreme climate events, such as droughts, floods, and forest fires, which have a damaging impact on human and natural systems. We developed 11 tree-ring width (TRW) chronologies from multiple species and sites to investigate the seasonal climatic drivers of tree growth in the Bighorn Mountains, WY. A principal component analysis of the chronologies identified 54% of shared common variance (1894\u20132014). Tree growth (expressed by PC1) was driven by multiple seasonal climate variables: previous October and current July temperatures, as well as previous December and current April precipitation, had a positive influence on growth, whereas growth was limited by July precipitation. These seasonal growth-climate relationships corresponded to circulation patterns at higher atmospheric levels over the Bighorn Mountains. Tree growth was enhanced when the winter jet stream was in a northward position, which led to warmer winters, and when the spring jet stream was further south, which led to wetter springs. The second principal component, explaining 19% of the variance, clustered sites by elevation and was strongly related to summer temperature. We leverage this summer temperature signal in our TRW chronologies by combining it with an existing maximum latewood density (MXD) chronology in a nested approach. This allowed us to reconstruct Bighorn Mountains summer (June, July, and August) temperature (BMST) back to 1654, thus extending the instrumental temperature record by 250 years.

It is thought that diversity in precipitation-causing weather events is fundamental in producing heavy-tailed distributions, and it arises from theory that at least one of the precipitation types contributing to a heavy-tailed climatological record must also be heavy-tailed. Precipitation is a multi-scale phenomenon with a rich spatial structure and short decorrelation length and timescales; the spatiotemporal scale at which precipitation is observed is thus an important factor when considering its statistics and extremes. In this study, we examine the spatiotemporal scaling behavior of intense precipitation from point-scale to large grid cells and from 1 day to 4 weeks over the entire globe. We go on to validate the current generation of historically-forced climate models and reanalyses against observational data at consistent spatial scales. Our results demonstrate that the prevalence and magnitude of heavy tails in observations decrease when moving to lower spatiotemporal resolutions, as is consistent with stochastic theory. Reanalyses and climate models generally reproduce large, synoptic scale distribution classifications, but struggle to reproduce the statistics in regions that are strongly affected by mesoscale phenomena.

However, modern climate change has already resulted in distributional shifts of some species and is projected to result in many more shifts in the coming decades. As species redistribute and biotic communities reorganize, conservation plans based on current patterns of biodiversity may fail to adequately protect species in the future. One approach for addressing this issue is to focus on conserving a range of abiotic conditions in the conservation-planning process. By doing so, it may be possible to conserve an abiotically diverse \u201cstage\u201d upon which evolution will play out and support many actors (biodiversity). We reviewed the fundamental underpinnings of the concept of conserving the abiotic stage, starting with the early observations of von Humboldt, who mapped the concordance of abiotic conditions and vegetation, and progressing to the concept of the ecological niche. We discuss challenges posed by issues of spatial and temporal scale, the role of biotic drivers of species distributions, and latitudinal and topographic variation in relationships between climate and landform. For example, abiotic conditions are not static, but change through time\u2014albeit at different and often relatively slow rates. In some places, biotic interactions play a substantial role in structuring patterns of biodiversity, meaning that patterns of biodiversity may be less tightly linked to the abiotic stage. Furthermore, abiotic drivers of biodiversity can change with latitude and topographic position, meaning that the abiotic stage may need to be defined differently in different places. We conclude that protecting a diversity of abiotic conditions will likely best conserve biodiversity into the future in places where abiotic drivers of species distributions are strong relative to biotic drivers, where the diversity of abiotic settings will be conserved through time, and where connectivity allows for movement among areas providing different abiotic conditions.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58a0fbf0e4b0c8251285643d", "parentId": "526abfdde4b0be4db9fbf29b", "proj_id": "526abfcee4b0be4db9fbf296", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=58a0fbf0e4b0c8251285643d"}, "54fdb302e4b02419550de9bb": {"title": "Identification of geophysically diverse locations that may facilitate species\u2019 persistence and adaptation to climate change in the southwestern United States", "contacts": [{"name": "Christine Albano", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2013", "summary": "Abstract (from http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-015-0167-7/fulltext.html):  Context Conservation of geophysical diversity has been proposed as a strategy for conserving species diversity and facilitating adaptive capacity of species in the face of changing climate. Existing protected areas may not correspond to the most geophysically diverse places because they have typically not been selected on this basis. Objectives My objectives were to characterize geophysical diversity in the southwestern United States, assess the sensitivity of my results to methodological choices, and assess the degree to which the existing protected areas network in this region captures geophysically diverse places. Methods I classified the region into geophysically distinct units (land facets) on the basis of topographic and edaphic variables. I calculated land facet diversity on the basis of multiple classification methods, thematic resolutions, and spatial scales (i.e., spatial grain and neighborhood size), assessed the sensitivity of land-facet diversity estimates to these methods, and integrated the results to provide a multi-scaled estimate of geophysical diversity. I used gap analysis to assess the proportion of lands with high land-facet diversity that is protected. Results Land facet diversity estimates were more sensitive to spatial scale than to methods, but results based on different methods or spatial scales typically were highly correlated.

Visitor use is highly seasonal and occurs primarily during the summer months when temperatures are warm and daylight is long. Climate is an important consideration when planning a trip to Alaska\u2019s national parks because of the great distances and associated costs of travel for many visitors. As a result of projected climate warming, peak visitor season of use in Alaska\u2019s national parks may expand. To examine the potential effects of warming climate on park visitor season of use, we used regression analyses to quantify the relationship between historical (1980\u20132009) visitor use and monthly temperatures for three Alaskan national parks and identifi ed the monthly mean temperatures at which the peak visitor season of use occurred in each park. We compared these contemporary temperatures with projected future average monthly mean temperatures for 2040\u20132049 and 2090\u20132099 to provide context for how visitation might be affected by warming climate. Based on historical relationships among temperature, visitor use, and increased temperatures associated with climate change, our analysis suggests that peak season of visitor use could expand into May and September depending on the park, the climate scenario, and the time period. As a consequence of a warming climate, planning by the National Park Service and other stakeholders may need to consider this transition in temperatures and the potential for an extended peak season of visitor use, along with other climate-related changes (e.g., extreme weather), climate-induced environmental changes, and shifts in recreational opportunities that will likely accompany climate change.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58a6268de4b025c4642735cd", "parentId": "526abfdde4b0be4db9fbf29b", "proj_id": "526abfcee4b0be4db9fbf296", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=58a6268de4b025c4642735cd"}, "546e2774e4b0fc7976bf1ed2": {"title": "Systematic identification of potential conservation priority areas on roadless Bureau of Land Management lands in the western United States", "contacts": [{"name": "Brett Dickson", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Luke Zachmann", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Christine Albano", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2013", "summary": "Abstract (from http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320714002882):  With ongoing global change, there is an urgent need to expand existing networks of important conservation areas around the world.

Recently, scientists have designed conservation networks that aim to explicitly represent the range of geophysical environments, identifying a network of physical stages that could sustain biodiversity while allowing for change in species composition in response to climate change. Because there is no standard approach to designing such networks, we compiled 8 case studies illustrating a variety of ways scientists have approached the challenge. These studies show how geodiversity has been partitioned and used to develop site portfolios and connectivity designs; how geodiversity-based portfolios compare with those derived from species and communities; and how the selection and combination of variables influences the results. Collectively, they suggest 4 key steps when using geodiversity to augment traditional biodiversity-based conservation planning: create land units from species-relevant variables combined in an ecologically meaningful way; represent land units in a logical spatial configuration and integrate with species locations when possible; apply selection criteria to individual sites to ensure they are appropriate for conservation; and develop connectivity among sites to maintain movements and processes.

Here, we advance a detailed classification and high-resolution map of physiography, built by combining landforms and lithology (soil parent material) at multiple spatial scales. We used only relatively static abiotic variables (i.e., excluded climatic and biotic factors) to prevent confounding current ecological patterns and processes with enduring landscape features, and to make the physiographic classification more interpretable for climate adaptation planning. We generated novel spatial databases for 15 landform and 269 physiographic types across the conterminous United States of America. We examined their potential use by natural resource managers by placing them within a contemporary climate change adaptation framework, and found our physiographic databases could play key roles in four of seven general adaptation strategies.

Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between landform diversity and measures of climate change to explore how changes may unfold across a geophysical template.

However, 'ecological drought' can be difficult to define, let alone to quantify, especially at spatial and temporal scales relevant to land managers. This is despite a growing need to integrate drought-related factors into management decisions as climate changes result in precipitation instability in many semi-arid ecosystems. We asked whether success in restoration seedings of the foundational species big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) was related to estimated water deficit, using the SoilWat2 model and data from &gt;600 plots located in previously burned areas in the western United States. Water deficit was characterized by: 1) the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI), a coarse-scale drought index, and 2) the number of days with wet and warm conditions in the near-surface soil, where seeds and seedlings germinate and emerge (i.e. days with 0-5 cm deep soil water potential &gt; -2.5 MPa and temperature above 0 \u00b0C). SPEI, a widely used drought index, was not predictive of whether sagebrush had reestablished. In contrast, wet-warm days elicited a critical drought threshold response, with successfully reestablished sites having experienced 7 more wet-warm days than unsuccessful sites during the first March following summer wildfire and restoration. Thus, seemingly small-scale and short-term changes in water availability and temperature can contribute to major ecosystem shifts, as many of these sites remained shrubless two decades later.

Although drought is an important driver of this mortality event, past and ongoing fire suppression and the consequent densification of forests may have contributed. In some areas, land management agencies have worked to reduce stand density through mechanical treatments and prescribed fire to restore forests to less dense, more open conditions that are presumably more resilient to disturbance and changing climate. Here, we evaluate if stand structural conditions associated with treated (e.g., thinned and prescribed burned) forests in the Sierra Nevada of California conferred more resistance to the bark beetle epidemic and drought event of 2012\u20132016. We found that, compared to untreated units, treated units had lower stand densities, larger average tree diameters, and greater dominance of pines (Pinus), the historically dominant trees. For all tree species studied, mortality was substantially greater in climatically drier areas (i.e., lower elevations and latitudes). Both pine species studied (ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa] and sugar pine [Pinus lambertiana]) had greater mortality in areas where their diameters were larger, suggesting a size preference for their insect mortality agents. For ponderosa pine, the tree species experiencing greatest mortality, individual\u2010tree mortality probability (for a given tree diameter) was significantly lower in treated stands. Ponderosa pine mortality was also positively related to density of medium\u2010 to large\u2010sized conspecific trees, especially in areas with lower precipitation, suggesting that abundance of nearby host trees for insect mortality agents was an important determinant of pine mortality. Mortality of incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) and white fir (Abies concolor) was positively associated with basal area, suggesting sensitivity to competition during drought, but overall mortality was lower, likely because the most prevalent and effective mortality agents (the bark beetles Dendroctonus brevicomis and D. ponderosae) are associated specifically with pine species within our study region.

For example, ecological niche model predictions can be used to rank species by degree of predicted future habitat loss. While many studies have considered how different modelling decisions contribute to uncertainty in niche model outputs, here we evaluate how metrics used to rank species by conservation risk respond to the choice of global climate models, greenhouse gas emission scenarios, suitable versus unsuitable threshold values, and the degree of model complexity.

We used ecological niche models to compare predicted climatic habitat suitability for 132 species of reptiles and amphibians in California, USA under the previous and current generations of climate simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5). We used data from seven global climate models for future (2014\u20132060) predictions under the following greenhouse gas emissions scenarios: SRES A2 for CMIP3 and RCP 8.5 for CMIP5. Ensembles of these climate models predicted a warmer and slightly wetter future California on average: CMIP3 + 2 \u00b0C mean annual temperature, +15 mm annual precipitation, CMIP5 + 2.5 \u00b0C mean annual temperature, +24 mm annual precipitation. CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles differed in where precipitation changes were predicted to be largest, with CMIP3 predicting greatest increased precipitation in the northern deserts and CMIP5 predicting greatest increased precipitation in the northern mountains. Under both sets of climate models (CMIP3 and CMIP5), mean habitat suitability within species ranges was predicted to decrease in the future. The degree of predicted decline was similar on average for CMIP3 and CMIP5, \u221215 % and \u221213 % respectively, suggesting that conclusions drawn from previous studies using ensembles of CMIP3 models are robust, at least for California. However, the effect of CMIP3 vs. CMIP5 on future mean habitat suitability depended strongly on which GCM was used: three GCMs predicted little change in future habitat suitability between CMIP3 and CMIP5 (MIROC, CNRM, GFDL), three predicted greater reductions in habitat suitability under CMIP3 (MPI, GISS, IPSL), and one predicted greater reductions in habitat suitability under CMIP5 (MRI).

Abstract: Natural climate variability will continue to be an important aspect of future regional climate even in the midst of long-term secular changes. Consequently, the ability of climate models to simulate major natural modes of variability and their teleconnections provides important context for the interpretation and use of climate change projections. Comparisons reported here indicate that the CMIP5 generation of global climate models shows significant improvements in simulations of key Pacific climate mode and their teleconnections to North America compared to earlier CMIP3 simulations. The performance of 14 models with simulations in both the CMIP3 and CMIP5 archives are assessed using singular value decomposition analysis of simulated and observed winter Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and concurrent precipitation over the contiguous United States and northwestern Mexico. Most of the models reproduce basic features of the key natural mode and their teleconnections, albeit with notable regional deviations from observations in both SST and precipitation. Increasing horizontal resolution in the CMIP5 simulations is an important, but not a necessary, factor in the improvement from CMIP3 to CMIP5.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/51c1b6d7e4b0dd0e00d92244", "parentId": "502bdd9be4b098307cc38b6f", "proj_id": "502bdd5fe4b098307cc38b67", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=51c1b6d7e4b0dd0e00d92244"}, "5ba00843e4b08583a5c27818": {"title": "Evidence that Recent Warming is Reducing Upper Colorado River Flows", "contacts": [{"name": "Gregory J.

These fires inspire concern about resiliency of ecosystems not adapted to fire, already threatened by sea-level rise (SLR), and under stress from extreme drought. We monitored vegetation percent cover, diversity, and soil organic carbon (SOC) in burned and unburned areas of the salt marsh following the 2013 Camarillo Springs Fire and used remotely sensed Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) analysis to verify the in situ data. Two years following the fire, vegetation percent cover in burned areas was significantly lower than in unburned areas, with dominant-species change in recovered areas, and NDVI was lower than pre-fire conditions. Multi-year disturbance, such as fire, presents challenges for salt marsh resilience and dependent species, especially in sites facing multiple stressors. With anticipated higher temperatures, increased aridity, extreme drought, and higher frequency fires becoming a reality for much of the Pacific coast, this study indicates that fire in Salicornia-dominated marshes is a vulnerability that will need to be addressed differently from other grass- or reed-dominated marsh systems.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d695ff1e4b0c4f70cf2730a", "parentId": "544e9418e4b02409068912fc", "proj_id": "52c5bc4be4b05415ea491452", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5d695ff1e4b0c4f70cf2730a"}, "5b6069f0e4b006a11f6a39bb": {"title": "Sea\u2010level rise, habitat loss, and potential extirpation of a salt marsh specialist bird in urbanized landscapes", "contacts": [{"name": "Jordan A.

The resulting maps suggest that suitable breeding and foraging habitat could decline as increased inundation converts middle\u2010 and high\u2010elevation suitable habitat to mudflat and subtidal zones. As a result, the highest SLR scenario predicted that no suitable breeding or foraging habitat would remain at any site by 2100 and 2110.

However, spatial and temporal patterns of inorganic sedimentation are poorly quantified within and across Salicornia pacifica (pickleweed)-dominated marshes. We compared vertical accretion rates and re-examined previously published suspended-sediment patterns during dry-weather periods at Seal Beach Wetlands, which is characterized by a mix of Spartina foliosa (cordgrass) and pickleweed, and for Mugu Lagoon, where cordgrass is rare. Mugu Lagoon occurs higher in the tidal frame and receives terrigenous sediment from an adjacent creek. Feldspar marker horizons were established in winter 2013\u20132014 to measure accretion. Accretion rates at Seal Beach Wetlands and Mugu Lagoon were 6 \u00b1 0.5 mm/year (mean \u00b1 SE) and 2 \u00b1 0.3 mm/year. Also, the estimated sediment flux (g/year) across the random feldspar plots was 3.5 times higher at Seal Beach Wetlands. At Mugu Lagoon, accretion was higher near creeks, although not statistically significant. Dry-weather SSC showed similar concentrations at transect locations across sites. During wet weather, however, SSC at Mugu Lagoon increased at all locations, with concentrations decaying farther than 8 m from tidal creek edge. Based on these results from Mugu Lagoon, we conclude accretion patterns are set by infrequent large flooding events in systems where there is a watershed sediment source.

As part of an ongoing collaborative modeling research program in the river system, researchers conduct annual interviews with key local water managers to characterize local climate adaptation strategies and implementation barriers, and identify science information needs to prioritize ongoing research activities. This article presents new findings from a third wave of interviews conducted with the same water managers following the historic 2017 wet year. Comparison of these data suggests that managers increased their adaptation efforts described during previous consecutive drought years (2015 and 2016). In 2017, comparatively fewer managers described climate uncertainty as an implementation barrier, exemplifying recent hydroclimate variability as the \u201cnew normal\u201d climate for which they should plan. An assessment of recent conditions reveals that recent water years bound historical observations and are consistent with estimated paleoclimate extremes in terms of magnitude, but not persistence, of both dry and wet conditions. Comparison to projected future climate conditions affirms managers\u2019 perspectives that increased hydroclimate variability, inclusive of drought and flood extremes, defines the new normal climate anticipated for the region. To support long-term adaptation planning, managers requested that researchers prioritize simulations of alternative water management strategies that account for nonstationary climate patterns and quantify implications system-wide.

Historical precipitation data from 1895 to 2013 are investigated to identify leading monthly indicators of annual drought in each of the seven climate divisions (CDs) as well as statewide. For this study, drought conditions are defined as monthly/annual (October\u2013September) precipitation below the 20th/30th percentile, and a leading indicator is defined as a monthly drought preceding or during an annual drought that has the strongest association (i.e., joint probability of occurrence) with a statewide annual drought. Monthly precipitation variability and contributions to annual precipitation, along with joint probabilities of drought among the winter months, are first analyzed. Then the probabilities of annual drought and the variability in leading indicators are analyzed according to different climate phases and CDs. This study identified December within a water year as being the leading indicator that is most frequently associated with annual drought statewide (56%) and in most of the CDs (the highest was CD2 at 65%).

CMV forecasts assume clouds move in the direction of the average regional wind field, which is not necessarily the case for Sc clouds. Sc clouds over the land form at night and typically reach their maximum coverage before sunrise. During the day, heating from solar radiation at the surface and entrainment of dry and warm air from above causes Sc clouds to dissipate. A Sc cloud edge forecast using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite is proposed to improve Sc cloud dissipation forecasts during the day. The inland edge of the Sc clouds is tracked in time and extrapolated into the future. For coastal regions where land elevation increases away from the coast, such as coastal California, the Sc cloud inland boundary is correlated to the land elevation. Dissipation after sunrise often follows land elevation as the mass of air required to be heated to become cloud-free decreases with increasing elevation as cloud top height is fairly constant along the cloud edge. The correlation between land elevation and the Sc cloud eastern boundary is exploited by extrapolating the evolution of cloud edge elevation in time. This method is tested in central and northern California on 25\u202fdays and in southern California on 19\u202fdays.

Recent advances in cloud computing have provided new opportunities to examine ecological responses to climate variability over the past few decades and at large spatial scales. In this study, we characterized the sensitivities (magnitude and direction of the slope) of meadow vegetation responses to interannual variations in climate. We calculated sensitivity as the regression slope between a 31\u2010year (1985\u20132016) time series of Landsat\u2010derived vegetation indices characterizing late\u2010season vegetation vigour and water balance variables from the Basin Characterization Model. We identified April 1 snowpack as the climate variable the majority of meadows were most sensitive to. We assessed how vegetation sensitivities to snowpack varied with hydrogeomorphic context (e.g., climate, geology, soils, watershed geometry, and land cover) across the Sierra Nevada mountain range using factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the hydrogeomorphic data and multiple linear regression to model sensitivity responses. We found that meadow sensitivities to snowpack varied with long\u2010term average meadow climate, indicators of watershed subsurface water storage capacity, and indicators of meadow vegetation composition. Alpine and subalpine meadows with high average annual precipitation but limited catchment subsurface storage exhibited the largest sensitivities.

Three existing bias correction methods, and a new one developed here, are applied to daily maximum temperature and precipitation from 21 GCMs to investigate how different methods alter the climate change signal of the GCM. The quantile mapping (QM) and cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) bias correction methods can significantly alter the GCM\u2019s mean climate change signal, with differences of up to 2\u00b0C and 30% points for monthly mean temperature and precipitation, respectively. Equidistant quantile matching (EDCDFm) bias correction preserves GCM changes in mean daily maximum temperature but not precipitation. An extension to EDCDFm termed PresRat is introduced, which generally preserves the GCM changes in mean precipitation. Another problem is that GCMs can have difficulty simulating variance as a function of frequency. To address this, a frequency-dependent bias correction method is introduced that is twice as effective as standard bias correction in reducing errors in the models\u2019 simulation of variance as a function of frequency, and it does so without making any locations worse, unlike standard bias correction.

The localized constructed analogs (LOCA) method produces downscaled estimates suitable for hydrological simulations using a multiscale spatial matching scheme to pick appropriate analog days from observations. First, a pool of candidate observed analog days is chosen by matching the model field to be downscaled to observed days over the region that is positively correlated with the point being downscaled, which leads to a natural independence of the downscaling results to the extent of the domain being downscaled. Then, the one candidate analog day that best matches in the local area around the grid cell being downscaled is the single analog day used there. Most grid cells are downscaled using only the single locally selected analog day, but locations whose neighboring cells identify a different analog day use a weighted combination of the center and adjacent analog days to reduce edge discontinuities. By contrast, existing constructed analog methods typically use a weighted average of the same 30 analog days for the entire domain. By greatly reducing this averaging, LOCA produces better estimates of extreme days, constructs a more realistic depiction of the spatial coherence of the downscaled field, and reduces the problem of producing too many light-precipitation days.

This technique combines the ability of dynamical downscaling to capture finescale dynamics with the computational savings of a statistical model to downscale multiple GCMs. First, dynamical downscaling is applied to five GCMs. Guided by an understanding of the underlying local dynamics, a simple statistical model is built relating the GCM input and the dynamically downscaled output. This statistical model is used to approximate the warming patterns of the remaining GCMs, as if they had been dynamically downscaled. The full 32-member ensemble allows for robust estimates of the most likely warming and uncertainty resulting from intermodel differences.

Both monthly and daily timescale changes in T and P are addressed, the latter being important for a range of applications in energy use, water management, and agriculture. The T changes tend to agree more across downscaling techniques than the P changes. Year-to-year natural internal climate variability is roughly of similar magnitude to the projected T changes. In the monthly average, July temperatures shift enough that that the hottest July found in any simulation over the historical period becomes a modestly cool July in the future period. Januarys as cold as any found in the historical period are still found in the 2060s, but the median and maximum monthly average temperatures increase notably. Annual and seasonal P changes are small compared to interannual or intermodel variability. However, the annual change is composed of seasonally varying changes that are themselves much larger, but tend to cancel in the annual mean.

Two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are considered, corresponding to greenhouse gas emission reductions over coming decades (RCP2.6) and to continued twenty-first-century emissions increases (RCP8.5). All available global climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are downscaled to provide likelihood and uncertainty estimates. By the end of century under RCP8.5, a distinctly new regional climate state emerges: average temperatures will almost certainly be outside the interannual variability range seen in the baseline. Except for the highest elevations and a narrow swath very near the coast, land locations will likely see 60\u201390 additional extremely hot days per year, effectively adding a new season of extreme heat. In mountainous areas, a majority of the many baseline days with freezing nighttime temperatures will most likely not occur. According to a similarity metric that measures daily temperature variability and the climate change signal, the RCP8.5 end-of-century climate will most likely be only about 50% similar to the baseline. For midcentury under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 and end of century under RCP2.6, these same measures also indicate a detectable though less significant climatic shift.

Our vulnerability study uses a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate climate change vulnerability of an urbanized coastal community that could serve as a model approach for communities worldwide, particularly in similar Mediterranean climates. We synthesize projected changes in climate, coastal erosion and flooding, watershed runoff and impacts to two important coastal ecosystems, sandy beaches and coastal salt marshes. Using downscaled climate models along with other regional models, we find that temperature, extreme heat events, and sea level are expected to increase in the future, along with more intense rainfall events, despite a negligible change in annual rainfall. Consequently, more droughts are expected but the magnitude of larger flood events will increase. Associated with the continuing rise of mean sea level, extreme coastal water levels will occur with increasingly greater magnitudes and frequency. Severe flooding will occur for both natural (wetlands, beaches) and built environments (airport, harbor, freeway, and residential areas). Adaptation actions can reduce the impact of rising sea level, which will cause losses of sandy beach zones and salt marsh habitats that support the highest biodiversity in these ecosystems, including regionally rare and endangered species, with substantial impacts occurring by 2050.

Recently, Southern California has experienced record-breaking high temperatures coupled with significant precipitation deficits, which provides opportunities to investigate the impacts of high temperatures on the drought sensitivity of Mediterranean climate vegetation. Responses of different vegetation types to drought are quantified using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the period 2000\u20132017. The contrasting responses of the vegetation types to drought are captured by the correlation and regression coefficients between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomalies and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). A novel bootstrapping regression approach is used to decompose the relationships between the vegetation sensitivity (NDVI\u2013PDSI regression slopes) and the principle climate factors (temperature and precipitation) associated with the drought. Significantly increased sensitivity to drought in warmer locations indicates the important role of temperature in exacerbating vulnerability; however, spatial precipitation variations do not demonstrate significant effects in modulating drought sensitivity. Based on annual NDVI response, chaparral is the most vulnerable community to warming, which will probably be severely affected by hotter droughts in the future. Drought sensitivity of coastal sage scrub (CSS) is also shown to be very responsive to warming in fall and winter. Grassland and developed land will likely be less affected by this warming. The sensitivity of the overall vegetation to temperature increases is particularly concerning, as it is the variable that has had the strongest secular trend in recent decades, which is expected to continue or strengthen in the future. Increased temperatures will probably alter vegetation distribution, as well as possibly increase annual grassland cover, and decrease the extent and ecological services provided by perennial woody Mediterranean climate ecosystems as well.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e9dc03c82ce172707fb8d16", "parentId": "5d24dd63e4b0941bde64fd03", "proj_id": "5d24dc63e4b0941bde64fcf8", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5e9dc03c82ce172707fb8d16"}, "56058c1fe4b058f706e5147c": {"title": "Forest exposure (vulnerability) index, 2061-2080, based on MRI-CGCM3 RCP85", "contacts": [{"name": "Mark Schwartz", "type": "Point of Contact", "email": "mwschwartz@ucdavis.edu", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2012", "summary": "Exposure (vulnerability) index for the future time period (2061-2080) representing projected climate conditions from the Meteorological Research Institute's Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model, version 3, and the rcp85 emissions scenario.

Tribal communities and indigenous peoples across the United States are reenvisioning the role of science in the Anthropocene; working to strengthen government-to-government relationships in climate change initiatives; and leading climate change research, mitigation and adaptation plans through indigenous ingenuity. Unique adaptive capacities of tribal communities stem from their ethics and knowledge, and help frame and guide successful adaptation. As documented in the Special Issue of the Climatic Change Journal on the impacts of climate change to U.S. indigenous communities (Maldonado and others 2013), these issues include the loss of traditional knowledge; impacts to forests, ecosystems, traditional foods, and water; thawing of Arctic sea ice and permafrost; and relocation of communities. This collaboration, by more than 50 authors from tribal communities, academia, government agencies, and NGOs, demonstrates the increasing awareness, interest, and need to understand the unique ways in which climate change will affect tribal cultures, lands, and traditional ways of life. Climate change is expected to affect animal and plant species that indigenous people depend on for their livelihoods, health and cultural practices.

Preliminary socio-economic data and analysis reveal that the tribe\u2019s vulnerability to climate change is related to cultural and economic dependence on Pyramid Lake, while external socio-economic vulnerability factors influence adaptive capacity and amplify potential impacts.

We present an approach that provides insight into how periodic infiltration forcings at the land surface filter in a layered vadose zone in terms of changes in the timing and magnitude of hydrologic responses. To represent geologically realistic systems, we used vertical sequences of one-dimensional periodic solutions, where each solution represents a single soil in a layered profile. The overall approach is based on a linearized Richards equation and assumes that the effects on flow of continuous pressure head changes at soil interfaces are negligible. We evaluated the limit of these approximations by comparison with results from the numerical model HYDRUS-1D, which uses the full Richards equation. We compared (i) the depth at which flux variations became steady, and (ii) the travel time of wetting fronts to reach a depth of 3 m. The solution was reasonably accurate (error less than a factor of 2) for infiltration cycles with periods from 30 to 365 d and for fluxes common in arid and semiarid environments (0\u20132 mm d\u22121). Lag times between a surface forcing and response at any depth were accurate (error less than a factor of 1.1).

We forecast the risk-reduction benefits to natural landscapes of lowering business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions by comparing the extent and spatial patterns of climate exposure to dominant vegetation under current emissions trajectories (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP8.5) and envisioned Paris Accord target emissions (RCP4.5). This comparison allows us to assess the ecosystem value of reaching targets to keep global temperature warming under 2\u00b0C. Using 350,719 km2 of natural lands in California, USA, and the mapped extents of 30 vegetation types, we identify each type's current bioclimatic envelope by the frequency with which it occupies current climate conditions. We then map the trajectory of each pixel's climate under the four climate futures to quantify areas expected to fall within, become marginal to (outside a 95% probability contour), or move beyond their current climate conditions by the end of the 21st century. In California, these four future climates represent temperature increases of 1.9\u20134.5\u00b0C and a \u221224.8 to +22.9% change in annual precipitation by 2100. From 158,481 to 196,493 km2 (45\u201356%) of California's natural vegetation is predicted to become highly climatically stressed under current emission levels (RCP8.5) under the drier and wetter global climate models, respectively.

In 2014, during California\u2019s 2012\u20132016 \u201chotter\u201d drought in which higher temperatures exacerbated the effects of low water availability, many giant sequoia trees in the Sierra Nevada mountains exhibited foliage dieback at levels previously unreported. We hypothesized that this apparent drought-induced foliage dieback was associated with spatial patterns of site water balance and consequently tree water status and physiology. As part of an ongoing collaborative project aimed at understanding and mapping giant sequoia drought response and vulnerability at leaf to landscape scales, in 2015, 2016 and 2017 we climbed and measured leaf-level water status and physiology of mature and seedling giant sequoia trees at sites exhibiting low and high average foliage dieback in Giant Forest, Sequoia National Park. We also compared our 2015\u20132017 measurements with similar measurements made in giant sequoias prior to the commencement of the 2012\u20132016 drought. We found that during the drought, leaf water potentials of both mature and seedling sequoias were as low or lower than any previous measurements, and leaf water potentials of some seedlings were as low as the tops of mature trees. In contrast to our expectations, we found similar water potentials in both foliage dieback classes, although there was a high degree of within-site variability and in some measurement periods trees and seedlings growing in flat or meadow-side topographic positions had higher water potentials than those growing on mid- or upslope positions with presumably less favorable water supply. Leaf-level adjustments included multiple mechanisms to reduce water loss and resist the effects of desiccation at both seasonal and annual time scales, including stomatal closure, redistribution of leaf water to less mobile storage, and a shift in leaf carbon fractions to build tougher, more drought-resistant foliage. Our results suggest that giant sequoia employs a drought avoidance water regulation strategy and leaf-level adjustments are sufficient to maintain relatively isohydric water potentials above critical thresholds under most conditions. Because of the high severity of the 2012\u20132016 drought, however, the capacity for leaf-level compensation in some giant sequoias was overwhelmed and both leaf- and crown-level adjustments were necessary to maintain favorable water status to protect whole-tree hydraulic functioning. Additional research aimed at understanding and monitoring the consequences of future hotter droughts is necessary in order to determine the long-term persistence of giant sequoias within their current geographic distribution.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b3124ede4b040769c13f854", "parentId": "57c60aa5e4b0f2f0cebdabb2", "proj_id": "57c604e2e4b0f2f0cebdab96", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5b3124ede4b040769c13f854"}, "5a26f761e4b03852baf9ac8a": {"title": "Southwest Tribal Climate Change Assessment Final Report", "contacts": [{"name": "Katharine L Jacobs", "type": "Principal Investigator", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2016", "summary": "The Native Nations Climate Adaptation Program (NNCAP) was founded in 2015 with the mission to build capacity to work collaboratively with Native American tribes and indigenous populations in the western United States and Mexico.

We investigate the hydrologic impacts of 122 ARs that occurred in the Salt and Verde river basins in northeastern Arizona during the cold seasons from 1979 to 2009. We focus on the relationship between precipitation, snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture, and extreme flooding. During the cold season (October through March) ARs contribute an average of 25%/29% of total seasonal precipitation for the Salt/Verde river basins, respectively. However, they contribute disproportionately to total heavy precipitation and account for 64%/72% of extreme total daily precipitation (exceeding the 98th percentile). Excess precipitation during AR occurrences contributes to snow accumulation; on the other hand, warmer than normal temperatures during AR landfallings are linked to rain-on-snow processes, an increase in the basins' area contributing to runoff generation, and higher melting lines. Although not all AR events are linked to extreme flooding in the basins, they do account for larger runoff coefficients. On average, ARs generate 43% of the annual maximum flows for the period studied, with 25% of the events exceeding the 10 year return period. Our analysis shows that the devastating 1993 flooding event in the region was caused by AR events. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity on the hydrology of inland semiarid regions: ARs are critical for water resources, but they can also lead to extreme flooding that affects infrastructure and human activities.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a8c5b77e4b00f54eb4471c2", "parentId": "552bccd6e4b026915857df94", "proj_id": "552bcad2e4b026915857df6b", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5a8c5b77e4b00f54eb4471c2"}, "5bedbddce4b0b3fc5cf923f1": {"title": "Extreme Landfalling Atmospheric River Events in Arizona: Possible Future Changes", "contacts": [{"name": "Itinderjot Singh", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Francina Dominguez", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Eleonora Demaria", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "James Walter", "type": "Author", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Southwest CASC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "Abstract (from AGU10): The semiarid Salt and Verde River Basins in Arizona are susceptible to atmospheric river (AR)\u2010related flooding. To understand the precipitation\u2010related impacts of climate change on extreme ARs affecting Arizona, a pseudo\u2010global warming method was used. High\u2010resolution control and future simulations of five intense historical AR events that affected the Salt and Verde River Basins in Central Arizona were carried out using the Weather Research and Forecasting regional climate model. The pseudo\u2010global warming approach for future simulations involved adding a temperature delta at different vertical levels to the historical initial and lateral boundary conditions of the input data while keeping constant relative humidity. The deltas were calculated using projected changes toward end of the 21st century from an ensemble of nine Global Climate Models for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. Future simulations showed an overall increase in vertically integrated transport of vapor and upward moisture flux at cloud base over the region for all events. The changes in precipitation at both domain and basin levels were highly spatially heterogeneous. Precipitation increased in all future simulations; but in general, this increase remained less than the increase in column\u2010integrated water vapor. It was found that in most cases, cloud ice content decreased while cloud water content increased, indicating the increased role of warm\u2010rain processes in producing precipitation in the future simulations. Freezing levels rose by more than 600 m, and this along with increased temperature and greater role of warm\u2010rain processes led to a decrease of more than 80% in the amount of frozen precipitation during the events.", "url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5bedbddce4b0b3fc5cf923f1", "parentId": "552bccd6e4b026915857df94", "proj_id": "552bcad2e4b026915857df6b", "purpose": "", "relatedItemsUrl": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5bedbddce4b0b3fc5cf923f1"}, "57daca21e4b090824ffc3161": {"title": "Tribal Leaders Summit on Climate Change: A Focus on Climate Adaptation Planning and Implementation", "contacts": [{"name": "Katharine Jacobs", "type": "Principal Investigator", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}, {"name": "Southwest CSC", "type": "Funding Agency", "email": "", "jobTitle": "", "orcId": ""}], "casc": "Southwest CASC", "fy": "2015", "summary": "The University of Arizona Native Nations Climate Adaptation Program (NNCAP) and Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions (CCASS) hosted the NNCAP Tribal Leaders Summit on Climate Change: A Focus on Climate Adaptation Planning and Implementation at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona on November 12 and 13, 2015.
